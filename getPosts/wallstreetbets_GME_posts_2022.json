    "selftext": "In the words of Mike Jones, #DISCK-DONT-FAIL-ME-NOW and in the words of u/Slicklickfstick \\#LONG-DISCK-IS-ALL-THE-DD-I-NEED\n\n**EDIT; Ah the huge pop today was because DISC was** [fully cleared by the European Commission for the merger to proceed](https://www.barrons.com/articles/discovery-disca-stock-warnermedia-merger-europe-51641237897) **- Woohoo, things are finally in motion!**\n\n**EDIT 2 07.01.22; Nice pop today with BofA upgrading to Buy and price target of $45 :D**\n\n**TLDR;** This stock has been battered out of the Archegos scandal and concerns over debt in the upcoming merger, but is surprisingly overlooked as a potential value play in a market that is starved for value, and long overdue for a reasonable return after nearly a year of capitulation. Stock may be flat until merger, but it would be wise to start building a position now as the capitulation may have reached a floor (see 7-10% gain in first day of trading for 2022).\n\n**Disclosure;** I am long DISCA and long DISCK.\n\n**Target;** DISC trades at a significant discount in forward EV/EBITDA (x8.45) compared to competitors NFLX (x32.7) and DISNEY (x22). ARPU stands to grow from $7 - $11 at merger, an increase of 57%. Conservatively, were EV/EBITDA to grow linearly in accordance to x13.27, it would still trade at a discount to its peers and a share price of \\~$36 (56% upside)\n\n**Tip;** Prefer DISCK over DISCA (voting) shares as DISCK still trades at a discount and all shares will be rolled into the same class of newco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Up 7.4&amp;#37; in first day of trading of 2022, with a high of 9.5&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/w02ej7e7ti981.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03fb96e4ed7f1539b4f2f1501481a598507cb8fc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nThe DISC merger, expected in Q2 2022 - where T spins off its Warner Media division (including HBO) to form NewCo is one of the biggest upcoming deals this year.\n\nLooking at the IP portfolio for newco is staggering - 200000 hours of content spanning WB, HBO (Dune, Matrix, Succession, Westworld, GoT...), TLC, HGTV (basically all the reality tv), DISC, TNT, CNN, Olympics and more. It spans a massive content sector (specific to un/scripted reality-tv, sports, major film releases for the remaining cable-cutting audience that consumes this particular content) for the streaming industry that is lacking in the current streaming ecosystem (eg, most of this material was pulled from Hulu). DISC carries massive international potential through its reach across 220+ countries and 50 languages (eg, [DISC holds exclusive rights for Olympics broadcasting in Europe until 2024 - with the next Olympics around the corner - valued at 1.4B](https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-awards-all-tv-and-multiplatform-broadcast-rights-in-europe-to-discovery-and-eurosport-for-2018-2024-olympic-games)). Another key issue was the simple inability for non US markets to access/subscribe to HBO until the launch of HBO max for Latin America and Europe in late 2021. There's no question the content library is there, but what about the numbers?\n\nWith an TTM PE of 17 (vs. NFLX 53, DISNEY 142) and only 20M subscribers vs. NFLX 240M and DISNEY 118M - and an estimated newco growth to \\~100M via the merger this year (76M via HBO Max, 22M from DISC) the potential for growth is quite apparent. The combined Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) stands to be $11/user (or 1.10B/month - 13.2B/year with a free cash flow of 7.83B/year. With DISC ARPU currently at approximately $7, this is a 57% gain in ARPU immediately at merger. With a conservative estimate of a mere 5% user growth per year, we reach approximately 130M subscribers by 2026. (AT&amp;T guidance alone [expects 150M for HBO max alone for 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/att-expects-120-million-to-150-million-hbo-max-subs-by-end-of-2025.html)).  Management forecasts cost-savings through the merger (reducing marketing spend of independent entities into one), but say ARPU remains consistent in the worst case scenario, that increases revenue to 1.43B for 2026 of 17.16B/year. The two companies currently produce an average FCF at around 59%, which again, in the worst case scenario (remaining flat) brings us to a conservative estimate for FCF of 10.3B/year. Future CEO, David Zaslav [points to a long term goal of 400M subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/david-zaslav-on-subscriber-goals-for-combined-discovery-warnermedia.html) which would bring this estimate even higher.\n\nManagement has expressed expectations to reduce gross debt down from 5.0x gross debt/EBITDA within a few years. Given the conservative FCF growth estimate of 33%, this seems reasonable.\n\nT holders receive 71% in newco, DISC holders receive remaining 29%. This presents a potential 112.45B EV and 60B of debt for a total market cap of 52.45B for newco, and an estimated 2.4m shares outstanding at the current price \\~ $22.90.\n\n\\--\n\nFinally, for those of you that like a short squeeze, DISCA currently holds a FF% of 13.5% and Days to Cover of 10.14 (compare to AMC 20%, 2.35, GME 16.46% 4.37, SNDL 18.6% 3.38) according to the latest data from Ortex.\n\n\\--\n\nAdding FT analyst coverage, actually amazing the analyst median estimate hits the exact same $36 mark.\n\n[Financial Times Consensus analyst floor estimate of 26, Med 36, High 61 as of 03.01.21](https://preview.redd.it/ca538ygq1k981.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6251407f89ee6fd526671318741a183762f70233)",

    "selftext": "GameStop Corp. is launching a division to develop a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and establish coin partnerships, according to people familiar with its plans, pushing the company into much-hyped areas as it tries to turn around its core videogame business.\n\nThe retailer has hired more than 20 people to run the unit, which is building an online hub for buying, selling and trading NFTs of virtual videogame goods such as avatar outfits and weapons, according to the people. The company is asking select game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace when it launches later this year, the people said.\n\nGameStop also is close to signing partnerships with two coin companies to share technology and co-invest in the development of games that use blockchain and NFT technology, as well as other NFT-related projects, the people said. The retailer expects to enter into similar agreements with a dozen or more coin companies and invest tens of millions of dollars in them this year, the people said.\n\nGrapevine, Texas-based GameStop has been working to reset its business after years of losses. The company was at the center of a stock-trading frenzy last year that dramatically boosted its share price, which rode a surge in interest and optimism from individual investors. Many saw potential in GameStop despite the pandemic\u2019s negative impact on foot traffic and even though consumers have been increasingly opting to download and stream games over the internet, rather than buy the kind of hard copies that the company specializes in selling.\n\nLast year, GameStop overhauled its executive team and board of directors, naming activist investor Ryan Cohen as chairman. Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. and sold it for $3.35 billion in 2017, has been pushing to make GameStop more tech-centric.\n\nEdit- Have seen comments on this news being a smokescreen as a cover for shorts' FTD cycle covering, which indeed make sense and I don't disagree with them.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m one of the retards here with 5 figures loss porn. Others too I\u2019m sure are hurt. \n\nI\u2019ve been depressed and mentally drained since the new year, and since I\u2019m graduating college in May it\u2019s hard to just go back into the workforce right now since I\u2019m traveling from school, back home, gonna be getting a real job in the summer (god willing). By the time places like Wendy\u2019s or retail hire me I\u2019ll be quitting. I\u2019ve been looking for remote work with no use. I have mondays, Wednesdays, and fridays off next semester and I have no idea what I\u2019ll do. \n\nI have less than 1k in my bank and I go to college in a few weeks. Off campus and do my own shopping and shit. I had 5 figures in august. I\u2019m nervous as fuck for this semester. This was supposed to be the time of my life and I ruined it. Anyone college aged here, please be careful and don\u2019t end up like me.\n\nEdit: you guys really inspired me. Thanks. I\u2019ll come back stronger than ever.\n\nEdit 2: thank you for the concerns, but I\u2019m not a gambling addict. If I was, I would\u2019ve yolo\u2019d into Gme calls today and I didn\u2019t.

    "title": "Put/Call Plays next week: QQQ, AMD, GME, Peni Stonks",
    "selftext": "QQQ - Went in on SQQQ (inverse qqq) calls end of day friday. SQQQ is cheaper and you can buy more, out further while % profits are similar. the tnx ticker tracks 10 yr yields which a lot investors use as an inflation tracker and it has made a pretty fucking scary cup and handle that's breaking out. held these overnight because there's a strong likelihood of a heavy premarket drop.\n\n* Calls on SQQQ or puts on QQQ ITM\n* Currently sitting at resistance/support but also under 100ma\n* gap to fill by the 200ma and strong support under it but i think tech's bull run is over.\n* Holding the majority of my SQQQ calls till it hits the 200ma then will reposition after a bounce/rest period. 371ish is a good spot to take some profits and i will.\n\nGME - Beautiful bearish pennant (nov-current) that's broke, retested and hammered down again to the 140 support. Under pretty much all moving averages on daily and 1hr. the FTD/NFT pop showed a really weak hand for the GME pump imo.\n\n* Under 140, ITM puts with a watch on 130 and 120 support areas (areas not specific. Mapping with boxes is better to keep that mindset.) Take profits in these areas and re-enter if drop continues\n* Looking for a quick drop/pop at open. Trade the bounce off of that not the initial drop. Gaps love to fill. Keep eyes on the Fiblvls and 9ma. I love using pivot point indicator as well.\n* Under 120 and the next stop is 115ish. Break of 115... i'll likely overnight puts bought end of day. Interested to see when the AH/PM drop happens.\n* Just an observation: Hopium GME'rs have noted calls from last year expire soon. MM loves to make those as worthless as possible. incentive from MM would be to heavy drive this down before jan 22.\n\nAMD - on watch. no play yet. Jan 11th is a decision deadline from China on the merger. I have very little faith in China playing in favor of anyone. I might take a yolo over night put:call 4:1 out of the money play. make money on it one way or the other. That decision will drive it 20$ north or south quickly.\n\n* Bearish 3 bar set up as of now. Solid support at 132ish. Under most of the moving averages\n* There is a ridiculous amount of ITM Puts vs Calls on AMD for Jan 22 exp. Big money might know something that we dont (hence 4:1 play)\n* China Nice: pop AH/PM with light resistance around 143 and heavy resistance around 150. breaking out of the down trend started in december is unlikely given the current downward tech pressure. Will look at Puts around that 143/150 area if it turns\n* China Mean: Drop AH/PM with light support around 119ish. Strong support around 100$. Will look at daily play from 119 down.\n\nPENI STONKS - I was born and raised on peni bios. Its a brutal learning experience for sure lol. Bearish is a must in them, but there is a lot of very promising smol cap plays that are due for a survival pump. And the recent OI jump for Jan 22 exp ITM calls in the ones that i've watched/traded through 2021. its  looking like its time for that.\n\n* OI spiked 10x normal OI in the past week or so\n* Cant post peni on WSB. will set up a post elsewhere if peaks your interest.\n* High risk. Manipulated af.\n* Many of these have Great Fundamentals and are trading with a market cap well below revenues.\n* Look for Jan exp OI thats way higher than normal. with charts that make you want to vomit and everyone on stocktwits losing their minds.\n* take profits take profits take profits. 30% at a time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be33qp20mqa81.jpg?width=1773&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f1d6322d1807d36cea789641049420616bc9dc",

I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a ticking bomb, or that there\u2019s an underlying market structure factors that will cause a positive feedback loop leading to a price explosion. \n\nNone of the You Tube content by the Reddit pundits makes any sense. I think these punters are all just under water on their 2021 long positions; so they are inventing a squeeze headline hoping to move the stock up.\n\nThe main SEC report showed that buying to cover was a small proportion of the total volume. The whole rally was just just a self fulfilling prophesy. Therefore, all the pundits are anchoring on it; making up some conspiracy theory of a gamma squeeze, the T+35 theory and dwelling on the FTD\u2019s. \n\nIt might have another pop, but it won\u2019t be due to gamma, or the MOASS\u2019s; it\u2019ll just be a momentum move because the Redditer\u2019s find the balls to lift the ask again.

    "title": "The Ape Mentality DD",
    "selftext": "Imagine if someone came to you and asked you for 1,000 dollars. You would tell them hell no fuck off (unless you're super generous) or you'd want a return if you loaned it out. (Keep this in mind)\n\n\nApes are WSB's best and worst event to happen to it **so far**.(I was into stocks but didnt know about WSB until GME)\nPeople randomly bought a stock and believed that it would go up, and against all odds too. It went up and people made their money and even DFV held through the runs of it all. So what went wrong?\n\n\n#Goalpost moving\n\n\nFor the next 12 months, apes would try to replicate what happened 1 year ago. Some people made youtube channels, started subs and made up lingos and words for apes to use for the newly formed cult. In my opinion, the orginal goal and thought process behind these apes is that they wanted Wallstreetbets to be all GME posts only.. any other play was considered \"distraction\" by traders who had no experince or idea how the market works. This eventually will come back to haunt them\n\n\nEvery time a theory fails the apes suffer from short term memory loss due to the amount of yelling in their echo chambers and they come up with some excuse as of why the stocks havent squeezed. It's with my best opinion that most of them have gotten used to blaming it on one man without considering the validity of their own comments and persuasions. The \"DD\" writers have become Self-Glorified idols to the apes and leads them in any and whatever direction they want to them\n\n\nFrom personal experience, Apes work like this: \n\n\n\u2022DD writer writes a EXTREMELY Long and Overcomplicated Article confusing apes and even normal investors.\n\n\n\u2022Apes look at TLDR or ask for one: \"DRS\" \"GameStop is the only Idiosyncratic risk\" (I've never used Idiosyncratic a day in my life and these people havent either, but all of a sudden everyone uses it now?) \"buy and hodl\"\n\n\nThey aren't experienced and they aren't thinking about what's being said. That's why when you ask any of them about current speculation all they can go back to is that one page of the SEC report that they have been **TOLD**! That's right, they were **TOLD** they didn't even read the fucking report themselves. That the shorts did not cover although, on page 25 it says the shorts covered their positions. \n\n\n#Toxicity\n\n\nThis is breeding from 3 things: Pride, Narcissism and The overwhelming bags these investors are carrying. They have made mistakes **but Have Too much Pride** to admit that they were fooled or duped. It's easy to handle your problems when you blame someone else for the cause of it. It's hard when you have to look in the mirror everyday and see the fuck up that was your own doing by your own hands. They have convinced themselves that the little bit of money they put in will wield great rewards.\n\n\nIts the mentality of a lottery winner, but these guys missed the call outs and still bought tickets that night expecting a 2nd call. These people have been infiltraded from Paraniod anti-vaxxers (AMC) to Qanon(GME) and their ideas of how the world and trading world works have been warped by mentally unstable grifters. They believe that everyone of us and everyone else is paid to downtalk GME and all of their other crazy theories when in reality, the people they go to are making money off them pumping and dumping the stock.\n\n\nIt's quite the spectacular event when you think about it. This is bigger than Heaven's Gate, there are hundreds of thousands of people right now who do not understand how the market works and will never invest in it again after it is done. The toxicty and angry behavior of these people comes from the denial of being robbed of a \"proper\" squeeze last year. Anyone who invests in these companies does not care for it, they simply are in it for the \"Moass\" and thats it.\n\n\nA lot of these apes if not all of them are poor, none of them are making the income they need to sustain themselves. Some of them threw everything they had: Stimulus, 401ks, everything and never considered the possibility of them losing it all. It would be easy for them to just sell but Sunk Cost Fallocy and hope that the \"DD\" is right has them to believe that the stock will go back up and their investments im the stock will breakeven or if not go back up (see first paragraph).\n\n\n#Enter the cult\n\n\nSS is a cult reddit that constantly tries to pump the stock of GME by tagging revery time they believe that the stock is on the brink of a dramatic increase in price. They have formed a echo chamber where any criticism of the stock is banned, any criticism of the DD writers and DD is FUD, and every sub that doesn't follow these rules is \"compromised\". The only place you will see any DD writers are in their own echo chambers, they have to stick to the fantasy world or they'd get called out by reality in a heartbeat. \n\n\nThis brings us to WSB where everyone here dlesnt care and tries to make a play. The apes feel like this sub should be where their voice is heard... but that's the only voice that they believe should be heard. This is dangerous for the sub and for anyone who is just getting started in losing money (lose money with class retard, not going down a cult rabbit hole).\n\n\nI personally think it would take GME going down to 20 dollars for these people to realize they have been had. Even then you'll still have those too stubborn, too stupid, too narcissist to admit they were wrong. If you are in a society,  one great way to see who rules over you is to see who you're not allowed to criticize or question the rights and rules of.\n\n\nFor these reasons and many more, Im declaring puts on GME and I will be shorting the stock. (Vangaurd makes it hard for me to post here). My strike prices will go out 6 months from the current date and my puts are not for the company.. but for the batshit crazy ass apes that bought the stock and are trying to pump new bagholders in it out of pure greed.\n\nEdit: Apes trying to suppress this post you can run away from the truth only but so long. Everyday your stock gets lower",

    "title": "Reversal of the deflated college degree - The catalyst for the next Tech Bubble",
    "selftext": " \n\nI believe we are going to be entering a BS degree salary bubble within the next 4-5 years which will inevitably lead to artificially pumped assets, revenues and then a burst. \n\n**The value of the trade - Pre 1960\u2019s**\n\nBefore the 1960s, if you were a male you graduated high school, got your GED, dropped out to smoke weed with your friends and go to rock concerts, etc. Those that graduated/GED went into a trade, got a girlfriend,  making good money, drinking a bunch of beer, buying a house, having a family, life\u2019s good right? Life is easy when it\u2019s simple, you got your wife in the kitchen making your sandwiches and getting your beer, taking your anger out on your kid, your mortgage rate is kind of high but your down payment was cheap as fuck and it\u2019s going to appreciate like a mother fucker for the next 60years just you wait. Now, those who didn\u2019t graduate and dropped out spent all their time and money doing coke at rock concerts, getting DUI\u2019s, fucking groupies, dropping acid, etc. They accumulate some debt, do this for 5-10yrs, now they sober up after one of their friends hits a car and drives into a tree while drunk driving killing themselves, their friend and the people in the car that they hit. What do they do? They go into a trade. They are making good money, sobered up, pay off their debts, buy a car, get a girlfriend, buy a house, their life is back on track. The value of the trade lied in its respectability, its necessity and its pay. People still got degrees back then, but you were largely criticized for being a nerd, not having street smarts, not paying your dues, etc. I mean for what it\u2019s worth, why pay for experience with your head in a book when you can get paid for the experience and learn with your hands like a real man?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8zf905eera81.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d893df3a69c169caa69f402c5e7e7bc031c6529b\n\n**The value of the degree - 1960 - 2009**\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into a history lesson about the 1960\u2019s because everyone knows what happened. I will sum it up by saying it was a cultural and educational renaissance for the US. The movement\u2019s drove people to Colleges and Universities, the increase in demand made new institutions pop up around the US which drove more students to seats since education became more available, etc etc. Now the boomers are starting to see these bookworms come out of college making their trade wages if not more while they get to work in a climate controlled office, not have to be under hazardous work sites, etc and they begin to wonder if the trades are really the right thing to do for their kids. They begin to push college on them. This narrative of \u201cgo to college, you don\u2019t want to work with your hands\u201d will be pushed across the US for years, essentially demonizing the trades. A once respectable profession is now associated with the low class and low IQ. Salaries for employees with bachelor's starts to accelerate and at this point don\u2019t even need to have a relevant degree for your position, the fact that you have one is the key. \n\n**The value of the degree bursts - 2009 - 2019**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o77tb20hera81.png?width=837&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45fce13860e2e184f2dc453c0102b4c4192d2921\n\n2009, again I won\u2019t go into a history lesson but if you were alive during this period you know that those who lost their jobs in the 2008 financial crisis went back to school to either get their BS or their MS. This on top of the already accelerating college enrollment, plus the now crippled US economy bursts the value of the degree. The BS is as common as a Dunkin Donuts in Massachusetts or a -40% in an ARK fund. Salaries stagnate or decrease, inflation increases, college costs increase, it\u2019s a mess for the undergraduate bag holders. \n\n**The Covid Catalyst - 2019-2022**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om0wpjomera81.png?width=1070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeb5ac92a3dbb0984656f69ff04929322810dbc8\n\n2021, ONCE AGAIN, I will not go into a history lesson because we were all there. Covid happens, everyones locked down, colleges go remote, tuition remains the same. What the fuck is the point of college? You can\u2019t party, you can\u2019t afford it and even if you can your paying a house downpayment to watch youtube videos of your professor and take tests via Zoom, even if you do decide to go to zoom university when you get out you\u2019re going to be using your diploma as rolling paper before you go to your shift at Wendy\u2019s. There\u2019s just no point, and we can see it in the numbers. The trades are becoming more necessary, while BS salaries are flat/decreasing trade wages are increasing at rates that make a BS holder look retarded. \n\n**The Catalyst for Reversal - 2022-2026**\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrxpgtvvera81.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d63888c88a5394af812e9ac158d5c26aca3f89f3\n\nThis is where i\u2019m going to get speculative. I believe we will keep trending downward in awarded BS degrees. It currently makes no sense for a HS graduate to consider college(minus a few degrees) when trades are paying much more and tuition is so high. HS graduates will trend towards the trades, maybe get some vocational trading, and start life off with a good salary and no debt. Already better off than a BS holder. Even though BS salaries flattened during the college boom, in a lot of industries the needs were never fulfilled. Now that potential college students are going away from college, those needs will never be met. Employers were getting away with very low salaries due to supply and demand of BS holders, but I don\u2019t think the supply was THAT far away from the intersection point to demand that low of salaries. I believe that with tuition and loan costs going so absurdly high, college graduates became less confident in themselves and wanted to start paying them off asap so rather than negotiate they accepted the first offer given. This going on a yearly basis accelerated the deflation of the college degree. Between 2021-2022, the \u201cBig Resignation\u201d occurred bringing that confidence back to the BS holders. Between 2022-2026, the supply and demand curve for the BS degree will go far below the intersection point. Salaries will explode, and I mean EXPLODE in the already exploding fields like Computer Science, IT, Medicine, Nursing, Healthcare, etc and explode to a lesser degree in the other sectors. But finally we are at the point of this post, and i\u2019m talking about Computer Science, IT, Medicine, Nursing, Healthcare salaries exploding so high that it will cause another bubble like the dot com bubble. \n\n**The Next Bubble - 2022-2026**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1emioo3vera81.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65d00470f3dffdf375f65e572a6bd44cf0f6262\n\nFor obvious reasons, the effect of Covid on tall these professions will not slow down their accelerated need in our society. It will be around forever, hospitals will be exceptionally flooded periodicity because they are normally flooded due to their already lack of employees. Technology will continue to be the back bone of the US and their need is accelerating just as fast as medical. Starting salaries will increase by 15-20% every year. In both medicine and tech, people will job hop every year to take advantage, which will artificially increase salaries of said employees by getting them to hopefully stay. Competitors will take on the annual increase on top of the artificially increased salary and job hop again, and you now have the first salary bubble ever recorded. You apes who have GME shares, you\u2019re going to wish you had a piece of paper saying you went to school to learn about peoples genitalia or actual rocket ships because this is going to be a squeeze in a form we have never seen. I\u2019m a SWE with 2.5yrs of experience, I get calls on a daily basis and i\u2019m a fucking shit developer. I WFH and do MAYBE 4hrs of work a day and get paid 95k a year. I\u2019ve been at my job for 6months and have started taking interviews so I can jump to 125k when I hit 1yr(I know my current company won\u2019t be able to match that). I also think Covid has pumped a fuck ton of money into Pharma and their labs will also be apart of this bubble. Bio, BioTech, BioStats will all become apart of the wanted. Do you think these big pharma companies are going to let 2019-2022 be a quick bubble in their balance sheet? Um no, they are going to want the same acceleration in revenue they saw during covid in the 2022-2026 time frame. How do they do that? The google strategy, throw a fuck ton of money at the wall and go with what sticks. The bio group was apart of the ones who were artificially suppressed in terms of salary but now they will watch their salaries explode. Big pharma needs to act quick to figure out how to invest their vax money to get covid like returns. Everyone will make a ton of money from 2022-2026 until it implodes in 2026-2027. Big Pharma won\u2019t be able to legitimately maintain current returns, hospitals won\u2019t be able to afford their staff, companies won\u2019t be able to maintain their software with everyone leaving every year and their sky high comp\u2026 The biggest bubble since the dotcom bubble will then burst. The next generation goes into trades and the cycle continues.\n\nPositions: A BS in Mathematics and Computer Science,  SOXL Shares.",

This is for growth stocks and blue chip stocks.  APPL up 1.68 % and plus 2 % shares borrowed today. same with google and facebook. Even more dramatic on growth stocks: Draftkings up 3% yet plus 7% shares borrowed. GME is neutral but plus 6% shares borrowed. These are all higher than normal for the past few weeks on a green day.

    "selftext": "If algos treat GME and AMC the same, that demonstrates where Wall St's head is at. AMC's enterprise value is more than 2.5x GME, but GME has way better prospects and financial health. Wall St is wrong on GME again because they're not hedged appropriately for its long term business potential. \n\nThey think the groupthink of apes is a bigger factor behind what moves GME from this point forward as though the market is just influenced by ape behavior rather than business building or destruction. They ignore the biggest factor behind the greatest short squeeze in history: Ryan Cohen.\n\nThis is not about a squeeze to infinity, but there's real potential for this thing to compound like Tesla from here. Consider that the gaming and metaverse industries grow faster and have more margin/cash flow potential than autos, insurance, or renewables. Ryan Cohen is not just rejuvenating a retailer. \n\nRyan is building a tech giant. He's poaching from tech giants. He achieved the balance sheet ratios of a tech giant during the squeezes. He has the strategic vision, focus, skin in the game, and conservative financial approach of a tech giant founder. He *is* a tech founder/billionaire (Chewy). Current tech giants have physical footprints the same size as GameStop or larger. Ryan knows what the potential is, which is why he hasn't sold a single share despite being up 2,135% as of today's close.\n\nPower comes from strategic position. GameStop is not in a powerful position, but Ryan took on this project because he saw the necessary elements and a path to achieve a powerful position. Since then he's been working his ass off for shareholders with this as his sole focus.\n\nYou didn't see much tangible progress, because the first year was the secretive, big-picture stage. He has promised the market nothing and he will easily over deliver this year. None of this is new information, but it is missing from any Wall St take on GME. They're too busy laughing at apes a year later.\n\nThe downside is also limited. There's\nlittle debt and lots of cash. Revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow are all rising underneath the moon potential with Ryan Cohen. No accounting gimmicks, very little share based compensation, and a tiny enterprise value make a solid platform for our rocket, too. Your move, Wall St.\n\nTL;DR: I like the stock.",

    "title": "Nokia $NOK is staying undervalued and market makers are currently battering to kill 21st of Jan call options",
    "selftext": "On Tuesday 11th of Jan 2022, Nokia gave a positive profit warning and price jumped in Europe to 5.769 EUR (6.604 USD). Then started a heavy and systematic battering by market makers and the stock price is now close to $6.00.\n\nOne might wonder why? Well, the max pain level for Friday is $6.00 (level where bankers make most of the money). However more importantly the level on 21st of Jan is $5.00 and there are over **$1 billion** worth of ape money to be burned as those calls were opened during the meme hype in Jan 2021. Every cent closer to $5.00 makes more money to banks.\n\nWhy was $NOK part of the four main meme stocks? (BANG = BB, AMC, Nokia and GME)The reason is that Keith Gill alias u/deepfuckingvalue saw it as a potentially undervalued stock ([pic of his notebook in WSJ article](https://ibb.co/j6FFqG6)). He truly is a value investor and the hype was a consequence of huge amount of degenerates following him. Many stocks made a short squeeze but for Nokia it was more like a gamma squeeze and actually returning to a reasonable valuation level. Price doubled in one day with massive 1.2 billion volume (share count high but market value low compared to peers in telecom sector).\n\nSo, the share price for $NOK was around $4.00 last year January and now it's over $6.00. It's fair to say that DFV was right. Nokia has been making a great turnaround and future looks bright.\n\nMore or less this post is just a heads up for all value investors as the stock is currently battered and sold in my opinion with discounted price (Naked shorts based shares dumped to the market?). Make your own DD and buy if you see the potential (I'm not a financial advisor).\n\nMeanwhile it seems clear that market makers will maximize their profit and make some of you poor (personally I don't have any of those options but I feel you). Long-term investors will most likely focus on 3rd of Feb earnings report when Nokia will likely announce their plan to revive dividends and give the future outlook. Company has a huge net cash, strong cashflow, second to none products in the industry and it's main competitor Chinese Huawei is suffering from US ban so despite of the short term headwinds caused by market manipulation the future seems promising.",

    "selftext": "Why you should listen to me : Like most of you, I\u2019ve been contemplating the macroeconomic implications of our current interest rate environment. And, hopefully like most of you, I\u2019ve come to realize that I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about\n\nI\u2019ll try to use lots of pictures. We\u2019re currently in the most interest rate negative environment we\u2019ve had in awhile\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qges097d9pb81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32f86d0000a8e8f858d60f4487b7bf5b8dbfbe3a\n\nNegative interest rates are funny, you know when you use forbidden corn and you get paid to take out a loan everyone wants to call it a ponzi, but in traditional finance we just call it rich people collateralizing their assets to take out loans against them to defer tax payments as long as possible (banks then use these collateralized assets to lend to anyone wanting leverage or to borrow for a short, just like in forbidden corn land).\n\nThis has important TINA implications because it means that it continues to make even more sense for rich people to stake their assets as collateral at banks, and it also makes sense for banks to be buying convertible debt whereby they get shares of companies if the share price goes above X price. Banks are forced to basically be buying call options on growth stonks\n\nAnyways when we\u2019re talking about interest rates it\u2019s important to remember that money has a time element attached to it. In general the lower the interest rate, the more valuable money farther out in time is. To calculate this, we use discounted cash flow (I promise this is the only time I\u2019ll utter these words), check out this table\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ly22r4g9pb81.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2002493603957f0ec08d25b3b3b9cf50f4e6ce14\n\nEDIT : u/darthboof provided some comments below on how i could improve the table. The \"growth\" value I'm assuming is that in year 5 it gets all of the cash flows, adjusted for inflation, that the value stock did but that growth gets it all in year 5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[EDIT number 2 the last table had miscalc i entered wrong value, if inflation = interest it doesn't matter when u get ur money, if inflation \\&gt; interest then u want ur money as late as possible](https://preview.redd.it/oq7hek4bwqb81.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e395556addf89027937782810ccd04ee3c8576f)\n\nYou can see if real rates are negative (meaning that inflation &gt; risk free rate), then it's better for u to get ur cash farther out in time\n\nFor markets what matters is the rate of change these things are moving in (so like, first derivative) which begs the question\n\nWhy the fuck is everyone selling ARK growth stonks when the rate of change of interest rate environment has been increasingly more and more negative ?\n\nI honestly think people are putting themselves off sides here and that the ARK trade is going to reverse soon as it dawns on people that 1) we\u2019re going to be in a negative real rate environment for awhile 2) that everyone is way way way offsides\n\nHow do we play this ?\n\nWhat follows is generally complete nonsense and probably wrong for a bunch of reasons, but I had to figure out which ARK calls I want to buy so here we go\n\nSo I\u2019ve been selling puts on GME for months fairly profitably, up until maybe the last 2 months when I have been getting completely ran over and forced to take delivery every single time I sell a put on a dip. Anecdotally, I know call sellers who bought into GME at 15 and who have similarly been making money selling calls against shares for months. This dynamic can lead to volatility suppression at some points in the volatility surface which theoretically mean some calls should be good \u201cvalue\u201d.\n\nI imagine some people who hold individual ARK names that are deep in profit are similarly selling calls, or if they are particularly bullish on a single name selling puts etc = vol cheap on the front end, so buy it\n\nHere\u2019s a chart with different tickers, strikes, and IV calculated from ETRADE for 1,2,3,4 week tenors. Note all our brokers calculate IV poorly so this chart is literally crime but tbh I just wanna throw darts so who gives a fuck give it a look and pick ur poison\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pph8pwyx9pb81.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90ab124ce98057b5ad5c931a7618138d75650867\n\nThis chart looks like shit but it\u2019s fitting because it\u2019s a complete crime, anyways to me it looks like the curve is too suppressed on the front end for TSLA and SPOT so that's what I'm buying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22l19jc6apb81.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a8c2a971045170acf2292c4889c2f31b4ef256\n\nMy plan for now is to blow 6k to 9k every week on short dated calls, I will be changing my methodology from this iv suppression shit tho coz this is a pretty bad way to do this but w/e\n\nEDIT : took profits, keeping 1 spot contract running\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tl8yvv6kvpb81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cb5d1fb4e3415fe79c27a79dd6ad14d933c7ecf\n\nEDIT took profits",

These observations by themselves are not consistent with a gamma squeeze.**\u201d\n- Robert Rasamny taking over as CCO of Melvin Capital ahead of the buy button being disabled is evidence that points to Gary Cohn\u2019s SPAC as having quietly acquired Melvin and their liabilities\n\n\n### February 23rd, 2021\nThe SEC announced a $9.2mil whistleblower award for a DOJ-related tip involving either an NPA or DPA (non/deferred prosecution agreements)\n- This took place a few days after Archegos and Ark holdings began to sell off\n- And one day before Greensill being frozen\n- GME begins rising on this day for 2nd time after \u201csneeze\u201d\n- Reports Credit Suisse could be impacted by DOJ scrutiny of DPA breaches (supposedly \u201ccommon\u201d in libor rigging)\n\nSources: [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-31), [FinNews - December 28th, 2021](https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/49397-credit-suisse-romeo-cerutti-litigation-legal-provisions)\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nThis is getting long so let me cut to the chase - what we\u2019ve been witnessing is the breakdown of a [securitization](https://images.app.goo.gl/fUbNBn1PMWbG14Gg8) process. \n\nThe breakdown began during the first quarter of 2020 when CLO managers pulled their money from Greensill after realizing the pandemic would bankrupt many companies.  This created an arbitrage opportunity for Archegos who  invested in the LCDX basket (through Greensill notes) hoping to *make* money off companies going bankrupt.  Archegos extracted incredible leverage from these concentrated short positions and then re-invested the capital in Ark Invest\u2019s portfolio alongside SoftBank.\n\nWhat these investment decisions ultimately resulted in was a historical setup to keen observers like Anchorage, King Street and Jefferies Group who knew if any one of the companies in the LCDX basket succeeded then whomever was being propped up by leverage from concentrated shorts would be negatively impacted (Ark Invest\u2019s portfolio).  \n\nWhen Europcar squeezed on January 13th, 2021 it not only demonstrated the  vulnerability of Loan-only Credit Default Swaps (LCDS) to restructuring but also signaled to those naked shorting the LCDX basket that they would need to find creative ways to buy back shares they would most likely never receive during bankruptcy auctions - this is what leads me to believe the January \u201csneeze\u201d was an event manufactured by SPAC bag holders like Gary Cohn, Securities Lenders  like Steve Cohen, Market Makers like Ken Griffin and former Clearinghouse chairman Jeffrey Sprecher.  ***Why else would they purchase short-dated call options ahead of the buy button being disabled?***.  Even Elon Musk, who many thought was supporting GME while tweeting at the end of January, seems to have actually just been playing a role in the massive *Robinhood Rug Pull* knowing his company could be one of the most adversely impacted by the rise of GameStop.\n\nThe DTCC fallout from the Europcar auction (and \u201cmeme stock\u201d margin calls) seems to have also enveloped Anchorage Capital whose Q2 filings showed surprise puts in GME ahead of their removal from the NSCC.  Check out these rules straight from the NSCC handbook:\n\n&gt; \u201cEach Member shall be obligated to the Corporation for the entire amount of any loss or liability incurred by the Corporation arising out of or relating to any Defaulting Member Event with respect to such Member. To the extent that such loss or liability is not satisfied pursuant to Section 3 of this Rule 4, the Corporation shall apply a Corporate Contribution thereto and charge the remaining amount of such loss or liability ratably to other Members, as further provided below.\u201d - [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf)\n\nWhile essentially all facets of finance appear to have been involved in this breakdown there are two practices in particular that appear to have been at the very top of the funnel:\n- Trade Credit (Hedge fund practice of firms like Eddie Lampert\u2019s ESL Investments who deal in Capital Structure Arbitrage)\n- Trade Credit Insurance (This is the role that Greensill was purporting to play while issuing Credit-linked Notes through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs))\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing in *Trade Credit* (essentially white collar payday loans) it makes sense that you\u2019d also purchase *Trade Credit Insurance*.  And if you were a Trade Creditor and your Trade Credit Insurer collapsed it also makes sense that a trading pattern would arise following the typical 30, 60, 90 and 120 day repayment schedules associated with Trade Credit policies.\n\n**Go look at the GME chart and count out these (30, 60, 90, and 120 day) increments of time from January 21st, 2021 onward.**\n\nFurther evidence of GME having been impacted by Trade Credit can be observed in one of Ryan Cohen\u2019s [tweets](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1400492465442811904?s=21).  Remember the \ud83d\udc80 next to the picture of Sears?  Turns out the OTC Markets website uses a skull and crossbones icon to denote \u201cCaveat Emptor\u201d (\u201cbuyer beware\u201d) stocks like Sears (SHLDQ).  These are the same stocks that recently became limited to liquidation trades only due to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 [amendments](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-212).  Remember the recently departed SEC commissioners?  They were in opposition to these amendments [specifically](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-roisman-falling-further-back-121321).\n\nThe SEC has now moved on new regulations for SPACs, Swaps, Securities Lending and the Fed is now administering the LIBOR-replacement benchmark interest rate SOFR instead of Jeffrey Sprecher\u2019s Intercontinental Exchange - the company he started started in 2000 and just [stepped down](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/nyse-shakes-up-leadership-as-president-cunningham-steps-down) as chair of on December 6th, 2021.  Can\u2019t wait to hear what the DOJ has to say. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs of [April 23rd, 2021](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ubs-takes-surprise-774-million-archegos-hit-11619501547) Credit Suisse and Nomura reported still having 3% exposure to Archegos.  Given Archegos\u2019 usage of 2-year non-cancelable bullet swaps I have no reason to believe either bank has closed their short positions and am very interested in seeing what happens over the next few weeks (expiration of bullet swaps?!).\n\nThe beauty of this thing is even if no MOASS, and the naked exposure cultivated by Archegos has been sufficiently hedged, GameStop is now debt free with best-in-class talent, leadership and undeniably massive market opportunities ahead of it. \n\n\u2014\n\nJust a Retail Investor, not a financial advisor.",

    "selftext": "Alright autists, this post is only for those of you who were around for the crash in Feb/March 2020. The rest of you can go bag hold more RBLX and GME shares.\n\nSo one of the big warning signs of a massive crash is a string of hindenburg omen, we had it right prior to the crash in Feb/March of 2020. Again, this is not the a definitive warning, as it has given many false positives such as in March 2021, and Nov 2020 Aug 2020, and May 2020. But there is more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ad5qq4x6sob81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07098e28cc6c5944d7dde719b2d959e29001dd9e\n\nAnother thing to look at is breath of the market. We know that the breadth of the market is horrible, with something like 40% of NASDAQ down 50% for 2021. The entire stock market is held up by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. The only times breadth was this terrible  was in 2000, Nov 2018, Feb 2020 and now in Jan 2022.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xs6q6t8ptob81.png?width=1112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cefe6ce2eb7e5d86f3b03fb7c6771756706181bb\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the VIX. In Feb 2020, you had a falling wedge in the VIX followed by a breakout before spiking to close to 80 in March.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf9wu82ouob81.png?width=2439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6569ba7c5cbeab5a8a138a75d329097cb67aaad\n\nA similar setup is happening today. Then there is the narrative, the market kept ignoring Covid which was baffling institutional investors going into Feb 2020, despite the rapid spread and the original variant having something like a 2-3% mortality rate. The same thing is happening today. The Fed signaled it was going to end QE and hike rates, but the market largely shrugged it off for a full month. Meanwhile China, the second largest economy where 1/3 of GDP is dependent on housing construction is rolling over and Russia is trying to invade Ukraine (which will send oil to $100+). Investors are ignoring all of this information.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqs98vnxuob81.png?width=2448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6b43b410c4a24e255a92c0f82fe2b538f241dfe\n\nAll of this is pointing towards a massive crash in the next couple of months. but you may counter, the fed won't let markets crash. If it tanks 10%, the fed will cave and give up on rate hikes and will start QE again and pump this market up like its 2020 again. The problem with this argument is that it makes a large assumption that the rise in stock market shares are driven by the fed, when there is a strong argument that it is in fact driven by the rise of passive investing (look into Mike Green if you want more analysis) on this and as a result is resembling a fractal that goes up in an exponential manner, with crazy deep flash crashes in between. This means it could suddenly crash 50% in 2 weeks and there would be nothing to stop it, because it is possible fed QE just creates bank reserves (which does nothing, read Jeff-Snider and Eurodollar University) and the only role the fed plays is in confidence in the market, and it can easily be destroyed like in March 2020, when the market crashed 15%, the fed then dropped rates to 0% and the market proceeded to crash more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmf51uavvob81.png?width=2011&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21669f7c8c1cf42d7abe7b2a63d8f0998defd804\n\nTLDR: I got Feb/March VIX 30-60 calls.",

    "title": "Unpopular opinion : No crash in the near term",
    "selftext": "You are only going to be getting missed opportunities  waiting for your hypothetical dooms day. Yet again... \n\nDisclaimer:  I am but a retard, you will find plenty of spelling mistakes. This should tell you that I am to dumb to be a financial advisor, this is certainly not.\n\n Edit: I suggest you to read the low key newer comments after the edit.  I also encourage you to comment.\n\nAs one of the retards who commented bellow says : \n\u201cMore money has been lost waiting for a crash then lost in any crash\u201d \nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n *often in the market for every reaction there is an over reaction*\n\nThe world feels uncertain? Perhaps the only difference between the reality of tragedy in life today compared to  20 years ago is how fast news travels.  the power of media outside of conventional new of the last 50 years has been drastic. These sources range from podcast to social media, and soon a mataverse. The world has always been in a constant state of conflicts from international to domestic affairs. Not all events lead to crashes, some may even give rise to HUGE  opportunities.  The only significant difference this time is the tragedy of COVID and its aftermath. Whos to say the aftermath is negative for the market specifically.  In fact  i see technological advances from the mistakes learned in this b.s we all got caught on in, thus paving the way for more market opportunities. \n\nHike increase was known ; Hike increases will be less impactful then previously thought . Theres a difference between the reaction  of the number itself  and the actual impact of that number. The number was slightly higher then estimated followed by an overaction. Once they realize the impact isn't as bad because feds will continue to print and people will continue to afford, theyll soon talk about how stable the rates are. \n\nMidterms: every midterm election is a moment of great uncertainty, markets use that as an excuse. Yet every president needs  his last  two years  after midterms to have better economic poll numbers. And if they don't the market will rally behind the next president. They will try everything they can to pass spending bills, first its a fat one, once it doesn't get through, like a brisket they trim it down to the perfect fat amount to tickle both parties. Once a new president is elected the idea of a great economic run based on b.s promises runs the market again...it also depends who actually keeps their promise.\n\n\nOmicron and other variants  :  People are catching  on. The reaction will be less impactful overtime. COVID allthough real and unfortunate,  like many other previous pandemics  will soon be ineffective for the short side. In fact  pharma tech stocks  will benefit from talking about new progress made in preventing future pandemics, technology etc. \n\n\nSupply chain : it has been ALLOT  better in terms of ports. The hard part has certainly been fixing the labour demand. Without much immigration it becomes hard. These days it pays to stay home plus the mental stress of covid has caused an even deeper desire to stay home. As long as it pays to stay home  markets will be fine, because companies will keep making money from cash been poured to  stay at home dads. The hike increasing pushes people to get back to work and stop sitting on their ass, as social welfare won't cut it.  Hike increases also increases inflation then causes assets value to go up.\n\nTech will rocket ,5g, BIG DATA,  metaverse, the next 50 years we will be literally living on Mars. \n\nAs for AMC and GME ;  we know some have a negative reaction to those two ticker symbols. Perhaps because they have had *missed opportunities* no pun intended or perhaps they wanna move on. The though is the following; You and I most likely learned about WSB because of first GME and then AMC. They  are also the ones with the most evident volume and catch on with main steam media.\n\nGME/AMC will rocket again as they are too lucrative for media to stop talking about. If AMC was the second most searched topic it means hundreds of thousand of clicks meaning $$$$. Hedge funds are in it as well not only on the short side, its side gambling money for them by now.",

    "title": "White Gold Rush: Lithium America\u2019s Corp (LAC)",
    "selftext": "Currently those commies in China control 80% of the worlds Lithium supply. Well, Uncle Sam wants to take this back and there is one business with the American flag at their back which will be doing this $LAC. \n\nLAC have exclusive mining rights to Nevada Thacker\u2019s Pass, the second largest Lithium reserve in the world &amp;amp; the largest in North America. \n\nAs a base start for your intro to LAC there is a great interview recently with the CEO Jonathan Edwards here: The market for lithium: A metal miner with an out of this world valuation (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html) don\u2019t let the alarmist headline throw you, the CEO handles the value question straight out of the gate. \n\nOkay, so you haven\u2019t watched the video and instead just googled LAC seen it\u2019s up a bunch and think, meh this isn\u2019t for me, well, let\u2019s look at the catalysts that are coming up: \n\nCatalysts:\n\nThacker Pass approval, the judge just denied the appeal to stop construction. Ground is being broken people! Whilst this isn\u2019t the final judgement, it is a great step in the right direction; two of the attorney\u2019s for those trying to stop the mine just quit. Final judgement is in March and I expect the price to keep climbing ahead of the inevitable approval. \n\nUSA USA USA! It has political desire to take back lithium production from the measly 1% it currently gets itself and is subsiding hugely lithium production at home - see BBB, or whatever they replace it with &amp;amp; other legislation. The USA won\u2019t allow a major ingredient in industry to be at the hands of the CCP and potential tariffs. LAC is going to be the key USA based supplier of this &amp;amp; all other based innovations/products that come from lithium. This will be reflected in legislation, if they can every agree to write and vote on any. \n\nLithium prices are rising exponentially - Google Lithium prices - and are much needed in the clean tech revolution; EV, battery etc. \n\nLAC has just received multiple price upgrades and has a 80-90% buy rating by analysts. \n\nRecently approved acquisition to a further mine, taking total to 3. \n\nPotential partners including Ford, GM and TSLA - the CEO JE states, we are in numerous talks with people regarding potential partners and are under NDA. TSLA ain\u2019t far away from this mine\u2026 just saying. \n\nElsewhere: \n\nLook, we all have picked a sports, I mean Car team, whether you are Ford or TSLA or GM or Lucid or are a GME ape who thinks they will make EV cars soon as well, every man and his dog is scrambling to build as many EV\u2019s as possible, ice cars will be out of production by 2030. They will all require huge lithium to get through the EV arms race. In a world at war, the arms dealers get rich. \n\nThere is a less visible battery race going on this needs lots of lithium. \n\nJust signed off on another mine taking their total to 3. \n\nJonathan Evan\u2019s is a rockstar CEO. \n\nYour complaints: \n\nAnother business with no revenue!? Yes, but by the time they are making loads of revenue the share price will be a lot higher. Speculate to accumulate my regarded brothers. \n\nThose tribes &amp;amp; eco warriors are against it; well yes and no, a lot of the tribes peeps are for the mine due to the prosperity &amp;amp; jobs it will bring. In terms of climate, the impact study shows this will be a huge net positive in the fight against climate change. Biden has committed to fighting climate change at COP26. It hot outside and we got to stop it. \n\nInflation! Rate rises! This can be offset by the rise in demand and price of lithium + the subsidies by the USA gov for lithium production. LAC also has an excellent balance sheet to weather this. \n\nMy position: \n\nI am in for $30K with an avg 3x leverage at $29 per share. \nI plan to run up this up to it hitting $45 and take profit. Then reinvest everything in straight shares. I\u2019m in Australia, so I don\u2019t have the fun of options. I can only just leverage myself to the tits. I am sure people can come up with far more regarded plays that will make bank! Also, I\u2019m in Australia, we make a lot of money from digging shit out of the ground. \n\nTL;DR: LAC is going to make lithium, lithium make EV go brrrrr. USA need to take lithium away from China. LAC make USA go purrr. Lithium is white gold. \n\n(Wrote this on the mobile because couldn\u2019t be bothered to open the laptop.)\n\nNot financial advice. I have been wrong often in the past. Do your own googling.\n\nEdit: just to be clear, the main point here is that the USA needs to get Lithium out of the ground in its own back yard. The USA is not trying to make money from LAC directly (which is a Canadian based company) rather it needs LAC to supply all it\u2019s own industry\u2019s with Lithium. LAC\u2019s origins isn\u2019t important, but if it was Canada and China hate each other; see the whole Huawei thing. Canada and USA are staunch brothers obvs. LAC giveth the USA lithium.\n\nEdit 2: clarifying American lithium backing: \n\nAs responded in thread source SA: \n\n\u201cThe Government Wants Lithium\n\nLooking past the trendy word crafting, we can see the Biden administration is behind lithium much like the Trump administration was. Looking at the December 13th, 2021 statement we see the following highlights:\n\n1. \"The Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) will establish a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation focused on deploying EV infrastructure.\"\n\n2. $5 billion in funding for a national charging network.\n\n3. $2.5 billion in additional charger funding.\n\n4. Target of 50% EV penetration by 2030.\n\n5. DOT will publish standards for EV chargers.\n\n6. \"Increase domestic manufacturing of EV batteries and components and advance environmentally responsible domestic sourcing and recycling of critical minerals.\"\n\n7. \"$17 billion in loan authority in the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to support the domestic battery supply chain. LPO will leverage full statutory authority to finance key strategic areas of development and fill deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will include the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers of advanced technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping, expanding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the United States.\"\n\n8. \"Leverage $13 million in FEMP's Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies grants to unlock an estimated $260 million or more in project investments, including battery storage projects.\"\n\n9. \"Funded two dozen teams to expand sourcing of lithium from geothermal brines and approved a permit for the Nevada-based Thacker Pass lithium mine.\"\n\n10. \"Automakers are also signing contracts that leverage domestic supply, including Ford sourcing lithium from recycled content through Redwood Materials, GM sourcing lithium from geothermal brines in the Salton Sea with Controlled Thermal Resources, and Tesla sourcing lithium from a Piedmont project in North Carolina.\"\n\n11. \"$7 billion in funding to accelerate innovations and facilities across the battery supply chain from battery materials refining, processing and manufacturing to battery manufacturing, including components, to battery recycling and reuse. These investments will support the development of a North American battery supply chain, help expand manufacturing and recycling facilities in the United States and substantially advance the battery recycling through research, development and demonstration projects in collaboration with retailers as well as state and local governments.\"\n\nEdit 3: TSLA link \n\nSee interview Q at 2.30 with CEO: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html\n\nEdit 4: additional information \n\n\nUser lenraleigh left the following comment in the thread below which adds more depth to the DD; big thanks to them for highlighting these additional bits! \n\nComment: \n\nImportant points:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Cauchar\u00ed will be producing in mid 2022.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC just purchased Millennial.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC has been investing in Arena Minerals. Millennial's lithium brine project, Pastos Grandes is immediately adjacent to Arena's Sal de la Puna project. Arena is an exploration company and it makes sense that LAC will want to buy that as well.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC has something like $400m cash on hand. This gives them a tremendous amount of leverage when selecting a partner for Thacker Pass.\n\u2022\t\u2060So you see, LAC is not just Thacker Pass. They aspire to be a \"major\" Lithium producer and have been making very strategic moves. They have Thacker Pass. They have Cauchar\u00ed. They have Pastos Grandes. They will likely have Sal de la Puna. The quality and quantity of Lithium they will likely be producing in a few years is amazing.\n\u2022\t\u2060Problems in Chile and other countries are going to lead to more good new for LAC and other producers in the USA and Argentina.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a long term LAC holder and began accumulating in Feb 2017. LAC has changed my life. I personally scaled out a bit at $18 and will trim a bit around $50 (or whenever it overtakes too much of my portfolio.) IMO we'll see $100+ one day, and I'll still be holding. It's probably not a good stock to \"get rich quick\" on, although, many people do believe it will run up into the 40's over the next several weeks.\n\nFWIW I got lucky and found Joe Lowry's \"Global Lithium\" podcast back in the day. It's the one podcast I listen to and it is gold. LAC's geologist has been on there, and so has the CEO.\n\nEdit 5: \n\nTL;DR (revised courtesy of Professional_Call_41) \n\nLAC is going to $100 this year. With Judge Du Approval in March + DFS + strategic partner + retail/institutional FOMO all in lockstep and in the coming months\u2026 mix in production at CO by year end and it\u2019s a no brainer\u2026 this all WITHOUT considering the structurally short Lithium supply/demand issues that are here to stay and worsening by the day.\n\nIf there\u2019s one companies stock with the right story, management team, deposit, and time in history all lining up for a massive surge, it\u2019s this one.\n\nViva LAC",

    "title": "TIL: One of the most explosive dot com IPOs, LNUX, is a subsidiary of GME",
    "selftext": "While watching the [PBS Frontline documentary, 'Dot Con'](https://youtu.be/TnazfW1T-ks), which takes a look back at the dot com bubble and burst of '99/00, they mentioned a particularly spectacular IPO of a linux company called 'VA Linux' trading under the $LNUX ticker.\n\n[It IPO'd on Dec 9, 1999 at $30 and rose to $320 intraday and closed at $250, a whopping +733%:](https://www.wired.com/1999/12/va-linux-sets-ipo-record/)\n\n&gt;Analysts said [VA Linux](http://www.valinux.com/)'s astounding IPO had less to do with the fundamentals of the company than with the general hoopla among investors about anything remotely tied to the Linux operating system.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"VA Linux only did as well as it did because of the price performance of Red Hat,\" said David Menlow, president of [IPOfinancial.com](http://www.ipofinancial.com/).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The first Linux-related issue to hit the market this year, Red Hat Software has skyrocketed in recent days. The company's stock has risen 1,837 percent since its IPO, making it the best-performing new issue of the year, according to Renaissance Capital.\n\nHow truly incredible to think that at one time, companies like Netscape and Red Hat Linux were leaders in the market.\n\n[It subsequently declined heavily with the dot com crash:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet)\n\n&gt;On December 8, 2000, one year later, after the bursting of the [dot com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_com_bubble), shares traded at $8.49/share.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet#cite_note-14) In January 2001, the stock traded at $7.13/share.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet#cite_note-easycome-2) By December 2002, it was worth just $1.19/share.\n\n[LNUX price 09.09.99 - 09.12.00](https://preview.redd.it/kqp3a3b833c81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708671f7d2d300157563f37539a4a547f5e21b6a)\n\nVA Linux transitioned to VA Software (stock plunges 42% in one day after an earnings warning), moving away from hardware, then to a proprietary version of SourceForge, then 'GeekNet' then through a number of transitions to 'ThinkGeek' which was [eventually acquired by GameStop on June 2, 2015 for $140 million in a bidding competition with Hot Topic of all things...](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/gamestop-outbids-hot-topic-for-thinkgeek-parent-company-purchase/)\n\nHow bizarre, it's really fascinating looking back at the media and headlines surrounding the speculative investing of the euphoric lead up into the end of 1999. You eventually start to see headlines of Greenspan talking about cooling the economy with rate hikes and the translation into severe choppiness in the NASDAQ in particular, with 3-4% and even 14% intraday drawdowns, short lived recoveries, and further selloffs.\n\nAnyhow, I suppose holding GME means also holding a piece of dot com history as well, two decades later \ud83e\udd72Looking forward to what remarkable future it hodls for when it gets acquired by TSLA in 2040.",

    "title": "The \"WSB Friendly\" Ape DD mentality DD pt. 2 (The bears are coming)",
    "selftext": "**(DISCLAIMER: I've had trouble posting this all day so Im leaving out the links here, if you would like to see the links, go to my page for the unedited version).**\n\nHey everyone, oickles here! You may have known me for my Ape mentality DD post a while back. I wanted to give you a quick update on what's been going on since I've written that post and even further analysis on why I think Apes are fukt.\n\n\n#The Breaking Point\n\n\nApes have been reaching breaking points as their beloved stock crumbles before their very eyes. One notable instance is going on with the AMC community where, their [stock-tubers are getting suicidal DMs from apes who threw in entire life savings into the stock hoping for a Moass.(I had to remove the link due to the mod removing it)\n  This isn't a game, people are really reaching their breaking point with meme stocks, what you may see in the next 2 weeks may be huge selloffs. People are throwing everything they have to keep the stock propped up [see here](https://imgur.com/gallery/6PUWI9w).\n\n\nThis concludes that apes and retail in general is running out of ammo. The free money from the stimulus has ran out, life savings, any free money that was for benefits even has ran out and they are truly fukt. Apes have cornered themselves in a fortress of shit and are flinging it also at each other while convincing themselves that RC or DFV will come from the heavens and save them. The stocks cannot keep up it's inflated price and the stock will continue to tumble; it's inevitable and a reality for most apes as they watch their life savings go down the drain.\n\n\n#Gamestop\n\n\nGamecock has been the front-runner for most stock investors, its wild volatile swings have been astounding for swing traders. Recently SS had deleted a user's post for making 6 Million dollars from swing trading the stock stating; \"They didnt want other users to follow his example\". Yeah they want the apes to keep bagholding because that's how you make money? You've been brainwashed into thinking that buying a stock makes you money instead of swing trading it. I'd rather pay 45% taxes on 3 million instead of 30% on 20k. I'm just saying..\n\n\nGamestop as a company is burning cash with no potential room for growth, revenue and a future. [The stock is essentially burning cash from 1.7Bill to 1.5B and dropping](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-gme/gamestop/news/gamestop-nysegme-has-debt-but-no-earnings-should-you-worry-1). The apes would have you believe that the price doesnt matter, the earnings doesnt matter, nothing matters except the DD and this is how you form a cult. You've been gaslighted into losing your money, your hard earned investments and hopes and dreams over a stock that will probably never return to the ATH you sold them for. \n\n\nGamestop doesnt fit in the NFT marketplace and here's why that bullshit pitch is nothing less than copium. Apes with their short termed memory proposed the NFT dividend to expose naked shorting and start the Moass as to what they believe \"we own the float multiple times and a dividend to count each stock would expose the overshorting of the stock\". This fell apart when there was no dividend announced and the Cult leaders had to come up with another tangible lie to keep the Ape's invested. All of a sudden GME is a \"Fundamentals play\" when all before \"Fundamentals don't matter\", \"it's a squeeze play\". I personally asked Gamers how they felt about NFTs and they responded VERY NEGATIVELY \n\nGamestop investors are trying so hard to preach and push NFTs when:\n\n1. NOONE WANTS IT, OUTSIDE OF THE SHITFLINGING APES.\n\n2. NO Developer who would issue an NFT, would ever lose potential profits to a brick and mortar store when they could sell it directly out of their own stores. \n\nThe reason why GME is failing and so hated amoung developers is because, they resell used games and do not pay the companies of the games they resell. [Most of, if not all of the profits goes towards GME and this causes alot of lost revenue.](https://youtu.be/703cX_edBlk). You coukd say that game skins from Call of Duty are NFTs, but noone is going to GameStop to buy COD skins. You can buy the skins straight from Sony store, then buy Cod points and get the skin.\n\n\nEverything is becoming mainstream, NFTs doesn't fit GameStop's narrative and if anything accelerated it's death. You can buy a ps5 from Sony and Amazon or UPS will deliver it, noone needs Gamestop anymore and it's earnings report proves it. Losing 500 Million dollars while increasing in 300 Mill in inventory is not bullish. It means less people are buying and they cannot sell the products they have to compensate. \n\n#FUD, Shills, Bears?\n\nAnything negative about gamestop gets downvoted and noted as \"Paid Shill, Bot and FUD\", so here's what I'm going to do for the apes. Im going to list out some cult signs and debunk some theories about this \"paid shills\".\n\nSigns of a cult:\n\n1. The leader is the ultimate authority (DFV, AA, RC, DD grifters)\n\n\n \"If you\u2019re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you\u2019re probably in a cult.\nCults\u00a0begin with a charismatic leader who claims some supreme knowledge. They may call themselves a prophet, messiah, messenger, or an enlightened teacher. They can also be CEOs, military officials, politicians, and self-help gurus.\"\n\n2. The group suppresses skepticism (FUD, Shill, Bot)\n\n\n If you\u2019re only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you\u2019re probably in a cult.\nCults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult.\n\n\n3. The group delegitimizes former members (If you leave, you're a paperhanded bitch)\n\nIf you can\u2019t think of a legitimate reason for leaving your group, you\u2019re probably in a cult.\nBecause the cult considers itself the ultimate authority on truth, it can\u2019t imagine anybody leaving it with their integrity intact. Thus, it has to perpetuate a false narrative that former members were deceived, proud, immoral, or lazy.\n\n4.The group is paranoid about the outside world (Everyone is in on it. Amazon, SEC, DTCC, Citadel, CIA, FBI)\n\nIf your group insists the end of the world is near, you\u2019re probably in a cult.\nCults position themselves as the sole refuge from an evil outside world that is intent on their destruction. Cults thrive on conspiracy theories, catastrophic thinking, and persecution complexes.\n\n\n5.The group relies on shame cycles (As shown in one of my pictures, the apes need support because noone believes them)\n\nIf you need your group in order to feel worthy, loved, or sufficient, you\u2019re probably in a cult.\nCult leaders trap members in shame cycles by imposing abnormally strict codes of conduct (usually prescriptions about diet, appearance, sex, relationships, media), guilting members for their shortcomings, and then positioning themselves as the unique remedy to the feelings of guilt which they themselves created\n\nI'm going to stop here and post the source of my information: https://medium.com/@zelphontheshelf/10-signs-youre-probably-in-a-cult-1921eb5a3857\n\nFeel free to give it a read.\n\n#Earnings and how to gauge them\n\nGamestop Q4 earnings are good however; we can compare them by a year by year analysis to see what direction the business is headed in: [Here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)\n\nEven with the Ape and stock boost, Gamestop is still a failing company that DFV fairly valued at 20-40 dollars. He never cited a Moass and this is what caused the downfall of most apes.\n\nIt's honestly a shame to see this, you guys could've been a market terror causing short squeezes all over and getting rich. You instead got yourselves and everyone else involved with your Moass propaganda and Everyone can see through your shit. (link removed)\n\nThat being said, the stock will continue to tumble even with the small rips it will have. Call it a bear flag if you must, but this stock is going to 20 fast and once Apes wake up and realize they have been duped, I could honestly see [terrorist acts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s4pswk/at_least_they_get_nfts/) being attempted on DD writers and RC for not delivering the promised Moass.\n\nApes, get out and get some help, reconnect with your loved ones and admit you have a issue. You can rebuild what you've lost, do not wait until it's all gone to try because this will happen [to you](https://www.joshuakennon.com/gt-advanced-technologies-bankruptcy/)\n\nEdit: You can see users like Bigstonkguy that are making a killing from shorting. Shorts are not fucked, Apes are. I believe that Gamestop will see double digitals before a Grand Scale Meltdown.",

    "title": "Meme stocks are shorts",
    "selftext": "Here's the real, non-echo chamber take from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. So many echo chamber-deluded apes spit out all of these qualitative factors to claim that these meme stocks are a buy, e.g. \"NFTS!\" or \"they restructured their leases!\" or \"they have a lot of cash now so they're not going bankrupt!\" This is nonsense - a company doesn't have to go bankrupt for you to lose a massive amount of money.\n\n**Intrinsic Value: about $5 per share:** A company's intrinsic value is the present value of its future cash flows. While the market valuation of a public company can gyrate wildly around this intrinsic value in the short term, history shows us that companies' share prices will always ultimately return to this true fair price. The problem with this \"present value of future cash flows\" calculation is it's too theoretical and subjective to be meaningful, and putting forth projections here would leave me susceptible to all kinds of uneducated retorts. However, earnings multiples are a useful shorthand tool for rough valuation analysis when used in the context of other public companies' similar metrics. \n\nLet's say hypothetically that AMC stock drops about 50%, to $10 per share. This would give AMC a market cap of about $5B, which would put its enterprise value at roughly $14B. Wall street believes that AMC will generate about $435M (consensus) of EBITDA next year. This means that at this hypothetical $10 per share, or $14B of enterprise value, AMC would be trading at 32 times next year's EBITDA. Turns out, that is exactly the same EV/EBITDA multiple that Enphase (ENPH) currently trades at - and Enphase is a phenomenal business with solid IP, a wide moat, market share leadership, and phenomenal earnings power in a super high-growth, underpenetrated market (resi/commercial solar) - all of which are extremely attractive investment features (none of which are encompassed by AMC). I promise you, even at $10 per share (32X EBITDA), AMC would still be far overvalued. AMC's closest publicly traded peer, Cineplex, trades at about 8x 2022 EBITDA (imperfect, I know). \n\nIn reality, AMC is probably worth closer to $5 per share. I say this because just prior to COVID hitting, AMC was hanging out in the $7ish range, and it's a reasonably conservative to assume that the equity is worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID. Why do I say it's worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID? Because I'm assuming the massive shift towards at-home streaming (see NFLX, Disney+, etc. subscriber growth surge) permanently impaired AMC's future attendance by 25% (probably conservative). The $2.5B permanent impairment charge they took against goodwill and intangibles in 2020 provides support for this assumption: that impairment chargewas about 25% of their pre-impairment total asset balance. This is the company secretly admitting the future of their business is 25% more bleak than it was before COVID.\n\nIt's totally fine to be an ape and buy the stock in solidarity with your ape brethren and because you believe there will be a short squeeze, but don't fool yourself into believing you hold the stock based on fundamentals.\n\nOn the topic of that short squeeze - it's not gonna happen, and there is no mass hedgie conspiracy against the apes. I work as an investment analyst at a long/short equity hedge fund and I promise you that the short interest you see on yahoo finance is in fact pretty close to the real number. I have confirmed with multiple major wall street brokers (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc.) that there are plenty of shares available to borrow, and the interest rate is about what i would expect for a stock with roughly 20% short interest.\n\nAnother way to think about the viability of a conspiracy theory like this is to think about what would motivate the alleged conspirers to engage in this type of scheme. In the hedge fund world, everyone is motivated by getting a fat year-end bonus. As an industry, we get paid our year-end bonus when the fund as a whole outperforms its benchmark (for example, benchmark might be the S&amp;P 500). Typically the bonus payment is 20% of excess return... e.g. if if my fund had $1B of assets under management, and we returned 30% last year vs. the S&amp;P's 20% return, our bonus payment would be (30%-20%) x $1B x our 20% take = $20m of bonus pool to be split amongst the investment professionals, back office people, etc. $1B of assets at a single-portfolio manager hedge fund can easily be handled by 5 to 10 total staff, so you can see how the economics on a per-person basis can be quite motivating.\n\nNow, this is a double edged sword, and this is where AMC/GME come into play. There is something called a high water mark. If a hedge fund underperforms their benchmark, they would not get a bonus payment for the year, and they will never get another bonus payment until they recoup that underperformance (and tack on additional outperformance). If it seems hopeless for a fund to ever make up that shortfall, the fund will usually shut down - brain drain is inevitable at this point, as talented investment professionals will jump to another fund where the possibility of a fat bonus is on the table. Now, imagine what being short AMC last year and not exiting prior to year end would do to a fund - the stock rose roughly 13x from beginning to end of the year. Even if that was a hypothetical small 3% of the portfolio, that 3% position losing 1300% would create about a ~40% loss for the fund as a whole. That fund would shut down, guaranteed (e.g. Melvin capital) - no one sticks around at a fund that's down that much - the likelihood of ever getting a year-end bonus again is too slim. The majority of people I know at other funds who were shorting the stock for fundamental reasons prior to the WSB meme stock movement got out long before the big price spike in May - prior to that surge, the stock was already up roughly 5x from the beginning of the year, which is far too large of a loss to stomach for a hedge fund already.\n\n**TLDR:** AMC is \"fundamentally\" worth &lt;$5 per share, and no squeeze is coming.",

    "title": "A $GME Story Part 1: The Three Day Weekend.",
    "selftext": "It was this time a year ago the average Wall Street Better knew who was shilling what and trading plays trying to gain greater advantages thru a collective view of the market in a covid world. WSB knew of the notorious $GME and u/DeepFuckingValue's well detailed economic theories behind the play. I knew he was right and I never watched more than a minute of his material.\n\nHow did I know? I went to a top 10 business university for finance and accounting. My professor and guidance counselor thru the program was a genius and someone who I got to know very well over the years. This man had MBAs on his CFAs to add to his CPAs because his PHDs weren't enough. After my first several office visits I noticed a chart on his wall with a very peculiar pattern so I inquired about it. And boy did his eyes light up. It was his thesis of the perfect squeeze. A squeeze that had over 100% Short interest. A mathematical improbability but not an impossibility due to the relaxed regulations surrounding the practice.\n\nUnfortunately for math shorting more stock than available makes for a paradox of a supply problem. Wall Street Bets and DeepValue were becoming very aware of this mounting issue for the shorts going into January 2021. In the later part of 2020 GME began to shift its momentum from a dying retail resale video game store into a financial timebomb. I knew what I needed to look for to confirm my suspicions that this was going to be in fact a MOASS. This financial tell happened on Jan. 25th.\n\nJan. 25th was after a 3 day weekend to respect our brother MLK jr. much like today. The difference was GME had continued its march higher thru the new year hitting new highs week after week. It just keep putting the shorts further and deeper underwater until someone had to cover hard that afternoon. The stock had risen parabolically in a matter of hours and decayed in an identical fashion. This was an organized event in which the funds short test the supply to understand the cost of covering. It was just unfortunate that there was no supply left as everyone was following DFV's thesis of holding to great success. This was evident in the parabolic price movement just to rest at the same level before the move. This was the white flag of their defeat and I knew my entry and made my move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l11j8q8q1ec81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e116274f2a86adbc2493c0d999b9ca609caf0792\n\nI acquired my 2 meme tickets for the at-the-money strike a month out. I knew shorts were fucked and the diehard attitude of DFV and the apes lead to one in a million scenario of my professors prophecized perfect squeeze. I knew what I was doing or else I wouldn't have thrown a bone at it at all. I knew I didn't need many tickets for the rocket as this would fuel itself and what was most important was to have the tickets period. So I allocated the proper hedge and low and behold what happened in the after hours and premarket was pure extecay as we doubled in price for the next 3 trading days.\n\nThe shorts were done. The war was won. The discussion wasn't who's selling but why should we sell. The theory my professor postulates is one that causes the infinite squeeze mechanic to vacuum the entirety of the stock market world. Any ownership of a short position was a ticket to bankruptcy. The complete economic collapse of our capitalist society was what was at stake here. The forced selling of these overshorted shares was the only way out of this compounding effect.\n\nThis was known and was the exact action taken 3 days later on the 28th of January 2021 when brokerages around the USA stopped the free market. In 3 days this position was worth over 150k and for good reason. After they closed the market? They wouldn't be touched even at market price. Which at that point the stack of cards fell and shorts knew they could sell into zero buying pressure. I had to cancel and understand that the GaME was rigged. Just as my professor said it was.\n\nEvery retail share purchased was one their brokerages had sold them from another owner in their pool of clients and they could no longer acquire them at price as liquidity of the stock was negative and was doubling daily. They knew they were first contact for the buttfucking and had every incentive to force their clients to free up liquidity as they were buying tickets out of the rat race with furosity.\n\nThey had the right to make the position close only and they'll do it again unless there is regulation to prevent the closure of the free market. American's have every right to make the decisions they do with their hard earned money and preventing it as they did was unAmerican. We all vote with our money here and closing a free market is akin to shutting down a voting booth because you didn't like the outcome.\n\nPetitioning your representative to prevent this action in the future is required for success or else they will pull the same action the next time and prevent the true power of the MOASS. Also, you can switch to brokerages that acquire shares and lock them away so others don't play with them.\n\nApes hold strong and heed my cation. This is now a long play. One in which the major players are moving around false shares to each other. It will be a losing game for at least two years from here. What is going on is the purchase of time by the shorts by leveraging and manipulating other positions. Time to get on the right side of this. Time to convince someone else GME isn't still worth it. Don't fight it and accept their discount (they have way more money than you right now because they took your money) and say thank you retard for giving you the time and discount to load up to the tits.\n\nTLDR: Buy shares for a 2 year hold. Accept the falling price as a discount to add to the position. Get a job behind wendy's to fund consistent purchases of GME. If you believe my story above god speed retard I am with you but being calm and consistent are key. Options will be worthless for most investors unless you have the level of understanding that I do.",

    "title": "Gamma squeeze of the century on last year's leaps",
    "selftext": "I know what you\u2019re thinking: Not everything is a short squeeze, these have been beaten to death more than I was by my stepfather.\n\nAll I ask is you give me the chance my wife\u2019s boyfriend wont.\n\nLast year, 2 weeks before the silver \u201csqueeze\u201d, I made a post about First Majestic ($AG) that went largely under the radar until it shot up over 120% in the following 2 weeks.  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxi76i/rise\\_of\\_the\\_silver\\_surfers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxi76i/rise_of_the_silver_surfers/)\n\nI am here to talk about the aftermath.\n\n# If you are lazy and want a 2 min summary, read only the bolded sentences for the TLDR.\n\n# Background and context\n\nSo how did last year's silver \u201csqueeze\u201d occur, and what were the long term effects of the event? Well for one, banks are to silver as hedge funds are to GME. Just at an enormous scale. I am talking David vs Goliath here. When silver shot up to $30 in Jan 2021, banks dumped paper contracts worth millions of ounces onto the market, effectively collapsing demand through artificial excess supply. Not only that, but SLV itself was a setup by the banks from the get go (this will briefly be covered at the end of this post.)\n\nRegardless, long term silver investors saw this as the final break in the silver market. Something they have been waiting decades for to occur. These dinosaurs have been hoarding precious metals non stop before most of you were even born, despite the rampant suppression in the precious metals market by the banks.\n\n**So what do these boomers decide to do after seeing all these events unfold on Jan 28?** **They buy a copious amount of LEAPS on everything from the SLV to miners like First Majestic Silver.** (context: LEAPS are call options typically expiring in a year or longer). These are high leverage long term plays.\n\n**The perfect date? Jan 21 2022, more than a year away from expiry at the time.** Not only does this allow for long term capital gains, but higher silver prices seemed inevitable with the actions the Fed was taking. There was no way this could go tits up.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too much into why or how silver has underperformed over the past 18 months in an environment where even your mom\u2019s OnlyFans subscription is skyrocketing in price.\n\n**What I am here to talk about with you today is the effect these leap options are having now that we are less than 4 trading days from expiry.**\n\n# Investigation\n\n**Open interest indicates the total number of options that are still being held by traders (unsettled).**\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at a mining stock that saw the heaviest trading at the time of the silver squeeze:\n\nFirst Majestic ($AG)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98s6wwutigc81.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23625e345e76c08e3cd7e7cf63189c037293dc90\n\nThese are options that expired last week on Jan 14, 2022 (Snapshot is 3 days before expiry). Taking a look at the open interest, we see there were around 6,000 options being held by traders with about 2200 ending in the money. Something to note is that open interest typically increases each week you get closer to expiry as more traders pile in.\n\nExpiration dates further out typically have less open interest. Jan 28 only had about 2000 in total open interest on Wednesday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zapqklgphgc81.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b853dc71165cb36fc5cb77f4e15c1447606ddcee\n\nHowever, Friday we saw some more activity. Some buffoon decided to purchase over 1600 OTM options on the 13.5-15 strikes. A degenerate or someone with inside info? Time will tell. The cost of these would only have been about $5000 since they are so far OTM. This brought up the open interest to 3786.\n\nThe next week, Feb 4, has almost no open interest with around 800 contracts seen below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inl7o3giigc81.png?width=1698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56026995c37939dad377892c3c4600855d9c5f55\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of telling you any of this? Well if you keep these open interest numbers in mind, we have a reference point when looking at our leaps.\n\n**Let\u2019s take a look at the open interest for those LEAPS we mentioned expiring on Jan 21, 2022:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6kz0fmhigc81.png?width=1330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=724da8a579622b73130aaef54555bea3f39f58ad\n\nWell that can\u2019t be right? There are over 167,500 (at the time of this writeup) contracts still held by traders. That is astronomical compared to the 3800 and 800 being held for the aforementioned expiration dates. **These 167,500 contracts are equivalent to 16.75 MILLION shares when executed**. **This is in the context of a stock whose average daily volume is 3.6 million.**\n\nSo what does this mean? Well about 26,000 of these contracts are currently in or near the money.  For each of these contracts, the seller of the call contract will have to come up with 100 shares. Market makers know this and at this point most sellers already own the shares and are prepared to hand them over come expiration time. That\u2019s 2.6 million shares that are likely already owned.\n\n**But what about the contracts that aren\u2019t in the money? There are 141,000+ contracts with high concentration on the $12, $13, $14, and $15 strikes. These calls are largely unbacked by shares due to Market Makers aiming to be delta neutral (only buying shares if we start approaching the strike price). Since these strikes are a bit out of the money, there has been no reason for MMs to hedge by holding shares.**\n\nBut what if these calls gradually started moving in the money? That is 14,100,000+ shares that market makers would need to obtain if all of these strikes aproach in the money.\n\n**So what would happen if the price of the shares started nearing the $12 mark? Well we see the open interest at the $12 strike is 25,000 contracts. Meaning 2.5 millions shares would need to be bought to hedge against these calls. This is more than HALF the stocks daily volume. What happens when MMs scramble to obtain 2.5 million shares? The price skyrockets, causing a domino effect where the next strike is now ITM (in the money). This process repeats at the next strike, an infinite money machine.**\n\nI\u2019m going to explain this in as simple a way as possible\n\n1. MM hedge according to how big the position and how far out of the money the call is. Hedging just enough to cover the probability of the stock rising. Typically they hedge by buying shares.\n2. As stock price increases and the large volume of calls become closer in the money, the MM\u2019s need to hedge. They need to buy more shares to remain delta neutral.\n3. MM\u2019s buying of shares raises the price, putting more call contracts in the money. The process then repeats; it\u2019s an infinite loop of chasing the stock upwards as MMs continuously attempt to hedge by purchasing stock.\n\nEven simpler: stock price approaches call strike  -&gt; MM forced to buy shares to meet obligations -&gt; price rises -&gt; higher strike calls in the money -&gt; repeat. This only works if there\u2019s a significant amount of open interest like in our scenario.\n\nThis would cause a cascading event where if the $12 strike is reached, 13 would follow next, then 14, then 15 and so on.\n\nFirst Majestic\u2019s volume has recently been waning and the average volume is currently 3.6 million. This means that days to cover would be almost 4.\n\nJust how much is 14,100,000+ shares in this context? A stock float is the total number of shares that are available for public investors to buy and sell. In this case the float is 218 Million. This means that over 6.4% of the TOTAL available shares would need to be obtained (if all strikes are hit) over the course of 4 or fewer days from hesitant shareholders.\n\nFor more context, open interest in leaps bought last year on GME is 138,000 (Jan 21), with the highest concentration at the 950 strike price (52,000 open interest). The chance of a cascading effect is very low for GME as the majority of held options are concentrated at astronomically high strikes. I\u2019m not saying it will or won\u2019t short squeeze, just that there it wouldn\u2019t occur due to a gamma squeeze until consecutive calls with high open interest start being hit.\n\n**For First Majestic, the highest concentration is on the $12 strike which is only 12% higher than the current price. Consecutive strikes also have an even spread of open interest allowing a ramp and domino effect.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xbgqz9digc81.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0db43d874071949fd9e9be0d47dc485870d302\n\nThe cherry on top is that the short of First Majestic is around 8%. This would contribute to the rise of the stock but is not the focal point of this post. The majority of the movement would come from a gamma squeeze as previously covered.\n\n**Why $AG and not $SLV?**\n\nSLV has a similar setup. LEAPS were heavily bought last year and there is still massive open interest for the same leap date (Jan 21). However, this is an extremely large ETF with heavy volume ($400M daily volume), much less volatility (making reaching strike prices nearly impossible), and is primarily manipulated by banks to leech money from boomers as explained here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv\\_is\\_a\\_complete\\_scam\\_its\\_a\\_scalp\\_trade\\_set\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/)\n\n$AG has high options liquidity, enormous open interest from last year\u2019s leap volume, high cascading potential, and a relatively low market cap ($2.75B).\n\n**Positions:**\n\n$50,000 in AG shares\n\n$8000 in AG calls expiring Jan 21, 2022. Strikes are 12, 13, and 13.5.",

The thing people seem to be missing is Tesla the company had a cult around it before the stock had a cult around it. People stan for Tesla and TSLA. No one and I mean no one stans for Gamestop. GME? People non stop shill and stan on that shit, but Gamestop not the Ticker but gamestop does not have a cult fanbase surrounding it. AMC is just a heaping pile of dogshit but the same logic applies. \n\nYou GME retards do not have the same protection TSLA retards have because your company doesn't have a cult, only your ticker does.",

Here\u2019s my two cents: GME may or may not still be a short squeeze play. No one knows 100% or else there wouldn\u2019t be any debate. GME\u2019s business fundamentals are still dicey on paper, but I think you have to look beyond that considering the hiring spree they\u2019ve gone on and the conditions under which those employees are being hired. We don\u2019t know what their plan is, but they seem to be super secretive about something. Lots of ideas, little clarity. \n\n*HERE\u2019S THE DEAL.* whether any of this is anything, there are enough idiots buying shares with every paycheck that EVENTUALLY, they will own the whole company (if we theorize that they don\u2019t already.) This means of enough shit-slinging retards continue to buy and refuse to sell, and they direct register the entire amount of outstanding shares\u2026 if there\u2019s a single phantom share out there\u2026 the first to sell does get to name their price.\n\nMight take years, who knows. I do hypothesize, though, that there has never been this many primals buying one singular stock with the refusal to sell until they\u2019re rich. It\u2019s unprecedented. And I\u2019m on the spectrum. Goodnight.\n\nEdit: yo stop downvoting me, I\u2019m just the messenger!\nEdit 2: shoot this kinda popped off overnight, sorry if I\u2019m not replying to everyone!

I am going to post the funny/top comments posted in March 20-24th of 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;That's it. Fuck you guys. After today, no more day trading, no more gay fucking witches, no more panic, no more fomo, no more hedging with calls, I'm falling for nothing. I don't give a flying fuck if I lose everything but I'm making my move and not fucking budging and watching it till it goes bust.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SPY 4/17 $200p. Fuck you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Biggest lesson of today: If almost the entire sub agrees on something and thinks it\u2019s so obvious then it probably isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I'm not listening to this sub ever again until Monday morning\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This sub is hilarious. People are losing thousands of dollars and blaming it on a witch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Man, I understand the people trying to play a bounce up, that's the market.

Get in the game and get caught in the waves? Wait by the sidelines like a bitch? That\u2019s exactly what I do, wait like a bitch.

Every lay-off means less revenue going into the system and a job that may or may not ever return. Every death will hit a family or a community hard, and will stoke the fear of the financial and economic damage that\u2019s being done.

You don't have to know about the semiconductor industry.\nWe will buy an undervalued company at a low price and sell it at a high price.\nYou only need to invest and earn profits like a fund.\nThis company produces hydrogen fluoride, which is essential for semiconductor production.\nThis means that the higher the purity of hydrogen fluoride, the better the efficiency of semiconductor production. Currently, Japan is known to have the best hydrogen fluoride technology. However, the company succeeded in developing better hydrogen fluoride than Japan. Patents have also been registered. However, the factory has not been built due to opposition from residents. And the company's management is also incompetent. I want to buy this company and sell it to China or other semiconductor companies. This is because if a semiconductor company acquires a hydrogen fluoride company, it can stably receive materials.\nAnd supplying materials to semiconductor companies will affect the semiconductor market. This is because it is less efficient to use products from other companies. That's why this company's products are important. It is already supplying hydrogen fluoride to SK Hynix.\nHowever, it succeeded in developing hydrogen fluoride better than the hydrogen fluoride supplied. \nIf you want to invest, please contact me. I'll explain it in detail.\n\n-----Add\nKorea doesn't support the semiconductor industry.\nLet's sell it to China that supports it.\n\nIf you interested, Give me message.",

And if you believe this Super Bubble has Now Popped, the path of least resistance would be to Go Short and Sell into any Rallies.\n\n[https://youtu.be/9iDiadbrksQ](https://youtu.be/9iDiadbrksQ)",

Might be time to take a break from the main floor of the casino and play the penny slots for a while. \n\nThis is only going to get worse before it gets better. Here are some of my thoughts: \n\n\n1. Interest rates rise, prices fall. Interest rates are poised to rise 4 times this year and the fed can\u2019t afford not to raise rate due to inflation. \n\n2. Inflation. They can\u2019t run the money printer forever and if the fed wants to reign this in, they will need to continue to raise interest rates. \n\n3. Mortgage debt. How many people do you know that bought a house in the past year or 2? This past summer saw an intense buying spree with people offering $100k+ over asking in some areas. Real estate was also propped up by the iBuyers (which are now taking massive losses). Also see point 1.\n\n4. Student debt. Good \u2018ol uncle campaigned on erasing at least some student loans, but has since reversed course and it looks like payments could legitimately resume in May. If those same people that haven\u2019t been paying their student loans have also been buying homes at the top range of allowable DTI levels, then you might see some folks attempting to downsize. Those folks might come to the unflattering realization that they aren\u2019t able to sell their homes for the same ridiculous prices they paid over this past summer. \n\n5. Covid/supply chain issues - nothing new here, but certainly compounds the issues above\n\n6. China / Evergrande - if you haven\u2019t heard of Evergrande, it\u2019s a massive real estate company in China that is defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. This is going to send shockwaves through China and beyond. \n\n7. Other speculative investments - there is another very active community on Reddit that shall not be named that is also seeing massive losses. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Gay bear szn \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b",

    "selftext": "As we all know, Microsoft has just recently acquired Activision for $69 Billion USD.  This new asset now brings to multiple game studios with some HUGE franchise names to the Xbox team.  There is speculation that new games from these franchises will become console exclusive to Xbox.  Here is a current image of their current game studios they now own.  There is also the possibility that many of the new titles from these games could become Day 1 GamePass titles.  \n\nIf we take all of this news into consideration, the only bad news is for Sony fans.  They now have less game choices and less value to their consoles.  GamePass has always been an INSANE value for the price, but now with these new studios, it increased exponentially.  Which leads to my next point.\n\nMicrosoft purchases GameStop\n\nIt would be the next option to take even more money from Sony.  The new GameStop stores could be a combo of their current versions but also include more Windows/Microsoft products, or they could leave them alone for the time being to save on renovation costs.  Now that Microsoft would own a large amount of the actual games sold in a store, they would now be making money on Sony's items also.  They could always just stop selling Sony items, but that would just push the customers someplace else.  This move would mean Microsoft will profit regardless of the customer choosing Xbox or Playstation.  \n\nGamestop has had immense support in recent times.  They got Ryan Cohen to help lead them and they have plans on expanding their offerings.  With Microsoft's backing and other expertise, it could help their future plans become a successful reality.  GameStop has also Missed their Q2 and Q3 earnings which brings this even closer to a possibility.  I'm probably just losing braincells because my tinfoil hat is blocking the 5G, but I think it's the clear path for GME to go to the moon.\n\nThis pushes Sony to do something that can outweigh the positives that Microsoft has.  Sony has also raised their PS5 game prices up to $69.99 where Xbox kept them at $60.  Microsoft offers gamepass, where Sony has nothing to compete.\n\nThe only people to profit are the consumers.",

    "title": "Apes ruined WSB as we know it",
    "selftext": "Oh boy, here it goes\n\nGME squeeze in its early stages was a fantastic event, plenty of people that were already on WSB entered positions at 5-10-20-40 dollars and rode to the top, exiting and realizing gains. It was a great event that became pretty popular, and unfortunately attracted 8 million other user, who knew fuck all about investing and just wanted to make a quick buck by sticking it to the hedgies. Problem with them was that they came in and acted like they were the next Warren Buffet, and anyone who disagreed with them was a dumb shill or didn\u2019t understand the movement\u2122\ufe0f\n\nStock kept dropping further, going all the way down to $40 dollars, before other 8 million users realized that they were too late for an initial squeeze, and decided that the MOASS is yet to come.\n\nWhat was initially a calculated plan in a company that was trading as it was already bankrupt became a platform of firing the \u201cestablishment\u201d and sticking it to the \u201chedgies\u201d\n\nConspiracy theories started spreading, goalposts were being moved, and anyone that disagreed was downvotes into oblivion. There were days when every single post on WSB was about GME. \n\nThat\u2019s fine, no harm in that, if it wasn\u2019t for the mob mentality of literally calling anyone a shill. I was trying to make posts urging new traders to take profits, that trading is a 1 vs 1, not a team game, but my posts were either deleted or I was heavily downvoted.\n\nI started learning about trading on WSB, browsing the sub in 2017. Back then I knew absolutely nothing about options, or trading. This sub was actually a great resource for learning from extremely smart people.\nI know there is a stigma that everyone on WSB is retarded, however, back then it was actually smart people with six or seven digit portfolios just goofing around and making risky but **calculated** bets. \nNowadays, it\u2019s really just a competition in who is dumber and who can write the shittiest DD, than say not a financial advice at the end, and if someone challenges them, they\u2019ll just say \u201c sir this is Wendy\u2019s\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m just a retard\u201d, or \u201cI eat crayons\u201d. \n\nThankfully over the past few months the amount of kids who thought they were some trading gurus for buying a tech stock in March 2020 decreased dramatically, apes moved to another sub that is now ripe with conspiracy theories and constant moving of goalposts. \n\nI just want to highlight one thing, people are tired of apes flooding this sub, this sub was never meant to be a GME circle jerk. But don\u2019t take it from me, take it from ZJZ, a mod who has been with WSB for many years and kept it a sane place. Even he is tired of apes coming here and shilling a brick and mortar store that continues bleeding cash. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oWnUhfT.jpg \n\nI want to be clear, not a single DD written by apes in the past 6 months has been correct, not one has materialized, and not one date they called led to MOASS. Frankly this sub needs more discussion and DD. You might say, dope, so write DD, be the change you want to see, and trust me I do to.\n\nHowever, many times DD gets downvotes or you get called for being a shill for a stock that has any sort of cult following, be it WISH, AMC, GME, or any other popular stock.",

I also put my money where my mouth is, so yes, I am invested in many things I will write up about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finding Value in Underappreciated Markets**\n\n*Tl;Dr: Purchasing gold or silver funds (like GLD or SLV in an online account) could be a fantastic long-term investment.* \n\n \n\nCopper, silver, and gold. Sounds like you're at a Medieval Times Festival!\n\nIn the modern world, everything is an investment. Copper is one of the best leading indicators for the stock market. All 3 metals have industrial uses. Government central banks worldwide hoard and add gold to their reserves.\n\n[This chart link](https://www.macrotrends.net/1437/sp500-to-gold-ratio-chart) is a ratio of dividing the S&amp;P 500 by the price of 1 oz of gold. The ratio rose above 2.5 in October.\n\nOver the past 95 years, the S&amp;P to Gold ratio has risen above 2.5 **only 3 times**. These times include:\n\n^(-The 60's and 70's when gold was forcibly held down by the US government at $35/oz)\n\n^(-The years leading up to the) ^(Dot-Com bubble) ^(in which the S&amp;P was extremely overvalued)\n\n^(-)^(Just this past week) ^(as the S&amp;P again became overvalued (before dropping by 15%))\n\nBasically, this chart tells us that either stock markets are overvalued, or metals are undervalued. **This is a once in 30 year opportunity.**\n\n(At the time of writing, the ratio is 4350/1818 = 2.39)\n\nPurchasing gold and silver funds (like GLD or SLV in an investment account online, instead of hiding actual gold in your home) has the potential to be a fantastic long-term play. I plan to purchase metals until the ratio drops below 2.\n\n*SPX current price: $4350*\n\n*GLD current price: $170*\n\n*SLV current price: $22*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice.",

    "title": "How Congress Traded in 2021 - A deep-dive into the stock trades and investment returns generated by the U.S Congress in 2021",
    "selftext": "In the fall of 2020, [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/31/many-in-us-western-europe-say-their-political-system-needs-major-reform/) released a report which showcased something that we knew all along, deep down. 2/3rd of Americans believe that most politicians are corrupt. This is in stark contrast to Germany where less than 1/3rd feel the same way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xs1hmqb276e81.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ee53c2e04619362e2afad18cd0b286e684189c0\n\nOne of the issues at the forefront of the alleged corruption is the ability of elected representatives to trade stocks. The issue of how to prevent Congress from using insider knowledge to trade has been under discussion for more than a decade now. Even though the Stock Act was passed in 2012, it did very little to combat the issue.\n\nWhat\u2019s hilarious is that lawmakers who violate the Stock Act only face a standard fine of $200 (which also gets waived by Senate and House officials). Here is a report by [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-stock-act-violations-senate-house-trading-2021-9) that highlighted 54 members of Congress that have violated the Stock act in just 2021.\n\nThere is an [ever-growing push](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/19/1073865837/a-push-to-ban-members-of-congress-from-trading-individual-stocks-gains-momentum) to ban members of Congress from trading stocks, but, we do not know if it\u2019s going to be successful this time around. While we wait for the results on the Bill, let\u2019s see how the Representatives have performed in trading last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9wixq4l86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f9cab8cda44b0cce636ac55ef955dc53e45a09d\n\n### Data\n\nAll the data used in this analysis was pulled from [**Capitol Trades**](https://app.capitoltrades.com/trades?page=1&amp;pageSize=20). While I had to manually transcribe some of the data from [eFDsearch](http://efdsearch.senate.gov/) \\[1\\] last time, this time around, Capitol Trades has made my job much easier by capturing almost all the trades made by Congress in 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pbsuv9o476e81.png?width=558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=084905430b7f6c005c346aeb73f23a7e78028bdc\n\nA total of 13,051 transactions were done by Congress Members in 2021 \\[2\\]. The surprising trend here is the split-up of the number of trades between Senators and Representatives. Even though the number of Representatives is only 4x the number of Senators, they made **14 times more trades** than the latter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gppwajwl86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f441794145edefd381dca11fd11a0ead2cb4df\n\n### Analysis\n\nGiven that there are so many trades in the past year, I have split the analysis into two parts. In the first part, we will cover the trades done by Senators and the next part will be on Representatives!\n\nI am focusing mainly on the Buy-side because while there are many many reasons why someone would sell a stock \\[3\\], there is predominantly only one reason to purchase a stock. You expect the stock price to go up!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2f968im86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e34d396783ee399e201a521829f30ac357edce43\n\n**Performance of Senators**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3rge8bd76e81.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e717b723697829bb796d471952b408518137804\n\nA total of \\~$28 MM was invested by the senators in 2021 \\[4\\]. Municipal Security seemed to be the most popular with 31% of the invested amount going towards it. A lot of non-public equity investment was done as well by the Senators. Finally, only around 12% of the invested amount went into publicly listed stock. Interestingly, almost the same amount went into hedge funds!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSenators performed decently last year generating an average return of 9%. But this lagged when compared to the market which returned 15% during the same period. **If you had tried to follow their trades**, your returns would have been a paltry 3.6% compared to the 7.4% you would have generated in the market \\[5\\]. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tushsng76e81.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ebda5110c73bdb2eea46248983c91b3a333b894\n\nEven though overall Senators performed worse than the market, 5 senators did manage to beat SPY with their trading skills \\[6\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kg7140hi76e81.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99001a2afde59b652d08c1fee5d054c3a95c4566\n\nMitch McConnell made 4 trades investing around $32K last year, and made a whopping 34% return beating the index by more than 23%! Gary Charles Peters and Ronald Lee Wyden also managed to beat the index by a respectable 7-8%. Thomas Hawley Tuberville made a total investment of more than $2.4MM last year (\\~14x his annual income) and managed to just beat the market by 0.7%.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, you realize why on average they did not manage to beat the index. There were some truly awful investors in the mix. In a year when SPY return +29%, 3 senators ended up losing more than 50% of their invested capital. (Fun Fact: Patrick Joseph Toomey got into GME when it was trading at $347)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10x3qqmj76e81.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f84a85240d0fb37cec41b6982dde317711a9a85\n\nFinally, let\u2019s come to the best individual stock investments made by the Senators last year. It\u2019s a good mix of manufacturing, semiconductors, and financial services firms. Thomas Hawley Tuberville topped the list by making an investment in Alcoa corp which has returned 144% to date. Wells Fargo seemed to be another popular choice with both Mitch McConnell and Shelly Wellons Capito generating more than 50% returns in 8 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nscou5ik76e81.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e194e0c238b76702f592676d93255ea7e39ca5a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mol156gn86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f152c24241bb93c92b40ecbc3892626950747b24\n\n**Performance of Representatives** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjhtcitn76e81.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23cf3395b7d0ae2e1a321e8f72910a0738bad0c5\n\nA total of 96 Representatives made a whopping $273MM \\[7\\] worth of investments last year. In stark contrast to the Senators, whose stock investments only came to 12% of the total, Representatives had 82% of their investments focused on stocks and stock options.\n\nAs for the returns, Representatives had slightly lesser returns when compared to Senators making an 8% return on average. This is significantly lesser than what the market would have returned during the same period. Following these trades would also not have generated any alpha as you would have only got a 5% return when compared to the 9.6% return generated by the market during the same period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aisrg47q76e81.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=778e9c21a9a0857a138cb6e212d8bc911c0c3de5\n\nBut that\u2019s definitely not the full story. Even though on average Representatives lagged the market, there were some outliers that beat the market and then some.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7i7zeyq76e81.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bad01aa7db3ed5a26e2e70651fd0edca7c0cf56\n\nNancy Pelosi made a 48% return last year investing $970K in NVIDIA in July and $695K in Roblox in March. What\u2019s even more interesting is that these returns are just considering the stocks she bought last year and not including the options returns \\[8\\].\n\nBut on the matter of whether to restrict trading by lawmakers, this was Pelosi\u2019s response\n\n&gt;*We are a free-market economy. They (Congress) should be able to participate in that. -* [*Nancy Pelosi*](https://www.businessinsider.com/we-are-free-market-economy-pelosi-rejects-stock-ban-congress-2021-12)\n\nWell, I would also be a strong proponent of the \u2018free-market economy\u2019 if I was beating the market by more than 30% every year. Other heavy hitters included Suzan Delbene who invested more than $15MM and got a return of 21% and Kim Schrier who invested $1.1MM and made more than 20% in one year \\[9\\].\n\nFinally, one of the most requested items was the industry distribution of the investments. While Tech got the maximum allocation, what was surprising was the average returns generated. The maximum returns were obtained from Finance and Real estate even though 2021 was very good for tech and growth stocks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzrcjgou76e81.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c70c99cd1d130f4ef2c267eb18e6d4fb91f3368\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvi26h5o86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8e83b4778bab020e84886d3859c3180e550c0b5\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are certain limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n**a. Data Quality -** I took the data for this analysis from Capitoltrades.com. While I cross verified a sample of their data for accuracy, I cannot be completely sure that they have captured 100% of the trades reported by Congress since it\u2019s a highly manual process. (See Footnote 1)\n\n**b. Time Delay in Reporting** \\- Congress members are expected to report their trades within 30 days. During my last analysis, I noticed that the median delay in reporting was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. So not all trades that happened in 2021 would be captured in this analysis.\n\n**c. Other Investments -** As you could see from the first chart, only 12% of the investments made by Senators went into publicly listed companies. We do not know how the other investments such as private equity, hedge funds, and municipal bonds performed. So the performance of their overall portfolio might be drastically different than the one we are observing here.\n\n**d. Overall Portfolio -** This brings me to one of the biggest limitations of the analysis. We don\u2019t know how the overall portfolio of the senator looks like. This prevents us from analyzing their trading patterns. For eg., if a Senator reports that he sold apple stock, we don\u2019t have a way to identify whether it was a short-term play or whether he sold it from his existing long-term portfolio for some liquidity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2n19ybo86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d1ed178a69e5ad6b4ffb6ac72789fcef1362b2\n\nI truly hope this is the last year in which I have to do this analysis! Even though Congress did not beat the market in 2021, if you look at the past[ 3 years of data](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nanrlu/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_members_of_the_us/), it shows a very different story. Even setting the starting date of your analysis back by one month to Dec\u201920 would make for a very different result as showcased by [Unusual Whales](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1480656947577860096).\n\nAs I highlighted at the beginning of the article, it\u2019s high time that we bar elected representatives from trading stocks. This would be at least a step in the right direction to gain back the trust that the general public has lost in their representatives. Until then, we can try following their trades to find that all-elusive alpha! [This article](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion/us-congress-can-trade-stocks-or-keep-the-public-trust-not-both) from The Business Times summarized it best for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;US Congress can trade stocks or keep the public trust. Not both\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zgffzdp86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fa646465bc815a9b312da4a526a492ccfbdc14f\n\n**Data used in the analysis:** [Senators](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/senator-trade-analysis-4Lvt8LwulBT1oPOFXCsn0E/live) &amp; [Representatives](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/representative-trade-analysis-2CzMbBANJDSeZL5F66PWYK/live) (It\u2019s a live tracker where I will be updating the trades as frequently as I can. Do check in case you can find a better strategy that I missed out on :))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jb2hgts86e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d573cb8b44f31550a88bd2ab5ba7959eb2bb30b\n\n**More interesting reads** \n\n**Jack Raines:** Jack has a great newsletter where he writes about finance, investing psychology, and his backpacking experience through Europe. The fun thing is you never know what the next article is going to be. Two of my favorites are [Rich in Experiences, Sufficient in Finance](https://www.youngmoney.co/p/b6887a69-37c5-499b-a59a-8328102b2a32)s where he argues that we should be optimizing our lives for experiences instead of money, and [House Money](https://www.youngmoney.co/p/7a99d58b-2a7b-4e69-8b3c-e94f24a3afe8) where he deep-dives into why we take much more risk with unrealized gains than our capital.\n\n**Of Dollars And Data**: Nick Maggiuli is one of the most insightful and interesting writers in the personal finance space today. He has the unique ability to present the data in a clear manner, while not making it sensational or clickbaity. He usually writes about investing, risk, and long-term wealth creation. My favorite articles of his are: [What Risk isn\u2019t](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/what-risk-isnt/) and [Even God couldn\u2019t beat Dollar Cost Averaging](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/even-god-couldnt-beat-dollar-cost-averaging/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pdjjhv396e81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9a0e829f8bc437d04c3fc8222eade514a40d9af\n\n**Footnotes** \n\n\\[1\\] I have no idea why even in 2022, someone would fill a sheet with a pen and then scan and upload instead of directly listing it in the portal. [Example](https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/view/paper/1f256949-caed-40d5-8076-d9243221bbc4/) of this monstrosity.\n\n\\[2\\] I have considered the transaction date and not the reporting date. Any transaction done in 2021 was considered for the analysis even if it was reported to the public in 2022.\n\n\\[3\\] If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - down payment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking.\n\n\\[4\\] Fun fact \u2192 This is 160% of the total salary that all the senators were paid in 2021.\n\n\\[5\\] The drastic difference is due to the delay in reporting and our short period of analysis (1 year) \u2192 Taking an average delay of 30 days, your returns are highly impacted as you would not have been in the market for those 30 days.\n\n\\[6\\] If you\u2019re wondering why the benchmark keeps changing for different Senators, it\u2019s due to the time difference between their investments. Someone who invested in Feb\u201921 would have a vastly different index benchmark compared to someone who invested in Sep\u201921\n\n\\[7\\] This is heavily skewed towards the top with the top 5 Reps making up more than 60% of the total investment amount. Michael Thomas, Rohit Khanna, and Joshua S all made more than $40 MM in investments just last year.\n\n\\[8\\] Options returns are not included in the analysis as it\u2019s very difficult to accurately judge when the options were exercised based on the publicly made reports.\n\n\\[9\\] To give a sense of scale, all of these folks have a salary of $174K. They have made multiple times their salary just on trading returns.",

    "title": "Inflation is still transitory and the FEDs decision is purely based on political pressure",
    "selftext": "First of all, why is inflation rising? In basic economic terms, its the distortion between demand and supply caused by a substantial increase in monetary supply that was thrown into the economy as stimulus checks. This increase in monetary supply affects inflation in the long run, as it takes time for it to affect nominal GDP and increase money velocity. How did the checks affect GDP? Consumption. The checks where purely given for people to consume the basic needs in order to survive the quarantine. Consumption leads to demand. Now, if you see consumer spending during 2021, the trend basically went to the moon faster than GME. What happened later? Too much demand and no production caused by the economic crisis. This lead inflation to skyrocket.\n\nWhy is it transitory? If you print 4 trillion USD and throw it into the economy, it will be consumed and will create prices to increase. However, you only got 1 check from the government and you already used it. So theoretically, consumer spending should level out back to its original trend. On the other side, as demand skyrockets, companies will start to produce more. So, in the long run, demand and supply start to level out again. And no, dont come with that Keynes bullshit.\n\nWhy is inflation still rising? Well, predicting how high inflation can go is impossible, literally. And the FED is dumb enough to bet that inflation was not going to pass 6% when they literally printed like 8 trillion fucking dollars.\n\nWhy do I think this is political pressure? Because inflation hurts most americans, and politicians like to have peoples vote. And mainly what they like to do is talk to please people. So, right when inflation jumped from 5% to 6.8% and Biden had to nominate a director for the FED, here comes Jerome Powell to suddenly say, \"oops, its not transitory anymore, we will fight inflation with rate hikes and balance sheet reductions\".\n\nAnd, looking at what Powell says in the past, he knows that inflation was going to be higher and that it was going to persist for many months. But it only took 2 months for them to realize it wasn't transitory in the exact time that they had to get nominated and the EXACT time that everyone was talking about how inflation hurts people. I call BS.\n\nHow to easily reduce inflation without market panic? Taking some ideas from 2008 to 2016, they should stop QE and keep the balance sheet constant. And on the other side, the federal government should wake the fuck up and try to keep oil prices low, and stop with this \"climate change\" excuse. And also use military resources in the ports to help with the supply chain issue.\n\nIn conclusion, imagine your going 300 MPH in ur new lambo, and you want to go 50 MPH. What do you do? Well, the FED instead of putting pressure in the brakes (would take too much time), they yank the fucking hand break.\n\nWe. Are. All. Fucked, and nobody in power gives an absolute fuck\n\nP.S: I probably missed many other factors but this is more general terms",

Today is a day for mourning and remembering.\n\nu/HellzAngelz and I are entertained to the core by the tragedy of the rocketship GME. We know we share this joy with all of the people of subreddit. This is truly a global shitshow.\n\nTwelve months ago, almost to the day, we gained millions of subscribers on a brilliant mission to the moon. But we've never lost our shirts in unison like this; we've never collectively gotten crushed like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the holders of the stock; but they, the retarded apes, were aware of the dangers, but bought shares and DRS'd them anyways. We mourn the losses millions of retards who bought high and sold low along the way.\n\nFor the families of the apes, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of the knowledge that apes are retarded. But we feel their stupidity, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a stock, and I'll tell all my friends to buy it.\" They had a hunger to explore the markets and discover its frauds. They wished to destroy the hedgies, and they did. They destroyed Citron.\n\nWe've grown tired of the conspiracy theories on this stock. It's hard to entertain us. But for 10 years this Monday, wallstreetbets shitposting has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of high quality shitposts, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're 11.5 million shitposters strong.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the paint eaters of SuperStonk who are holding onto the stock for dear life. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes other stocks exist on the market. It's all a part of having an economy with more than one company in it. It's all part of having a place for discussion that isn't a cultlike echochamber shouting the same thing over and over. The riches of the market don't belong to those who invest without doing their own research; it belongs to the DD posters who can defend their thesis against derision with verifiable facts. DeepFuckingValue and his detailed DDs was pulling us into riches, and we'll continue to do quality research that would make him proud.\n\nI've always had great faith and respect for our DD posters, and what happened with the nonstop \"squeeze DD\" trash that followed GME does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our losses. We don't delete our incorrect DDs after the fact. We review them publicly and learn from them. That's the way high quality discussion happens, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest for tendies. There will be more hilarious shitposts and god tier DD, and, yes, more dumb memes that people upvote for god knows why. Nothing ends once you're bankrupt; there's always someone willing to lend you money.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every bear who posts on WSB or who submitted a trash tier meme and tell them: \"Your dedication and steadfastedness have moved and impressed us for years. Although we don't understand the nature of your brain damage, we want you to know, stocks only go up.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 36 years ago, the great explorer Michael Smith/Scott flew the spaceship Challenger. In his lifetime the great barriers to making gains were $45 commissions for trading, and a CNBC analyst later said, \"They got their stock tips from their friends at the pub, which was a lot worse than randomly guessing.\" Well, today we can say of the WSB crew: Their willingness to believe in random strangers on the internet was equally ill advised.\n\nThe apes of the moon mission GameStop and others honored us by the manner in which they shit all over the subreddit. We will never forget them, mostly because they will probably stick around for years, telling us of their journey, and wishing us losses as we continue to bet everything on companies with zero revenue and huge losses.\n\n[Thank you.](https://history.nasa.gov/reagan12886.html)",

    "title": "Boomers cause Stock Market Crash of 2022",
    "selftext": "Feel free to quote me. \n\nFor the smooth brain PermaBulls saying the rich won\u2019t let this market fail. Guess what?\n\n\nBillionaires are CASH GANG right now or BUYING PUTS. The rich will most certainly be making money in a crash slow or fast. You\u2019ve got U.S. senators buying Puts, you\u2019ve got Burry CASH GANG &amp; buying Lockheed Martin back in Nov. (that man knows we\u2019re going to war) you\u2019ve got Goldman Sachs Partners getting a one time UNUSUAL PAYMENT (reward) for their efforts in 2021 (biggest Bull trap ever) if you can\u2019t see the rich have already exited their positions, there\u2019s no hope for you. YOUR WENDY\u2019S PAYCHECK CAN\u2019T BUY THE DIP FASTER THAN THEY CAN SELL. \n\nThis crap market started Jan. 5th (probably right when the wage slave algo workers came back from their vacations and tweaked the algos).  It\u2019s clear as day the tech sell off and slow rotation to value stocks are an effort to preserve Boomers retirement funds. The media is labeling it a correction because that\u2019s the only label they can say to not spook the boomers. The media and the markets are trying so damn hard to pump the news. Guess who has the most wealth tied up in the market? Boomers. Guess who isn\u2019t buying the dip? Boomers. Guess whose not here on WSB in big numbers? Boomers once again. Most of the people on Reddit are millennials/Gen Z and maybe some Gen X. \n\nThere are so many boomers retiring from 2020-2022 because they don\u2019t want to deal with Covid or the changing workforce. That\u2019s why the labor rates is so high, their is a massive imbalance from Boomers to the rest of the generations and already their are articles shaming Gen X &amp; millennials for not pushing out enough Gen Z children to keep this gravy train rolling.  \n\nSo how will the crash happen? Boomers are going to want to lock-in their profits so they can stay retired. How much longer of a market downturn are they going to be able to stomach? Boomers listen to Boomer Media so they\u2019ll fall for whatever the talking heads on the media are saying. Cramer saying \u201cdon\u2019t sell it won\u2019t feel good\u201d (always inverse Cramer, don\u2019t forget 08 Lehman Brother\u2019s is a buy, then very shortly later bankruptcy) Big Media pushing out Bull centric articles saying \u201cbe unemotional, don\u2019t look at your portfolio\u201d. It\u2019s all to keep them from noticing. If you\u2019re a millennial or Gen Z go ask your parents right now if they think this is a crash. They\u2019ll just repeat the talking points the media is telling them.\n\n\nAlso I bet there\u2019s a few boomers on this sub reading this. You\u2019ve lived through 2008 and saw older co-workers that were going to retire and then saw the same co-workers back at work because they couldn\u2019t afford retirement because their life savings tanked! You Boomers reading this know that 401ks at the end of the day are still Unrealized gains. Interest rates are going up so it\u2019s not like you  can switch to bonds to try and preserve your net worth either. The only way a boomer can preserve their money right now is going cash like back in Nov. 2021. The 2nd best time is now.  \n\nNow back to the smooth brained permabulls who have only ever known Stonks going up. Ask yourself, do you think Boomers want to ride out a volatile stock market in retirement (media coined it kangaroo market to explain it to them) Boomers have low risk appetite and this market has them spooked. \n\nBut guess what a lot of boomers are going to realize soon if you\u2019re first to sell you\u2019re gonna be alright and make out ok. (The billionaires realized that in Nov. 2021)\n\nNow let use a scenario all of you smooth brains PermaBulls will understand.  Look no further than the whole GME situation. Folks who sold at $300 and locked in the gains were fine and moved on with their lives. Right now there are still bag holders still to this day waiting for whatever their \u201cplan\u201d is. The same way the boomers and their 401k\u2019s are just listening to the media. However the boomers aren\u2019t like the smooth brains holding GME, they\u2019re looking at their LIFE SAVINGS and are going to realize I\u2019m not going to get caught holding bags like people I knew in 2008. \n\n\nTL;DR\nMarket Crash will happen because the talk of it is here and no Boomers are going to continue to hold their investments once they get spooked. Media is keeping things calm because they don\u2019t want a sharp sell off.\n\nDD (Literally everyone\u2019s boomer Mom &amp; Dad) go ask them and watch the same things I just mentioned above come out of their mouths. \n\nDisclaimer I\u2019m holding March puts on anything cheap. Best of luck to everyone\u2019s Boomer parents, I hope they\u2019re able to salvage what they can of their 30 years of gains. If not blame the rich since they not only rigged the markets but the media too.",

I'm down super bad on my portfolio, can't say how much because I don't like looking lmao. And although I seriously doubt all fo that absurd high short interest trading through dark pools and hiding this info SEC, I've noticed that GMEs short interest has increased, which is lowkey spooking me. When I got in 12% of the float was short, but now it's over 20%. That's both scaring me but giving me incentive to believe in one last short squeeze,but then again, I'm smoothbrained and I don't know if we would see a potential catalyst launching us to the moon. I really don't know if I should sell at a loss and YOLO Tesla like a retard or hodl. Question for the bears and people who agree that MOASS is bullshit, is this 20% SI a potential squeeze opportunity? No I'm not a shill, just a clueless investor. No need to downvote me, I'd rather hear points as to why what I said was stupid so I can actually learn a thing or two rather than just downvoted.",

Like what the fuck are you waiting for? Sure I get GME you can argue the turnaround or the NFT marketplace or that somehow a csuite team justifies an absurd valuation of the stock. But like none of that can be argued for AMC it's literally a sinking ship and the CEO selling shares monthly just proves that. I love all you retards and I made money on options on GME, AMC, CLOV &amp; all the retarded shit like that. But I'm out almost immediately after I secure that 1000% + gain... why are you guys holding it still, genuinely curious?",

    "selftext": "Okay boys and girls. I\u2019m going to give it to you dry, and keep it simple. Robinhood plunged off the face of the fucking planet to the depths of hell. Even from its IPO it\u2019s down like -65% if you factor in the ATH of $85 the stock was down -90% when it hit lows of $9.94. I understand this company isn\u2019t profitable YET. They also have a bad rep with the AMC &amp; GME crowd but I could care less what people think who have been throwing money at a bankrupt movie theater chain and a brick and mortar gaming store. Although Q4 was ugly and guidance was lowered for Q1 and comps for both the first and second quarter are going to be tough due to year over year comparisons guess what? After a -90% decline it\u2019s all priced in. The idiots shorting at $9 and $10 really thought this was going to a penny stock. That\u2019s the beauty of the market it\u2019s been pricing in a negative earnings for months before they released them. Everyone was left in awe as the stock reversed its -30% loss then proceeded to close green +10% \nNow the DD. If you look at the balance sheet. Almost no debt. 6B in cash, plenty to get them too profitability, and there\u2019s too many things to list as far as projects they\u2019re working on. What stood out to me is when they said they\u2019re expecting to be profitable by year end or the very latest Q1 of 2023. I\u2019m going balls deep here. This is going to be a year long play for me until they turn a profit end of 2022 or beginning of 2023. I\u2019m playing shares just because of how volatile this market is, but leaps are cheap AF right now due to the epic plunge. Play it how you want but Friday signaled a pretty huge reversal. Also say what you want about Cathy Woods but she added another 2M shares.  She manages 60B in funds so I rather follow her then take stock advice from the Walmart restock workers here. Got another 5k shares in my ROTH IRA. My price target is $45.",

    "selftext": "I know it's a dumb question, but seriously I need help.\n\nI'll describe my philosophy / trading style / some experiences,  so you can understand and poke some holes in my logic.\n\n**Trading Philosophy:**   I have a high risk appetite and am comfortable stomaching swings on  short dated options. In my mind, there's no difference between a 2 year  hold that results in -50% position and an afternoon hold through a spy  swing, potentially resulting in the same -50%. I prefer to know if I'll  be rich or poor ASAP and rather not draw it out. I mostly have a bearish  stance on the current market, so I don't really go long on stock or  calls. Everything feels over inflated and I don't feel comfortable being  a bull.\n\n**Trading Strategy:**  I run a small account and will usually toss 1k in every month or so and  go all in on spy puts. Most of the time I get it right and am up over  100% overnight, sometimes I do it again and again quickly amassing near  1000% returns in a week. Only to fumble the bag the next day. Although  this is a grandiose fireworks display it's wasting my time if I don't  take profits. I tell myself ill pull out at 10k then 10k happens and I  say after the next trade ill pull out. I close the position and show the 10k in BP to friends \"See the bag is secured guys haha!\" \\*immediately goes all in on the next play 5 minutes later\\* I never pull out, continue my all  in yolo snowball and inevitably lose it all on one false prediction.  The problem is when do I sell?  *(not looking for people telling me to buy leaps or join theta gang btw)*\n\n**Trading Experience:** I've only been trading for a little over a year. Here are my big plays which I inevitably fumbled.\n\n1. GME SQUEEZE: $400 - $40k - $0\n2. S&amp;P 500 CORRECTION: $1K - $10K - $0\n\nWhat targets do you set for yourselves to take profits? How do you resist the temptation to keep snowballing?\n\n**TLDR:**  After making money I yolo all into the next play and lose it all  eventually. How do you take profits. Am I not cut out for options  trading?",

    "selftext": "Only a couple of weeks ago you single digit IQ fucks were talking all kinds of hot shit in the daily thread. Saying how bears are fucked and that SPY is going to keep climbing up even though SPY historically corrects after failing to best its previous high more than 3 times.\n\nYou half wits honestly believed that meme stocks, some of which crashed 50-70% are going to recover and that we are \"G0InG 2 dA m00N.\" Like seriously, are 99% of you new bloods literally that fucking retarded? You're seriously telling me that a company that is still losing money by triple digits million and getting fundamentally nowhere is going to magically recover after it's still overpriced by 70%? Where the fuck do you think it was going to climb back to? August 2021 levels?\n\nAnyways, since you are all clearly a bunch of mentally handicapped dotes, I'm willing to bet 90% of you bought long term calls right when GME skyrocketed over 110 and AMC was trading above $17. In other words, right in the middle of a bull trap.\n\nIf I don't see some hefty loss porn on the hot page in the next couple of days, the next time you homos open your mouths, it better be to put a dick inside.\n\n\\*spits on your face through a screen.\n\nEdit: wow, this post is triggering literally nobody.

    "selftext": "I need help figuring out what I should do about this tax liability predicament that I find myself in. Let me take you on a journey of my bad personal decisions of the past 2 years. My first fuckup was discovering options in April of 2020, when stonks only went up. I put in hours to become acquainted with market terminology and studied options strats and stocks strats. Of course in the beginning it was a fun rollercoaster. Ultimately I ended up doubling my 5k account before i popped the question to the parents: \u201ccan i trade your money?\u201d Little did I know that this jump would ruin my health and wealth\u2026\n\nIn november 2020 i had experienced massive loss and was down 50k on our principal. Then I found out about spac investing and shot up 150k before the end of 2020. I was pumped! I paid taxes the following year and all was good. Early in 2021 i hit it big on gme and more spacs and made 200k in an account still in my name. I then sold and transferred all that money over into an account in my parents name. This was my biggest mistake.\n\nThen came the crash of spac and popular growth stocks that sheep retail investors like myself scooped up, and long story short, my parents account ended -300k on the year of 2021, but the original account in my name is listed as up 200k on the year. I can\u2019t file jointly with my parents, so i don\u2019t know how to effectively file so that the IRS considers my family\u2019s trading activity jointly. In other words, how do I avoid this huge tax bill that i can\u2019t afford? I am an unemployed recent college graduate who\u2019s already managed to ruin his life:( I\u2019d really appreciate any input as I am really feeling the implications of my actions. Shame me, console me, advise me, notice me! Internet, please help.\n\nman\u2026i\u2019m so fucked\u2026can\u2019t believe i\u2019d be on this forum like this\u2026\n\nedit 2: Thanks for all the feedback and jokes everyone. Will definitely be finding help ASAP. These comments have made me sweat but have helped steady me and have given me great info and direction on what to do next. Thanks.",

The memes are low quality, and the gain/loss porn isn't engaging anymore. It's just dumb. \n\nNot to mention, the amount of just factually incorrect comments and posts is astounding. This sub has gone from retarded to just stupid, and I for one do not care for stupidity. \n\nI'm tired of the \"every time I buy it goes down, and every time I sell it goes up\" echo chamber filled with the people the hedge funds prey on. We get it, you're always a step behind the computers plugged directly into the exchanges and the algorithms that make up 70% of the trades in the market. You \"trade\" on sentiment without even a basic understanding of business, and then post bullshit to seek validation.\n\nHopefully the new measures will purge some of the riff raff so we can get back to polishing our brains to a fine sheen. \n\nSay what you will, but something needed to be done, and at least the mods are trying to implement a solution they think might work. If it doesn't, we'll reevaluate and go from there.",

I come humbly as one of the baghodlers  of 2022 to seek the opinion of the retards of old. **I prostrate myself at your crinkly old feet.**\n\nRecently,  there was a post about Ortex data which peaked my interest. The  borrowing rate doubled since last week. Normally this wouldn't have  interested me, but when I looked into it the doubling rate seems to be  accelerating towards a doubling every 24 hours.\n\nUnsure  if this meant anything, I decided to look at old WSB posts and noticed  Ortex had similar readings last year - 2 weeks before the sneeze.\n\nI now seek your wisdom.

    "title": "Is it time for a Sens rally?",
    "selftext": "Alright Wall Street degenerates. I\u2019m sure a lot of you already have heard of Sens or maybe are aware of it. It had a massive move over the last two years after almost getting destroyed by institutional shorting during the pandemic. It\u2019s low was ~.40$ a share. It had a peak of around 5.56$ a share on 2/15/21. This was likely a result of short squeeze driven by early institutional investing in anticipation of FDA approval of their 180 day CGM product and retail going crazy over stocks with high Short interest. During the GME run. Sens had another several runs over the summer in anticipation of FDA approval\u2026 but it never came to fruition as the FDA has been largely tied up in approving products related to covid and have been extremely backlogged. \n\nRecently the CEO came out and stated he\u2019s confident in FDA approval \u201cIn the coming weeks\u201d that was in the beginning of this January 2022 and the stock has been on a healthy run since. \n\nHere\u2019s the interesting part of the set up, institutional short average price is $3.44 and that just went\u2026 well negative as of after hours on Friday. Finitel data gives 2.1 days to cover on average for those short positions. (Short avg price also from fintel). Institutional ownership has climbed to 31.4% of the float. The short interest is currently 27% of the float which is a very squeezable sized position especially given the short average time frame to cover and additionally shorts average cost just now going under water. If the FDA does approve Sens this week or sometime before opex (Feb 18) this stock could see a significant movement. The most recent movement on Friday was likely caused by black rock filing a 13g because they increase their share % to over 5% of the company. This gives credence to both fda approval likely happening soon (Sens has been waiting for approval for almost a year now for the 180 day CGM) and it also means they are probably going to keep those shares long which also helps in the event of a short squeeze. \n\nLong term potential: Sens also has plans to come out with a 365 day sensor and eventually have a sensor where you only need to calibrate it once (eliminating finger sticks) they\u2019re current models you still need to calibrate regularly. Also a possibility of expanding into monitoring other serum markers with future products (technology is extremely sound). \n\nIn conclusion. While the float is large there is significant SI ~ 27% with avg 2.1 days to cover and avg cost basis of 3.44 (just went negative) and looming imminent FDA approval for a significantly better glucose CGM than what\u2019s on the market right now. Sens also has long term potential. Black rock just increased its holdings requiring a 13g filing. All in all the set up for an explosive move after FDA approval is there to trigger a legitimate short squeeze. I will be entering some degenerate calls and picking up more shares. God speed gentleman.",

Even if you understand options well the chance that you will make money in short term trading of stocks and options is very low.

Short term trading is their bread and butter and they are the experts in making money doing this. Most likeliy all of you will lose money in trading options and stocks (yes you can be lucky in the short term).  That's the honest truth.\n\nOut of path events like GME last year actually changed that. Yes most of the GME retail buyers are degens that have no idea what they are doing. They don't know options' basics or trading or anything related but still caused a lot of pain for experts. Actually  it's probably because they don't know what they are doing they were successfu in suprising the market. \n\nWSB should be the place for these degens in my opinion.",

Made some money and lost even more mostly on options and crap stock picks from the great Cathie Woods and some of WSB picks like AMC and GME\n\nThe biggest pump at first was from LCID options and of course I didn't sell and it crashed lol then after couple months I got tired of stock market and sold everything ( as shown in stage 1 ) and bought a car and used whats left to play with some other none stocks investments\n\n\nhttps://ibb.co/VQ2wd5C\n\nIn stage 2 as shown in screenshot above I finally got a break and got lucky in the other investments which turned 16k into 135k. The luckiest break I ever had and of course I didnt learn. Oh I got more money now so lets get back in stocks with 85k...turned out to be a bad idea as always. I bought again at top market levels and that 85k is now about 49k\n\nWhere the rest of the 135k you ask? I played more with it in the none stocks and lost it all which is 50k lol\n\nMy current genius position which you should stay away from based on my track record\n\nhttps://ibb.co/VWyJ1Cf\n\n\n\nStill averaging down on that LCID position which I plan to keep for years to come\n\nAs for PLTR idk if im ganna see any of that money back in next 2 years. About 25 to breakeven in the 2 years \n\nHope you enjoyed my journey I sure did\n\nOh by the way the money I used at the start was a loan from the bank im still paying lol",

    "selftext": "I use a stock screener called finviz to find stocks that are potentially over/undervalued by financial metrics before deciding whether to open a short/long position. \n\nA few stocks that have been constantly showing up in my screener as being extremely overvalued are Hyatt Hotels (H), Hilton (HLT), Snowflake (SNOW) and Datadog (DDOG). I mainly look at price/sales, price/FCF, ROA/ROE, and P/B.\n\nNow, what these companies all have in common is that they are have garbage financials, are not making money, and have been pumped up incredibly over the past couple years. Additionally, insiders have been dumping their shares like their life depends on it. I own puts on all of these from a few months ago, but I couldn't figure out why these particular stocks kept getting pumped while many other HEALTHIER growth stocks were being corrected due to potential rake hikes and, let's be honest, a long needed correction. However, stocks like SNOW are STILL trading at a ridiculous Price/Sales of 83 and continue to get analyst upgrades by the big banks. I understand that there is corruption and manipulation, but I realized something fishy is going on with these particular stocks. \n\nI decided to look into the ownership of these stocks, and found that Melvin Capital owned a significant position in all of them. In fact, Melvin owns approximately 10% of the entire float of Hyatt Hotels, and has significant positions in all of the others. \n\nIf you look at the financials for many of these, you will find that many of these have ridiculous valuations and continue to get pumped. The NASDSAQ and S&amp;P are both down today while all of the stocks noted above are up. I believe that Melvin Capital is somehow pumping up these stocks (possibly through the options market) and is in bed with the big banks to have them upgraded. Now I don't know how this affects GME, and I still don't understand why and how these stocks continue to get pumped. But I do know that these stocks are heavily manipulated and Melvin Capital is benefitting from it. Could it be possible that they will take the profits from pumping these stocks to cover their short positions on GME?",

Regardless of what you think of the company's future, MOASS, the cult-like hopium echo chamber, etc when looking at the chart over the past year, it's really hard to deny that there has been some cyclical price movement.  And guess what, we're in the process of making another run, as expected based on previous cycles.   Some nice green dildos so far this week with Tuesday +13% and Wednesday +7.5% but have no fear,  you haven't missed your chance to yolo in you fucking degens.\n\nTake a look at this very dumbed down chart:  [https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png)\n\nAll I'm trying to show here is the approximate 60-trading day cycle that we can track over the past year from peak to peak. It's important to note that the sneeze last January was not tied to any of these cycles.   Based on the 60-day cycle, the current run will peak around 2/18, which is in line with a big OPEX clearing date.  What happened around this time last year?  how about the stock more than doubling over a 2 day period.  If we can break the year-long trend and run into OPEX, a  significantly larger move up is possible.\n\nWhile the stock is the lowest it's been in quite some time, it's primed for a big move thanks in part to the options chain.\n\nHere's some fun options activity from today:  [https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png)\n\nSome  pretty nice call buying pressure coming in.   The put/call ratio has  flipped to heavily favor calls, both in volume and premiums.\n\nOrtex Data:  [https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png](https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png)\n\nConsidering  short positions are self-reported and I don't really trust Ortex data  this all has to be taken with a giant fucking grain of salt but it's  interesting to note that over the past month cost to borrow and  utilization is the highest they've been since before last January with  utilization reaching 100% today. There are some interesting theories as  to why we're seeing this now but that's too complicated for me and not  important to the point i'm trying to make.\n\nTo show my level of weaponized autism, you can see my positions below.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/mk5EArk.png](https://i.imgur.com/mk5EArk.png)\n\nOh also, [https://i.redd.it/dkzcb7poux381.jpg](https://i.redd.it/dkzcb7poux381.jpg)\n\nThe  data i reference has bIeen pulled from various posts/DD of late and is  not my original content. Considering my extremely low IQ, I'm not nearly  capable of coming to these conclusions on my own.  What's been  particularly pleasing to my smooth brain is how multiple people have  come to similar conclusions around these cycles, even when taking  different approaches to get to the same end place.\n\nok, now i'm ready for the gme hate...",

    "title": "2021 Diversification beats Arrogance (Journey and commentary)",
    "selftext": "As 2021 rolled out I was, as always, cautious. I kept buying good fundamentals and editing my ideal entry price to some tech stocks I have kept an eye on. \n\n\nI had used margin to leverage myself 2-4x throughout 2020 and I knew this was risky. Compounding risk by buying risky stocks or leveraged ETFs wouldn't be wise.\n\n\nI had beaten indexing in 2020 and I made the occasional post laughing at people yelling about risk adjusted returns as if that matters. I had more gains than them and all they could do was yell about how risky it was. These are the kinds of people who would pay off a 1% mortgage because holding VTI is too risky. I would take that money into VTI and say this is not risky enough. Oh there were stories about just holding all TSLA or all [redacted] and this and that but I had made several plays on various stocks including a little TSLA and a little SPWR and I was satisfied. I continue holding gold mining stocks.\n\n\nI was at times swamped with Earnings Reports and Earnings calls but I knew one thing and one thing only. \n\n\n**\"You will not predict the future and no one else will, the best gains are made with calculated bets\"**\n\n\nSo I kept my diversification going and adjusted (especially on weeks where 20 Earnings Calls happened in 3-4 days) by ranking my picks from safe with 100% conviction on long term vision (50 years) to risky and has to be reviewed regularly. Then I caught up as I had time. By May it was obvious that I had \"missed\" a wonderful GME opportunity and of course I did. Those who had calls going into January 2021 that expired later that year probably had a chance to retire. \n\n\nWith each wild and irrational swing down I bought the dip and each wild irrational swing up I sold off some of my positions. I was leveraged so naturally I was holding far more in every stock than I could without that leverage, it was rewarding. When I wanted to take a few weeks off in the summer I did. Most weekends I do a blackout on finances and economics on Friday Close and only take a disinterested glance on Sunday evenings.\n\n\n\nWhen politics caused some of my picks to shoot up 10-20% in a week I sold off until I was just holding my long term positions as if I wasn't leveraged. With this market the volatility nearly always allows a lower entry later. Sometimes a week later. Remember I am leveraged so short term profit taking is necessary to take full advantage of what the risk affords me.\n\n\n\nWhen the market sometimes judged a guidance or a short term supply issue as a reason to sell off a stock, I reviewed the fundamentals and bought more. I am not holding stocks that don't have a great long term business model that works today, not just in theory.\n\n\n\nBy October I had decided my appetite for risk had been fulfilled and I needed to deleverage. sold off what I could and by early November I was less leveraged than I had been since April 2020. I saw the corrections and entered some tech positions that I found at comfortable prices. You know what happened next, the dip kept dipping. \n\n\nEntering 2022 I am still up on most of my positions. I have compounded gains due to the way I approached risk. I have removed some stocks from my watchlists that have been unable to adjust to our new economic reality in 2021 and their debt has expanded while their earnings have not done so well adjusted for inflation since 2019.\n\n\n**TLDR** So here I am. 'The crash is coming'. I have beat indexes. I am diversified. I have managed my risk level in a way I find comfortable. I will do it all over again this year. Some will panick or play into some wild conspiracy theories while the wise will take their money and nod.",

    "selftext": "The title should be enough to explain what I am trying to convey.\n\nYes, there may be reasons for a stock's decline. So if it is declining, we should inspect with care for the reason, but the market is irrational and so are you guys, you guys lose your mind (most, not all) and immediately turn your opinion about the stock when it starts on a tear.\n\nI remember seeing all those bear posts in 2019 about Alphabet. It declined a bit and you all were trashing it saying it is a shit company (not just a shit stock). \"I use adblocker and use all those Google services for free, everyone I know is doing the same. I don't know how they will even make money.\", \"Google is irrelevant, they haven\u2019t innovated a single product worth using\", \" I stopped using Google search\".\n\nThe same narrative was prevalent about AMD a few years ago and is currently prevalent about INTC.\n\nEven though, I have no position in GME and think that most of the GME retards will lose money (I played GME around 2020 and January 2021, and after that I exited my positions), I still see the same thing about GME for example. Whenever the stock jumps, everyone suddenly becomes more bullish and when the stock dives, everyone suddenly becomes pessimistic, when the opposite should have happened (though I think anyone holding GME at this valuation is most likely an actual retard based on balance of probability).\n\nCurrently, I see a similar sentiment around companies like Meta, Paypal for example.\n\nThe same goes for Nvidia. Even though I think that Nvidia valuation is a little insane (Nvidia cannot produce 3 times more FCF than INTC in the long run, that's what I think), whenever it dives, you guys say, \"No one can even buy their product, shit company\", when it jumps, \"No one can even buy their product, mega bullish\".\n\nThe only exception is probs Apple and Tesla.\n\n\n**Why did I write such a long rant?**\n\nI finally understood the 2 main reasons why 90% retail traders lose money.\n1. They make bad plays. Mr Captain Obvious.\n2. They become fearful when they should be greedy...\n\nSo, TL;DR: if you actually think something is good, buy when it\u2019s mega down and sell only when you think you have an absolutely amazing play (don't just sell out of winners to chase something you are not even sure of, because most gains come from a handful of right plays).",

Long time no see, bald beard bet (aka bull-fucking-a-bear) guy here with an update (and not a fin advice).\n\nI know, some of you PermaBulls haven\u2019t been feeling great lately, because SPY gay bears like me have been mercilessly interfering with your anuses on almost a daily basis. Well, in that relation, I have no good news for PB - because \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b vanity fair is highly likely to continue, and I fucking warned you about this [300 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)! Therefore, buying puts during pullbacks like the current one looks like a solid strategy to me, as the Big Short 2.0 SPY 2022-3 target is $220. However, I\u2019m not here today to talk about red, but rather I would like to point at the big green dildos candles incoming.\n\n\u201cButt where\u2019s some good green shit, bald man?\u201d - the question I sense floating in the air.\n\nLemme be perfectly clear. GameStop is set to RIP (arses), starting today!\n\n[GME daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/eyiok6qba7i81.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75f49673b175591e2b90f71781210d93d5ae5dd4)\n\nThe technical outlook provided above may appear a bit overwhelming from the first glance, but I\u2019ll explain everything in a *sec*.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I. Elliot Waves and Fibo:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/44h7jobja7i81.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28783785d3c2fc25de11c9b21221d0b1a1d9e535\n\n  \nThe horizontal \ud83c\udf08 lines you see on the chart above is the Fibonacci retracement tool, the measurement starting point is applied to April 3rd 2020 low of about three bucks (shorting hedgies surprised Pikachu face type of reversal), and the top point is Jan 27th 2021 inter-day high of about $450; this period constitutes GME phoenix-like reversal and the first chapter of the short squeeze of everything (squeeze your nuts yourself you fucking bot). Just a quick reminder, that Fibo is used by \u2018traders (anagram)\u2019 for measuring the potential corrective move, and 0.786 Fibo is a sweet and attractive level to hug and support the 2nd, corrective Elliot Wave - EW (for the in-depth discussion of why 0.786 is the perfect level for the price to touch down during a correction, refer to the Big Short 2.0 linked in the second paragraph of this post). All in all, 78.6% retracement level is one of the strongest support levels for the global bull trends that exist, and GME recent price action is the perfect manifestation of that. Therefore I really doubt that we will go below $100 in the near future.\n\n04|03|20-01|27|21 bullish price action used for initial Fibo measurement, imho, also awesomely corresponds to the first Elliot wave of the global bullish impulse. The rest of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 price action incorporates into corrective EW 2 perfectly, in its turn. This one is characterized by lengthy consolidation around $180 (average) followed by a tasty 0.786 dip. The new-born Feb 2022 uptrend is just the beginning of the fresh 3rd EW intensive bullrun, and let me quote Wikipedia here, on its characteristics:\n\n\u201cWave three is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend. The news is now positive and fundamental analysts start to raise earnings estimates. Prices rise quickly, corrections are short-lived and shallow. Anyone looking to \"get in on a pullback\" will likely miss the boat. As wave three starts, the news is probably still bearish, and most market players remain negative; but by wave three's midpoint, \"the crowd\" will often join the new bullish trend.\u201d\n\nWave 3 is my favorite EW, and for GME it will be juiiiicy!\n\n  \n\n\n# II. The year-long resistance and moving averages:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmn9exjsa7i81.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75294d0b4fd86a9ec1746554189201056d8b5138\n\nThis one is really interesting. Take a look at two pink resistance lines first. The thinner, straight one is what I originally identified as the main 2021 GME resistance about half a year ago: all of the previous cyclical bull runs (as well as the original January Sneeze breakout) were caught by it and subsequently reversed; three out of four from those cycles resulted in the powerful false breakouts - which illustrates grotesque selling pressure above this trend line (margin call protection squad maybe?). The dramatic reversal and subsequent bearish price action of each cyclical pattern take up to 90% of each cycle, and that automated, algorithms driven nasty pattern is aimed at keeping the broader investors circle uninterested in the asset, while trying to exhaust the existing buyers and shake weak hands. Well, it looks like there are no weak hands left (thanks 0.786 Fibo supportive buying pressure, coming mostly from \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e direct registering shares), so buckle the fuck up, autist, this rocket goes to moon with or without you.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at the thicker, curved pink resistance which is steeper than the one discussed previously - this reflects additional ~~short dick pain~~ selling pressure inserted on the stonk starting last November. This beautiful smooth line covers all of the false breakouts - and it also incorporates the complete EW2 price action, acting as a resistance through Dec21-Jan22 (almoasst on the chart above) and currently (LFG). You may notice on the chart above, that the price is now trapped between pink curved resistance and the red 21 day exponential moving average - which acts as a strong local support for the newly commenced bull trend.\n\nSpeaking of moving averages. 21D exponential MA is used by traders for identifying the trend locally. For GME it clearly acted as an intermediate support during the uptrend phase of the cycle morphing into resistance for the bearish phase (check the chart above for sup/res). Now it\u2019s SUP, and flipping sup/res usually last for weeks! 80, 150 and 200 day are major simple moving averages which are used for a longer term trend identification, and those were rejected as supports one by one in Jul, Oct, and Dec 2021 accordingly. Now they act as magnetising resistance levels, begging for the penetration from the downside - if you know what I mean.\n\nThe parameters outlined above represent the major resistance zone of $120-$200, breaking through which will shoot the apes into space. Wen break? etaSon:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# III. RSI and cycles:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvc5vkcya7i81.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2d3c1f8816927ab2f56085903bb8234ba3ee310\n\nFutures cycles theory simplified for dummies through TA: check RSI at the bottom, which perfectly structures into the u/W shaped cycles - where peak zones correspond with the quarterly futures rollover dates/periods. Firstly, this RSI trending does not look like normal behavior at all. GG, take a look at this gay bear robo algo pathetic shorting, instead of Porn Hub for once, damn it!\n\nEach time, after that red RSI downtrend completes, we approach quarterly bullrun\u2019s acceleration (purple arrows pointing up). Notice, how Relative Strength Index shoots to its upper gray resistance towards the end of each cycle, and currently we have plenty of RSI upside left. That, in turn, points at the aggressive bullrun in the next couple of trading days. Especially considering that:\n\n# IV. Bonus for tea lovers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah3humfdb7i81.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf7a3505700a404e52abaab03b6a793d9fa5f653\n\n  \nGME 4H chart, cup and handle completed LFG Cup and handle reversal formation has just been completed on 4H, just above diamond handed 0.786 Fibo support, which is ultra bullish. Who ordered nuclear sandwich for breakfast: notice, how the shape has been forming in between blue Fib and pink year-long resistance, and how handle is supported by daily 21 EMA - what a goddamn juicy technical picture! All that is left is to FUK!\n\n# V. In conclusion, I came:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a962znahb7i81.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae74eb857443fec2cad246c7e5ff9f8bcd8ebf8\n\n  \n**TR;CR: GME is set for one of the strongest breakouts and bullruns since Jan 2021. The price action, which had been suppressed through the entire year, has just bounced off the strongest supports that exist, that is 78.6% retracement level (of the entire bullrun from $3). Furthermore, the stonk is entering Elliot Wave 3, that has to be the most intensive one in the structure. Locally, a juicy cup and handle formation has just been completed, which is set to send the price action to 170-200 range, penetrating and conquering the most important resistance zone. The local price action is further supported by 21 exponential moving average, and the futures cycle completion will also push the price hard in the next couple of trading days. All in all, lets fuk, LG!**\n\nPositions or fun\n\nCarefully playing with FDs because fucking MMs know how to destroy calls: a little bit of 170c exp this Friday and even less 230c exp Friday next week; hmm and also FDs are for boys\n\n123 shares bought at 48, 69, 80, 131, 177, 203, 246, 280, 221, 169, 108; directly registering shares is for real gentlemen.",

    "selftext": "Hello you dirty degens\n\nIf this is happening, this might just be History in the making right before our eyes...   \nEDIT: ***Make sure to check out Edit 2 at the end***\n\nI think Meta/facebook is having its Myspace moment, or better yet, its ***bear sterns/lehman brothers*** moment!\n\nIll keep things brief cus im smooth as glass up here:\n\nFacebook lost $225b in market cap a week or 2 ago, \\~25% in that crazy AH dump sesh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Interestingly it was less than 6 months between the peak in Sept and the dump](https://preview.redd.it/dm4s6lnh4hi81.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5019ce36132b0fab02c2c29ab53e9f06eea5d2da)\n\nIt was apparently the result of 1 rule change by Apple that cost meta $10b in revenue. Apple are throttling facebooks data access.\n\nThis headline caught my eye today\n\nCNBC link - [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/google-plans-android-privacy-change-similar-to-apples.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/google-plans-android-privacy-change-similar-to-apples.html)\n\n***TLDR: Google is doing the same thing Apple did.***\n\nSomething else that has been happening in the stock market world:Mark Zuckerberg has held over 50% of FB since founding it and he had an interesting time in those early days! Fought to ensure he had the majority piece of that pie.\n\nHes been selling his stock for ages now. $21m a day IIRC for i dont even know how long. months at least.\n\nRecently Jack Dorsey also left Twitter to focus on Defi banking... interesting\n\nThe douche who replaced him at twitter immediately upped the censorship on the platform in lines with MSM/govts etc demands of \"misinformation\".\n\nIs Zuck about to leave Meta? Is Meta/FB the target for a hostile take over, like Bear Sterns was? Big tech assassination, assisted by the big banks/Wall St to crush it into the dirt so the biggest social media data pool in history can be taken over by....?\n\nBanks? US Gov? \\*World Economic Forum has entered the chat\\*\n\nMight be something to keep an eye on...\n\nIf you are unsure of what happened to Bear Sterns, give this a read. It will blow your mind.[https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)\n\nTLDR: Rival banks in 2008 all ganged up on Bear and short sold their stock into the ground. They then took $10'sBillions of tax payer money to buy (yes, they got paid to take on the bank for pennies on the dollar, after being the ones that destroyed it).After they took over bear, they made short selling banks illegal. Funny that.\n\nEDIT; Just for clarity sake, i have no investments in FB at all. Im all LONG GME BABY! but this post isnt saying FB/Meta is going anywhere, its not! not not, not ever, most likely. Im saying it might be in the process of a hostile take over. Part of that process is crushing it first so its cheap to acquire.Time will tell.If you take financial advise from reddit, you belong here.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: WITNESS ME, RETARDS. I will have the last laugh. You just can't appricaite my greatness!   \n\n\nBehold! Activition Nov '21! Maybe a better title would have been **Facebooks having its Activition/Microsoft** moment.  \nSexual assault scandal, awful press oh no! \"DUMP THE STOCK\" as if big money ever ever ever gave a shit about stuff like that enough to cause a dump like that come'ooooooon brah.  \nIt was a hit piece. A true one, Bobby K is a douche, but I believe a coordinated attack on the share price, for Microsoft to immediately jump in, negotiate a deal/hostile take over(?) and 1 $68B deal later the stock immediately rebounds to where it was, all in less than 3 months. Neat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjcgs34ysji81.png?width=1384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f278654b1b5d2b97930eda2abbd5f5976c917573\n\nI am genius. ",

People seem to THINK they've got some advantage.\u00a0 As I've perused WSB lately I've seen a lot of really good Star Trek-esque technobabble and market speak spilling over into confidence drenched posts. \n\nLet me just remind you, if any person could, with 100% certainty predict the market, or even a single stock's precise movement in even one single day, or even one single hour - they could, with minimal effort and maximum leverage become a millionaire almost immediately.\u00a0 That kind of clairvoyance would basically allow you to walk into a bank and trade nickels for $50s over the counter.\u00a0 \n\nI get it, it's a casino, and I like to bet too.\u00a0 I've had my share (share... get it mfkers?) of SNDL and AMC - though to be fair I found those dumpsters on my own - not cause some neckbeard here told me to.\u00a0 But I also bet smart and hedged.\u00a0 \n\nSo, bet smart, and hedge your bets because if you learned about it here from some post dripping with confidence claiming certainty on what happens in times of war, recession, pandemic, earnings, Friday, Monday, fuck any days... know you're being fooled - even if that isn't their intent. \n\nIn closing:\n'Buy the dip faggots, stonks only go up' - MLK",

And I was like, this would make a cool documentary about an online community nobody's ever heard about.\n\nAnd in the middle of researching, GameStop happened. We were, I believe, the first ones to start shooting; we drove to Las Vegas on January 31st. My GME and AMC positions dropped thousands of dollars in the middle of that first interview I was doing with another member of WSB. It was fledgling loss porn behind the camera.\n\nAnd it just went crazier from here when we teamed up with some Wall Street insiders.

While the probe did not find any actual malfeasance, Gensler has been hinting that he still was monitoring short-sellers. In February, Bloomberg News reported on a sweeping Department of Justice probe of at least 30 short-selling firms and allies.\n\nRetail investors have complained that more shares are being shorted than are available to trade, while keeping alive online discussions claiming market manipulation, potential fraud by short-sellers and the lack of data publicly available around short-seller trading activity.\n\nUnder current rules, firms are required to report short interest data to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority twice a month. Critics have said the quality and frequency of that data isn\u2019t highly useful.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s proposed new rule will look to bridge that gap.\n\nWhile the changes to previously proposed SEC rules have been common, as written Rule 13f-2, would only apply to institutional investment managers that hold \u201ca short position of at least $10 million or the equivalent of 2.5 percent or more of the total shares outstanding\u201d in an individual security, meaning that the SEC would be able to see and share the biggest short sales of individual stocks and aggregate them, providing investors with granular data on those shorts.\n\nFirms also would have two weeks into every month to disclose, giving essentially a detailed 6-week lookback at big short moves and give a much clearer, if month-old, picture of short interest on stocks.\n\nThe rule, as designed, would increase disclosure of what is known as \u201cbuy-to-cover,\u201d essentially when a trader initiates a buy trade to close their short position on borrowed shares, something that short-selling critics likely will welcome as it would aim to further curb so-called \u201cnaked shorting,\u201d a practice the SEC mostly outlawed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis for traders using non-existent shares to short stock of public companies.\n\nOverall, the new transparency rule is yet another push by Gensler to bring more market data out of the dark corners and into the light.\n\nAs he told MarketWatch in an exclusive interview last week, \u201cFinance is ultimately about trust, and the official sector has a role to help instill that trust through a set of rules on disclosure, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

While the probe did not find any actual malfeasance, Gensler has been hinting that he still was monitoring short-sellers. In February, Bloomberg News reported on a sweeping Department of Justice probe of at least 30 short-selling firms and allies.\n\nRetail investors have complained that more shares are being shorted than are available to trade, while keeping alive online discussions claiming market manipulation, potential fraud by short-sellers and the lack of data publicly available around short-seller trading activity.\n\nUnder current rules, firms are required to report short interest data to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority twice a month. Critics have said the quality and frequency of that data isn\u2019t highly useful.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s proposed new rule will look to bridge that gap.\n\nWhile the changes to previously proposed SEC rules have been common, as written Rule 13f-2, would only apply to institutional investment managers that hold \u201ca short position of at least $10 million or the equivalent of 2.5 percent or more of the total shares outstanding\u201d in an individual security, meaning that the SEC would be able to see and share the biggest short sales of individual stocks and aggregate them, providing investors with granular data on those shorts.\n\nFirms also would have two weeks into every month to disclose, giving essentially a detailed 6-week lookback at big short moves and give a much clearer, if month-old, picture of short interest on stocks.\n\nThe rule, as designed, would increase disclosure of what is known as \u201cbuy-to-cover,\u201d essentially when a trader initiates a buy trade to close their short position on borrowed shares, something that short-selling critics likely will welcome as it would aim to further curb so-called \u201cnaked shorting,\u201d a practice the SEC mostly outlawed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis for traders using non-existent shares to short stock of public companies.\n\nOverall, the new transparency rule is yet another push by Gensler to bring more market data out of the dark corners and into the light.\n\nAs he told MarketWatch in an exclusive interview last week, \u201cFinance is ultimately about trust, and the official sector has a role to help instill that trust through a set of rules on disclosure, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'll post my paper testing progress from plutohq in a few days.**\n\n***In the mean time, my wife is now an NFT go place your bids.***",

    "selftext": "&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is equivalent of what happened during GME squeeze when trading halted by robinhood and others\n\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-09/nickel-s-mad-surge-exposes-the-shortcomings-of-the-london-metal-exchange)\n\n And that\u2019s got to change if traders are going to trust the London Metal\u00a0Exchange after the madness of the nickel surge. \n\n Marc Rich, the infamous godfather of the modern commodity trading industry, thought he could squeeze the global metals market at will. It was a time of swashbuckling trading in the City of London \u2014\u00a0regulation was lax and traders did as they saw fit. In 1992, he targeted the zinc market, amassing a huge position on the London Metal Exchange. His bet, however, failed, with prices plunging 25% in a month. The debacle cost him more than $170 million and, ultimately, control of his company, which was later renamed as Glencore Plc.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThirty years later and it\u2019s\u00a0d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: the same hubris, the same lax regulation, all in the same place,\u00a0the\u00a0commodities Wild West of the LME. You just need to replace Rich with another self-made metals tycoon, Xiang Guangda, and zinc with\u00a0nickel.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday, the LME was forced to shut down nickel trading after prices surged 250% in two days. Xiang, who controls the world\u2019s largest producer of the metal, Tsingshan Holding Group Co., had built up a huge bearish bet. After Russia invaded Ukraine, nickel prices jumped on fears of sanctions. The ensuing regulatory mistakes could lead to potentially billions of dollars in losses\u00a0and leave the reputation of the world\u2019s top metals market\u00a0in tatters. \n\n \n\nThis matters beyond the cozy world of metals trading. In the past, nickel was largely used to produce stainless steel, but the metal today is a critical component of high-efficiency batteries for electric cars. Last month, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla Inc., tweeted his company\u2019s \u201cbiggest concern\u201d was nickel supply.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nFor nickel traders, the LME is the main market. That\u2019s where Xiang, also known as \u201cBig Shot,\u201d built his bet over several months. The position was perhaps the worst kept secret of the market, and the LME was aware of its existence.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nHis wager collapsed\u00a0very much like Rich\u2019s did. Except that 30 years ago, zinc prices fell; Xiang\u2019s undoing was nickel rallying. As the price went up, bearish investors like Xiang tried to buy back their bets, triggering a short-squeeze. Until then, the market, though messy, was still relatively orderly.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, things got weird. The more the traders bought, the more they pushed the price higher in\u00a0a self-feeding frenzy.\u00a0Nickel prices jumped 90% on Monday, the biggest ever one-day jump. Despite clear signs of stress, the LME decided to\u00a0re-open in the early hours of Tuesday. But the short-squeeze got worse overnight in London and\u00a0prices climbed much higher. At one point, they hit an all-time high of $101,365 per metric ton, up from $20,175 a ton\u00a0in January. At 8:15 a.m. in London, the LME finally closed the nickel market. By then, commodities traders had been busy\u00a0betting billions of dollars in nickel and other cross-commodity deals. The LME also decided to cancel all the overnight transactions, which made a farce of its principles of free-and-fair trading.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThe exchange should have shut down at the end of Monday \u2014\u00a0and\u00a0the U.K.\u00a0regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, should have insisted on it. The LME needs to own that it created a\u00a0problem with its decision to allow trading to continue. Hundreds of millions of dollars in profits \u2013 and losses \u2013 have now vanished because it has scrapped the overnight trades. Why did it do that? No one seems to know.\n\nThe exchange probably fears that several of its members would had gone out of business if the trades had stood. If that\u2019s the case, the LME is, in effect,\u00a0bailing them out with money that belongs to the bullish traders who would have made profits overnight. The crisis is so grave that the LME plans to keep the nickel market closed until\u00a0at least\u00a0March 11.\n\n Policy changes are needed: The exchange needs to implement position limits to reduce the ability of a single trader like Big Shot\u00a0to take huge positions. Even without those limits, the exchange \u2014\u00a0and the FCA \u2014\u00a0have the ability to use their moral authority to encourage traders to reduce their bets. They should have used it with Xiang days, if not weeks,\u00a0ago. Daily maximum price fluctuations limits need to be established, too.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nThe FCA also has some explaining to do: How is it possible that this happened under its nose? Even though the agency started operations only in 2013, there\u2019s been a lot in the historical record\u00a0for it to review: from the tin crisis in 1985 to Rich and his zinc bet to the Sumitomo copper scandal in 1996. Why didn\u2019t the FCA ask the LME to close the market on Monday, or in the early hours of Tuesday? Was anyone at the FCA actually watching the screen at at 4:00 a.m London time as nickel jumped 45% in a matter of minutes?\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of the work to restore trust in the market will fall to the next LME chief executive officer. The LME\u2019s current leader, Matthew Chamberlain, announced earlier this year that he would depart in late April to join a cryptocurrency company. He should\u00a0know all about\u00a0volatility by then.\n\nHere LME CEO basically saving his few members from being blown up \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-03-09/lme-ceo-suspending-nickel-trading-was-right-decision-video",

Ya know, the place where you buy nice white towels then get shit stains on them and return them 9 months later to some poor highschooler who makes $11/hr. That place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI strongly contend that $BBBY will continue to squeeze and will ignite the meme mania once again. The market is desperate for MOMO and runners. I think OIL has shown that well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvclrkztiam81.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0ad8038d91932b73d2f502208623a742c6b994b\n\n$BBBY had an excellent day today.

Namely the $25 range.\n\nIV has spiked to the moon. It's not worth buying calls on $BBBY... HOWEVER...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$BB is trading at an abysmal $6!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01zvgq0fjam81.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7e1163eeb48d961fd44efc53159c894eff0d66\n\nNow we're all smooth brains here.

SI is only around 6%. Now she's a bit of a heftier float at 571m, more akin to $AMC than $GME. BUT.. Her IV is as low as your IQ.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe can pick up $9C weeklies on $BB right now for $.01. **That's right one abe lincoln and you've got yourself some FD's.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHERE'S THE PLAY!\n\n$BBBY is gonna keep squeezing. I think after the float switched hands yesterday we see continued buying pressure. I mean shit Ryan Cohen himself said that $BBBY has enough value in $BABY to spin that off right now and be worth the entire market cap of $BBBY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can read his whole letter here: [https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK--SO WE'VE GOT IV THAT'S SPIKED FOR $BBBY. Be a degen and buy some calls, sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, the real money to be made is in the meme stocks that haven't run, are the most beaten down, and have the lowest IV. (even a simple IV spike from a huge market sell off, like we're experiencing now, or a meme stock craze would turn $.01 into $.50, that's a 50 bagger ladies and retards).\n\n**Poositions:**\n\n**4,500 $BB 9C 3/11**\n\n**250 $BBBY 22.5C 3/11**\n\n**5,000 Shares of $BB**\n\n**2,000 Shares of $BBBY**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It burns when I pee, rubbing alcohol up the urethrae was not a good move.

    "selftext": "I am a corporate lawyer. I represent public companies. I have watched from the side lines as you all have talked for the last year or so about how revolutionary you are being by demanding the transfer agents of the companies in which you own stock move your shares from the street names of your brokers to your own registered names at AST, ComputerShare, EQ (pre-merger) etc. Here is an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate\\_wall\\_street/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate_wall_street/) \n\nMy impression has been, wow, these people really have no idea how absolutely insignificant this move is to the brokers weighed against the negative effects it is likely to have on their companies, whose expenses for administering this increased number of registered SHs are going to go up substantially.\n\nNow I'm starting to see the rubber meet the road. This week I saw the first invoices from Broadridge for annual meeting services this year, which are up 35-65% for  my clients because their registered shareholder pool has gone up by, depending on the client, hundreds/thousands of individuals/entities because of your \"movement.\" I guess you don't realize that for every new registered shareholder, the company has to pay like $1,000 extra each year to Broadridge for searches, report tabulation, voting, mailing proxy statements and cards, mailing annual reports, etc. not to mention many issuers are now exceeding the limits of the transfer agent contracts so they are paying per SH out the ass to AST/Computershare. I am seeing company's annual meeting bills and transfer agent quarterly invoices go up by $100,000s for absolutely no reason. I can only imagine how crazy the transfer agent/Broadridge bills are this year for a true meme stock like GME; I assume at least $1 million.\n\nI really have no skin in this game other than the solvency of my clients so they can pay my invoices and I don't really care either way really except I think it's funny to point out that by taking this untutored stance against your brokers who, trust me, don't give a shit whether your 23 GME shares are on their books or AST's, you are actually costing the companies you are trying to long literally hundreds of thousands of dollars for basically no reason (not to mentioned the poor beleagured stock administration teams at your portfolio companies who are like, \"wait, what someone wants to hold 7 shares at AST, that's like 20 minutes of paperwork I didn't need or want to add to my plate\").\n\nIn other words, you played yourself.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Since then the stock has jumped quickly to the $3.20 range. $CLOV showed its power last June when its launched it way up to a high of $28. With the company on path to 3+ Billion in revenue this year it is way under valued. The Clover Assistant Ai software saving money and lives is what separates it apart from the competition. This should be valued as a tech company which would put the stock somewhere between $15 to $30 based on this years earnings. It is also a prime candidate for a short squeeze which could lead to a much higher price than predicted. The short data does not reflect all the naked shorts and synthetic shares trading hands on dark pools. A very similar setup to $GME before it squeezed itself all thw way to $500 range in a matter of weeks. This is another great opportunity to teach the hedge funds a lesson that the little guy matters.",

    "title": "This is How the (Financial) World Ends",
    "selftext": "So, this week, we saw the start of the total collapse of the modern financial system and the end of the Bretton Woods era of international monetary policy.\n\nBold claim, yeah baby?  You're probably thinking this has to do with the war in Ukraine or something, right? Well, it does a little bit, but mostly it has to do with what happened with RSX and LME this week, and a little bit with what happened with Rivian.\n\n**TLDR: Wall Street, China, and Russia are all broke and shit is going to get real over the next few months.  Or, to put it another way, some dude named Noah moved next door and started building a boat in his backyard, and you're just beginning to feel some raindrops.**\n\nLet's start with the biggest shitshow out there, the London Metals Exchange, or LME.  A fair number of people are comparing what happened with LME and Nickel to what happened when Apex Clearing turned off the buy button for the meme stocks back in January of 2021.  And yes, I meant Apex Clearinghouse, not Robinhood you twits, Apex made RH do it, and a dozen other brokers as well.  Vlad was just a fall guy, and not the cool kind that was on TV back in the '80s.\n\nWhat the LME did can be split into two parts: \n\n1) they had a massive short squeeze that was fucking up prices, amplified by uncertainty from the war in Ukraine, so they completely halted trading.  This is entirely normal.  It's happened dozens of times in the 144 years they've been open.  Complete trading halts occur in all exchanges whenever shit starts getting fucked up.  For example, US markets were shut down for a week after 9/11.\n\n2) they fucking canceled 12 hours worth of completed trades.  This is the part that should get your knickers in a twist if you were actually wearing any.   \n\nNow, I know a lot of you are sitting there feeling smart thinking \"I know why they did it! They're criminals and stealing!\"  Well, you're right, but that's NOT why they canceled 12 hours of completed trades, just like Apex didn't turn off the meme buy button because they woke up and decided they really needed to use their broker apps to get their fuck on with retail in a big 'ol gang bang. \n\nNo, they did this for one reason and one reason only: survival.  They were dead.  LME let the Nickel market get so fucked up that they not only had to stop transactions, or unwind a couple at the end, they had to unwind 12 fucking hours worth of trading.  I mean, these people are so goddamned incompetent that they didn't even realize they'd been shot in the head, skinned, and turned into a fucking rug for two whole shifts at Wendy's!\n\nUnderstand, they just set 144 years of skimming trades on fire.  It's not little guys buying FDs on the LME, it's big boys and industrial giants.  They all have lawyers and elected officials on retainer, and all of those clients are as done and gone as your made up Canadian girlfriend from grade school.\n\nI can't decide if the best part of all this is the cover story they put out, or how many dumbfucks didn't take three seconds to realize its bullshit.  The idea that Xiang Guangda just said \"I don't want to pay the margin call\" and then the LME was like, \"ok, well, I guess that sucks to be us, guess we'll just pour all this gasoline on ourselves and play with matches\" is so laughable I just got a hernia from ROFLing so hard.  Look, because I know you 'tards are all stuck on the shortbus trying to figure out what I'm talking about, I'll just drive ya'll on over to the explanation:\n\nTsingshan (the company Xiang owns that has the short position) isn't some kind of nickel producer like the papers are saying.  They make steel.  They're the second largest (largest by revenue) steel making company in China.  You know what that steel is used for?  Construction.  Know who hasn't had enough money to make a bond payment in over six months now?  Every goddamned construction company and developer in China.  What, you think they're paying their fucking materials bills?  \n\nHere's a quote from the South China Morning Post attributed to Xiang:\n\n *\u201cForeigners have some activities going on \\[against Tsingshan\u2019s position,\\] we are actively coordinating \\[to tackle the problem\\],\u201d China Business News cited Xiang as saying in a report late on Tuesday. \u201cWe have received a lot of phone calls today \u2013 related government departments and leaders are very supportive to us. Tsingshan\u2019s position, operation and management has no problems.\u201d* \n\nAgain, because I know you can't read, here's a translation of that quote into a picture.\n\n[I specifically said there are no problems, so it's all okay!](https://preview.redd.it/e4shtzkzqwm81.jpg?width=1366&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19e41c0ca232b1309c0abd65f624d5e4f849183c)\n\nNow, why is it such a huge problem that Xiang has no money?  Well, if he can't make the margin call, the short position, much like a politician or anyone who's daddy donated a library to get them into Harvard, fails upwards.  First it goes up to Xiang's bank, which is also fucking broke.  Then it moves onto the LME itself, which again, doesn't have the fucking money.  So what does the LME do?  Same thing the mobsters in Goodfellas did when the restaurant was too broke to steal from anymore, they set everything on fire.  The reason the LME hasn't opened back up yet is because the short position is still there, and nobody who's responsible for that position has the money to cover it.\n\nNow, you might think, if you were smart instead of so dumb you went to Bangkok to get a TIE Fighter, why does this Xiang guy have such a large naked short position he can't cover?  The answer is simplicity itself - he's broke, so he naked shorted his own shit to get paid, then got fucked when it went sideways.  I mean, people here on WSB like to call themselves reckless degenerates, but lemme give you a full \"trust me bro\" on this one, ya'll ain't got shit on the stupid rich fucks that run the world.\n\nThat's part one.  What about part 2, RSX?  Well, as many people who lost money Friday can attest, some serious, serious fucking of Put options occurred.  Van Eck started to liquidate the RSX fund, but they didn't *say* they were liquidating it, so options couldn't settle as cash value.  But they ALSO halted trading of the ETF, so options couldn't be traded either.  And as a final piece of fuck you brokers weren't letting people borrow shares to even fucking exercise the put option themselves.  Wild yeah? (someone else wrote a very good DD on this exact thing this morning, I highly recommend you go read it - no link because automod hates me every time I put a link in my posts)\n\nThis is example number two of someone burning down the restaurant because they couldn't steal from it anymore.  Whatever MM sold those options didn't have enough to cover them, so this shit with Van Eck not stating the fund was liquidating happened.\n\nThat's strike two for all the market makers and exchanges being fucking broker than you when you've gotta go behind the Taco Bell because Wendy's is too high class for your ass.  Let's see if we can a third K to finish them off.\n\nI give you Rivian, ticker RIVN, a truly shitty EV manufacturer, that like most of them can't actually make cars.  These guys are such a clown show that they tried to raise the prices on the pre-orders from the people who waited years to get one.  So they had earnings on 3/10, and it was just about as big of a disaster as you'd expect.  Then, after hours, they dropped $6 bucks on nearly a million in volume.  Everyone who bought puts printed, right?  Nope.  The next day in pre-market, on less than a third of that volume, the price magically shot back up $5.5 bucks, completely wiping out everyone's puts.  By EOD the price had only dropped a total of $3 bucks from Thursday's close, and wouldn't you know it, the price of an ATM put option bought EOD on 3/10 was more than $3. I'd recommend taking a look at the volume numbers and corresponding price movement of RIVN throughout the day on 3/11 and drawing your own conclusions.\n\nThis is like the, what, hundredth and a half time we've seen this exact thing play out now?  It's not an accident.  More money is traded every day in the market on options than stocks themselves.  When the PFOF brokers that retail uses publicly refer to the MMs as \"our clients\", you know the fix is in.  What makes the RIVN bit so interesting is a) how obvious it is, and b) that they're doing this while under DOJ investigation for this exact fucking thing.  That tells me two things, 1) they don't think they'll actually be prosecuted - which, fair, they've got a whole lot of history on their side for this one, and 2) they don't have a choice 'cause they're running out of money.\n\nAnd why, you may ask are they out of money?  Well, it's a mix of things.  1) all the attention from Reddit and the media and law enforcement has clients pulling money from Hedge Funds, leading to sell offs, which when you're leveraged at 137x, leads to a rapid collapse in your buying power. 2)  Russian assets aren't just in freefall anymore, they've hit the ground and started drilling for oil.  3) remember where I was talking about China earlier?  Yeah, their shit is worth even less than the Russian stuff, but thanks to Xi's brilliant leadership plan, people haven't realized that yet.  Below, I have obtained exclusive photo evidence from some of my old SF buddies of Xi and his top councilor enacting their plan to save China's economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If we can't see the lines go down, then are they really dropping?](https://preview.redd.it/r254e9n2rzm81.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e89a6f0629808f8be2f7557a8aa35d6dbcf8a)\n\nAs always, the official info coming out of China is a mix of fantasy, lies, and flat out ignorance, spiced up by a heaping helping of corrupt incompetence.  Because Xi is a tinpot wannabe dictator with delusions of Imperial grandeur, he wanted to make sure that while he was hosting the Olympics everything went off without a hitch, so he told all the companies and rich people in China to make like autists and buy the fucking dip in the equities and bond markets.\n\nBecause all those folks didn't want to get executed by anti-aircraft guns while their families went to the organ donor farms, they did.  Which in this case, means throwing good money after very very very bad money.  It's honestly difficult to describe just how badly China has sabotaged itself.  I'm sure you all know by now about the ghost cities made up of structurally unsound buildings with no interiors, and in some cases no exterior walls.  But, do you also know about all the railways to nowhere that aren't being serviced or maintained?  Do you also know how many MORE shitty tofu-dreg buildings have been paid for by citizens' life savings that aren't yet built?  Spoiler, it's a lot.\n\nMeanwhile, the property market in China is in free fall.  Here's a chart of official chinese statistics on the price of housing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Taken directly from the National Bureau of Statistics of China](https://preview.redd.it/dskl8tmog0n81.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f46d6498440cde7e703d5b55041ec38c6db306)\n\nNow, these prices all reflect worthless tofu-dreg empty apartments that exist only to sell to the next sucker/investor.  Notice that trend line?  Anyone know what happens when that price increase gets closer to zero?  As our friend Lelu from the 5th Element would say \"bada bing boom!\".  For another reference, look at the Dutch tulip market after it popped.  Remember, these are the official Chinese govt numbers.  I'm guessing the actual numbers have gone negative already.\n\nWestern banks, particularly up in Canada, are extremely exposed to the bonds these empty shell apartments are backing.  Western banks, again particularly up in Canada, are also heavily exposed to the commercial and residential real estate markets.  Both of which are in massive fucking bubbles funded in large part by money from Wall Street, Russia, and China.  Guess which of those are now broke (hint: it's all three of them).  CMBS notes started going bad this month - there's a reason all the politicians all of a sudden decided we needed to be back in the office, and the mortgage missed payment rate is skyrocketing faster than the price of oil.  I have not yet been able to figure out if the spike in missed mortgage payments is banks/wall street failing to pay on all the properties they've accumulated, if it's all the missing repossessions from the pandemic finally showing up, or if it's a leading indicator of a new crisis.\n\nI don't know how much longer the powers-that-be can keep these balls in the air, but it's not much longer.  Assuming Russia follows their playbook from the disaster they had in Grozny in '94/'95, we're about to see the major cities in Ukraine get leveled by heavy artillery and rocket attacks.  Which means you can pretty much kiss the Ukrainian wheat harvest goodbye, because all the infrastructure needed to support it will be rubble, along with the roads and bridges you'd need to get it out of the country.  Couple that with what looks to be bad wheat harvests in the US and China barring some big weather pattern shifts, and we're going to see some massive price spikes in the price of bread and other food this summer.  Expensive food = political instability and riots.\n\nThe US will see a fresh round of \"race riots\" sparked by random online videos that are really about inflation and economic inequality, but the media and politicians will go full hog on the race angle, and people will buy it - if you need proof the general population is that gullible, look at how many think the Ukraine war is responsible for inflation and gas prices.  South Africa and Turkey, plus an unkown number of Middle Eastern countries will see Syrian civil war/Arab Spring type uprisings - remember, the Tunisian revolt started as a protest about the price of bread.\n\nFinally, since this is already way, way, way too long for any of you to actually read through, much less comprehend, I'll cut the part about Bretton Woods and the dollar as the international currency super short - there used to be one global financial system that was set up after WWII in a conference at Bretton Woods, hence the name.  By kicking Russia out of it, we forced the creation of a competing global economic system.  Which will likely be headed by China.  That pretty much guarantees another world war down the road, but hopefully not for a decade or two if we're really lucky.\n\nBecause I know my people, here are some tickers to throw money at if you want, I have extremely tiny positions (like one share in a couple of these) in all of them: long WEAT, SOYB, CORN, USO, YANG, short TUR, short EZA, short SPY/QQQ/DOW, long GME.  Oh, and I also just bought a Lincoln, because in addition to chips, the automakers are about to be short on metals too, and somehow a car counts as a fucking growth investment these days.\n\nIf I had the money to do so, I'd also buy farmland with wind turbines and/or solar on it.  Real assets are about to be king, especially food and energy, which are the definition of real assets with inelastic demand.\n\nI'll be honest, the vast majority of my portfolio - over 90%, is in direct registered shares of GME, with a couple shares of AMC because fuck 'em, that's why.  I think at least a couple of brokers are going to detonate like we're seeing with the LME and fuckery like what happened with RSX will become more regular.  Whenever I have a big gain, I pull most of it out and buy more memes and then DRS them.\n\nThat IS financial advice by the way, but you probably shouldn't follow it.",

    "title": "This is How the (Financial) World Ends",
    "selftext": "So, this week, we saw the start of the total collapse of the modern financial system and the end of the Bretton Woods era of international monetary policy.\n\nBold claim, yeah baby?  You're probably thinking this has to do with the war in Ukraine or something, right? Well, it does a little bit, but mostly it has to do with what happened with RSX and LME this week, and a little bit with what happened with Rivian.\n\n**TLDR: Wall Street, China, and Russia are all broke and shit is going to get real over the next few months.  Or, to put it another way, some dude named Noah moved next door and started building a boat in his backyard, and you're just beginning to feel some raindrops.**\n\nLet's start with the biggest shitshow out there, the London Metals Exchange, or LME.  A fair number of people are comparing what happened with LME and Nickel to what happened when Apex Clearing turned off the buy button for the meme stocks back in January of 2021.  And yes, I meant Apex Clearinghouse, not Robinhood you twits, Apex made RH do it, and a dozen other brokers as well.  Vlad was just a fall guy, and not the cool kind that was on TV back in the '80s.\n\nWhat the LME did can be split into two parts: \n\n1) they had a massive short squeeze that was fucking up prices, amplified by uncertainty from the war in Ukraine, so they completely halted trading.  This is entirely normal.  It's happened dozens of times in the 144 years they've been open.  Complete trading halts occur in all exchanges whenever shit starts getting fucked up.  For example, US markets were shut down for a week after 9/11.\n\n2) they fucking canceled 12 hours worth of completed trades.  This is the part that should get your knickers in a twist if you were actually wearing any.   \n\nNow, I know a lot of you are sitting there feeling smart thinking \"I know why they did it! They're criminals and stealing!\"  Well, you're right, but that's NOT why they canceled 12 hours of completed trades, just like Apex didn't turn off the meme buy button because they woke up and decided they really needed to use their broker apps to get their fuck on with retail in a big 'ol gang bang. \n\nNo, they did this for one reason and one reason only: survival.  They were dead.  LME let the Nickel market get so fucked up that they not only had to stop transactions, or unwind a couple at the end, they had to unwind 12 fucking hours worth of trading.  I mean, these people are so goddamned incompetent that they didn't even realize they'd been shot in the head, skinned, and turned into a fucking rug for two whole shifts at Wendy's!\n\nUnderstand, they just set 144 years of skimming trades on fire.  It's not little guys buying FDs on the LME, it's big boys and industrial giants.  They all have lawyers and elected officials on retainer, and all of those clients are as done and gone as your made up Canadian girlfriend from grade school.\n\nI can't decide if the best part of all this is the cover story they put out, or how many dumbfucks didn't take three seconds to realize its bullshit.  The idea that Xiang Guangda just said \"I don't want to pay the margin call\" and then the LME was like, \"ok, well, I guess that sucks to be us, guess we'll just pour all this gasoline on ourselves and play with matches\" is so laughable I just got a hernia from ROFLing so hard.  Look, because I know you 'tards are all stuck on the shortbus trying to figure out what I'm talking about, I'll just drive ya'll on over to the explanation:\n\nTsingshan (the company Xiang owns that has the short position) isn't some kind of nickel producer like the papers are saying.  They make steel.  They're the second largest (largest by revenue) steel making company in China.  You know what that steel is used for?  Construction.  Know who hasn't had enough money to make a bond payment in over six months now?  Every goddamned construction company and developer in China.  What, you think they're paying their fucking materials bills?  \n\nHere's a quote from the South China Morning Post attributed to Xiang:\n\n *\u201cForeigners have some activities going on \\[against Tsingshan\u2019s position,\\] we are actively coordinating \\[to tackle the problem\\],\u201d China Business News cited Xiang as saying in a report late on Tuesday. \u201cWe have received a lot of phone calls today \u2013 related government departments and leaders are very supportive to us. Tsingshan\u2019s position, operation and management has no problems.\u201d* \n\nAgain, because I know you can't read, here's a translation of that quote into a picture.\n\n[I specifically said there are no problems, so it's all okay!](https://preview.redd.it/e4shtzkzqwm81.jpg?width=1366&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19e41c0ca232b1309c0abd65f624d5e4f849183c)\n\nNow, why is it such a huge problem that Xiang has no money?  Well, if he can't make the margin call, the short position, much like a politician or anyone who's daddy donated a library to get them into Harvard, fails upwards.  First it goes up to Xiang's bank, which is also fucking broke.  Then it moves onto the LME itself, which again, doesn't have the fucking money.  So what does the LME do?  Same thing the mobsters in Goodfellas did when the restaurant was too broke to steal from anymore, they set everything on fire.  The reason the LME hasn't opened back up yet is because the short position is still there, and nobody who's responsible for that position has the money to cover it.\n\nNow, you might think, if you were smart instead of so dumb you went to Bangkok to get a TIE Fighter, why does this Xiang guy have such a large naked short position he can't cover?  The answer is simplicity itself - he's broke, so he naked shorted his own shit to get paid, then got fucked when it went sideways.  I mean, people here on WSB like to call themselves reckless degenerates, but lemme give you a full \"trust me bro\" on this one, ya'll ain't got shit on the stupid rich fucks that run the world.\n\nThat's part one.  What about part 2, RSX?  Well, as many people who lost money Friday can attest, some serious, serious fucking of Put options occurred.  Van Eck started to liquidate the RSX fund, but they didn't *say* they were liquidating it, so options couldn't settle as cash value.  But they ALSO halted trading of the ETF, so options couldn't be traded either.  And as a final piece of fuck you brokers weren't letting people borrow shares to even fucking exercise the put option themselves.  Wild yeah? (someone else wrote a very good DD on this exact thing this morning, I highly recommend you go read it - no link because automod hates me every time I put a link in my posts)\n\nThis is example number two of someone burning down the restaurant because they couldn't steal from it anymore.  Whatever MM sold those options didn't have enough to cover them, so this shit with Van Eck not stating the fund was liquidating happened.\n\nThat's strike two for all the market makers and exchanges being fucking broker than you when you've gotta go behind the Taco Bell because Wendy's is too high class for your ass.  Let's see if we can a third K to finish them off.\n\nI give you Rivian, ticker RIVN, a truly shitty EV manufacturer, that like most of them can't actually make cars.  These guys are such a clown show that they tried to raise the prices on the pre-orders from the people who waited years to get one.  So they had earnings on 3/10, and it was just about as big of a disaster as you'd expect.  Then, after hours, they dropped $6 bucks on nearly a million in volume.  Everyone who bought puts printed, right?  Nope.  The next day in pre-market, on less than a third of that volume, the price magically shot back up $5.5 bucks, completely wiping out everyone's puts.  By EOD the price had only dropped a total of $3 bucks from Thursday's close, and wouldn't you know it, the price of an ATM put option bought EOD on 3/10 was more than $3. I'd recommend taking a look at the volume numbers and corresponding price movement of RIVN throughout the day on 3/11 and drawing your own conclusions.\n\nThis is like the, what, hundredth and a half time we've seen this exact thing play out now?  It's not an accident.  More money is traded every day in the market on options than stocks themselves.  When the PFOF brokers that retail uses publicly refer to the MMs as \"our clients\", you know the fix is in.  What makes the RIVN bit so interesting is a) how obvious it is, and b) that they're doing this while under DOJ investigation for this exact fucking thing.  That tells me two things, 1) they don't think they'll actually be prosecuted - which, fair, they've got a whole lot of history on their side for this one, and 2) they don't have a choice 'cause they're running out of money.\n\nAnd why, you may ask are they out of money?  Well, it's a mix of things.  1) all the attention from Reddit and the media and law enforcement has clients pulling money from Hedge Funds, leading to sell offs, which when you're leveraged at 137x, leads to a rapid collapse in your buying power. 2)  Russian assets aren't just in freefall anymore, they've hit the ground and started drilling for oil.  3) remember where I was talking about China earlier?  Yeah, their shit is worth even less than the Russian stuff, but thanks to Xi's brilliant leadership plan, people haven't realized that yet.  Below, I have obtained exclusive photo evidence from some of my old SF buddies of Xi and his top councilor enacting their plan to save China's economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If we can't see the lines go down, then are they really dropping?](https://preview.redd.it/r254e9n2rzm81.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e89a6f0629808f8be2f7557a8aa35d6dbcf8a)\n\nAs always, the official info coming out of China is a mix of fantasy, lies, and flat out ignorance, spiced up by a heaping helping of corrupt incompetence.  Because Xi is a tinpot wannabe dictator with delusions of Imperial grandeur, he wanted to make sure that while he was hosting the Olympics everything went off without a hitch, so he told all the companies and rich people in China to make like autists and buy the fucking dip in the equities and bond markets.\n\nBecause all those folks didn't want to get executed by anti-aircraft guns while their families went to the organ donor farms, they did.  Which in this case, means throwing good money after very very very bad money.  It's honestly difficult to describe just how badly China has sabotaged itself.  I'm sure you all know by now about the ghost cities made up of structurally unsound buildings with no interiors, and in some cases no exterior walls.  But, do you also know about all the railways to nowhere that aren't being serviced or maintained?  Do you also know how many MORE shitty tofu-dreg buildings have been paid for by citizens' life savings that aren't yet built?  Spoiler, it's a lot.\n\nMeanwhile, the property market in China is in free fall.  Here's a chart of official chinese statistics on the price of housing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Taken directly from the National Bureau of Statistics of China](https://preview.redd.it/dskl8tmog0n81.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f46d6498440cde7e703d5b55041ec38c6db306)\n\nNow, these prices all reflect worthless tofu-dreg empty apartments that exist only to sell to the next sucker/investor.  Notice that trend line?  Anyone know what happens when that price increase gets closer to zero?  As our friend Lelu from the 5th Element would say \"bada bing boom!\".  For another reference, look at the Dutch tulip market after it popped.  Remember, these are the official Chinese govt numbers.  I'm guessing the actual numbers have gone negative already.\n\nWestern banks, particularly up in Canada, are extremely exposed to the bonds these empty shell apartments are backing.  Western banks, again particularly up in Canada, are also heavily exposed to the commercial and residential real estate markets.  Both of which are in massive fucking bubbles funded in large part by money from Wall Street, Russia, and China.  Guess which of those are now broke (hint: it's all three of them).  CMBS notes started going bad this month - there's a reason all the politicians all of a sudden decided we needed to be back in the office, and the mortgage missed payment rate is skyrocketing faster than the price of oil.  I have not yet been able to figure out if the spike in missed mortgage payments is banks/wall street failing to pay on all the properties they've accumulated, if it's all the missing repossessions from the pandemic finally showing up, or if it's a leading indicator of a new crisis.\n\nI don't know how much longer the powers-that-be can keep these balls in the air, but it's not much longer.  Assuming Russia follows their playbook from the disaster they had in Grozny in '94/'95, we're about to see the major cities in Ukraine get leveled by heavy artillery and rocket attacks.  Which means you can pretty much kiss the Ukrainian wheat harvest goodbye, because all the infrastructure needed to support it will be rubble, along with the roads and bridges you'd need to get it out of the country.  Couple that with what looks to be bad wheat harvests in the US and China barring some big weather pattern shifts, and we're going to see some massive price spikes in the price of bread and other food this summer.  Expensive food = political instability and riots.\n\nThe US will see a fresh round of \"race riots\" sparked by random online videos that are really about inflation and economic inequality, but the media and politicians will go full hog on the race angle, and people will buy it - if you need proof the general population is that gullible, look at how many think the Ukraine war is responsible for inflation and gas prices.  South Africa and Turkey, plus an unkown number of Middle Eastern countries will see Syrian civil war/Arab Spring type uprisings - remember, the Tunisian revolt started as a protest about the price of bread.\n\nFinally, since this is already way, way, way too long for any of you to actually read through, much less comprehend, I'll cut the part about Bretton Woods and the dollar as the international currency super short - there used to be one global financial system that was set up after WWII in a conference at Bretton Woods, hence the name.  By kicking Russia out of it, we forced the creation of a competing global economic system.  Which will likely be headed by China.  That pretty much guarantees another world war down the road, but hopefully not for a decade or two if we're really lucky.\n\nBecause I know my people, here are some tickers to throw money at if you want, I have extremely tiny positions (like one share in a couple of these) in all of them: long WEAT, SOYB, CORN, USO, YANG, short TUR, short EZA, short SPY/QQQ/DOW, long GME.  Oh, and I also just bought a Lincoln, because in addition to chips, the automakers are about to be short on metals too, and somehow a car counts as a fucking growth investment these days.\n\nIf I had the money to do so, I'd also buy farmland with wind turbines and/or solar on it.  Real assets are about to be king, especially food and energy, which are the definition of real assets with inelastic demand.\n\nI'll be honest, the vast majority of my portfolio - over 90%, is in direct registered shares of GME, with a couple shares of AMC because fuck 'em, that's why.  I think at least a couple of brokers are going to detonate like we're seeing with the LME and fuckery like what happened with RSX will become more regular.  Whenever I have a big gain, I pull most of it out and buy more memes and then DRS them.\n\nThat IS financial advice by the way, but you probably shouldn't follow it.",

    "title": "3/14/22 SPY Daily TA",
    "selftext": "Ah yes another day\u2026 and more fuckery afoot. I know I was a victim of the mornings bullshit and got burnt by the exchanges freezing. Overall next to the GME issue that was the most BS ive seen in a while. Anyone watching and trading this morning saw the massive red candle come in breaking all the supports only to magically have the exchanges \u201cfreeze\u201d and brokerages across the markets freeze and magically SPY goes on a nice bull run. \n\nBut atlas no matter the tricks and fuckery whoever was trying to play it was not enough and we still saw another afternoon of selling. Despite the clear red day we did see the bulls end of day save this from getting anymore bloodier than it really could have if it had free rain. \n\nVolume today was another very interesting thing I have been watching for a few weeks. Overall the volume on the day was around 95 million total which is still about 25 mil lower than usual. The last three trading days of SPY have all been below 100mil when the average is up around 120 mil currently. \n\nIt appears China today announced that they are going on some lockdowns for a new? Covid variant which is about the only explanation I have for why VIX opened near 31 dipped to a low of 30 around market open only to go on an absolute tear up to its peak of 33 around 245pm when we saw the bulls finally take some control. It will be interesting to see how the markets react to this throughout the week.\n\nTomorrow we have the first day of FOMC meeting, however, as far as I can tell (outside of leaks) there will be no information released until 2pm on WEDNESDAY. Tomorrow is the first day of the \u201cmeeting\u201d from what I understand but markets should not get any news. Currentlly the first rate hike is scheduled to be released at 2pm Wednesday.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f0bm9kc2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122e09056cbf1c9627dad6e8ad7843e3b9aa0826\n\nWhat do you see when you looked at this? I see an overall big bear channel down with some intra-levels but they are all going down. This leaves room for us to trade up or down depending on the day. However, the overall trend continues since January to be downward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfrdj1jd2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52f792738300375b5e7715adb8703898e670f51\n\nTomorrow my expected range if we have a bullish day would be to \u201clevel up\u201d near 422-423. IF SPY can get above that 423 mark it could continue to the next \u201clevel up\u201d around 428-430. \n\nHowever, If SPY has another red day tomorrow the next level down is 405 to 408. If that level fails we will finally breach into the upper 300s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ix6pbce2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c357daf0e592f9d8f1ced2a0b820ae5e73d20758\n\nThe futures show a similar trend line. Its major support is near 4082. If it can break above 4176 over night it could see a nice gap up. However a rejection at the last diagonal dotted resistance line could result in quiet the bearish move tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58qg4uif2gn81.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814c28bb8482a52e72f70fbea86dc2c1a5ae1fb2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvn8e72g2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4603fb9582caa2d05b09ea40b1820435e9bc612\n\nOn the daily chart the first picture I highly two important candles and then the next pic is unaltered to allow you to see it more clearly\u2026 what do you see here? I see two nearly identical candles and see a double bottom. Its not perfect double bottom but for a daily chart 3/8= 415.12 and today a low of 415.79\u2026 well that\u2019s a pretty dang close double bottom to me. It almost reminds me of the inverse of the two green double top candles from February 2nd and 9th. \n\nWhat do I think that means? Well personaly with that long upper wic from the morning I would NOT be surprised to see a nice gap up for futures over night and/ or a green day tomorrow. My anticipation also will be the markets running up SPY tomorrow in anticipation of FOMC being good and only a 0.25bps rate hike. I feel like lately markets love to run this up end of the day. We also finished above the midchannel support line today too, however, continuing to wic above the daily 8 ema but finishing BELOW it really is a very bearish sign. The 8 and 20 EMA are darn near 30 degree angles straight down and the 50 ema is now only $3 from the 200 EMA to complete the allusive death cross. \n\nFor bulls to get a leg up tomorrow we need to see Futures hold its green over night and we need to see the VIX continue its end of the day sell off and breach 31 and inevitably 30. At this range a nice unwinding of the VIX would lead to a very green day. Its very possible tomorrow is green. I don\u2019t know about 3% green but it very well could be nice and green. \n\nBears need to see futures lose its current green, the vix continue back up near 33 and break this double bottom at 415. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nUnfortunately got burnt by the market wise freeze of exchanges this morning so took a pretty big hit there. Thankfully I had only risked about 20% of my normal allotted per option amount. After that I decided to stay with my 20% of my allotted amount and I also continued to test a new indicator out. Overall still learning how it ticks but overall I am a fan. I also have no idea what happened to my TOS at the end of the day (even TOS help desk says they didn\u2019t see it on their side) but around 3pm I was in a call. I watched on my TOS desktop a put open up randomly. My call then close out red before my eyes and the put then close out before my eyes red too. I asked TOS about it and they didn\u2019t really have much to see about it. I have no idea what happened and have no explanation for it and neither did they. The only thing I noticed is the 15min candle had a massive quick dip and recovery at the same time. Overall not a fan. But none the less made 10 trades for 50% green and 50% red. For a total gain of 1% and a small loss. I do really need to get back to my normal one trade a day and now that I feel a little more comfortable with this new indicator I will continue to watch it. I got too cocky with it today for sure and over traded my gains away at the end of the day which is a cardinal sin. But overall tomorrow is a new day! \n\nI will take a small loss (which really my put was up 15% before exchanges froze this morning and ended up closing it down around 20% by time TOS \u201cadjusted it\u201d for me and the fanthom put I didn\u2019t even enter along with the call randomly closing out for me (and no im not on margin) overall not a bad day today). Everyday is a lesson. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember- DM me if youd like to stay in touch after April 2nd as these will no longer be posted daily...",

    "title": "Why I think HYMC is an Amazing play for AMC, Regardless if HYMC does a share offering... Meme Stock Inception \ud83e\udd2f",
    "selftext": "Thinking about why I first bought shares of AMC over a year ago, it was after the news started covering the Gamestop story and I wanted to get in on it, but at the time a share of Gamestop was over $50 while I could get a share of AMC for under $14 \n\n\nAMC has always been the value-brand short squeeze play, with the price of a share of AMC being nearly a quarter of the price of a GME share... I like many people bought AMC because we saw it was Shorted like GME but our money could buy many more shares of AMC than we'd get shares of GME.\n\n\nFor this reason I think HYMC is a great play by AMC, After all HYMC is an extremely cheap stock right now with a low float, meaning it would be very easy for retail investors to buy up all the shares of HYMC. Drawing new investors into this mining company that has a high short interest, low float, and low cost is an Amazing short squeeze play!!! \n\n\n However short squeeze aside, drawing in new investors to HYMC and allowing HYMC to generate more liquidity with a share offering will benefit both AMC &amp; HYMC in the long run, Yes while I know a Share offering will make it harder for a short squeeze to happen on HYMC it will generate the liquidity (money) that HYMC needs to get its feet off the ground and become a very profitable mining company. Keep in mind AMC has pushed a lot of it's debt off for a few years, and even if it takes 4 years for this mining company to be worth a lot more that's still an amazing play for AMC in the long run... \n\n\nBasically it's a great play because the possibility of a short squeeze will draw retail investors in, and if it does squeeze it will cause AMC's stock to squeeze as well... But at the very least if HYMC does do a share offering and enough Apes buy into it, this will result in HYMC being a stronger company with a much more profitable future, which as a longer term investor it will vastly benefit AMC, especially when AMC's debt comes due and HYMC has multiplied in value.... \n\n\nI'm currently jobless so I won't be buying any HYMC, but if I did have excess cash I would be buying HYMC as both a short squeeze play and/or a long term investment. All I can do at the moment is hold my AMC shares and sell covered calls to pay my bills lol \ud83d\ude06  Hopefully I'll get a job again soon so I can get back to buying more AMC...\n\n\nTo those of you who buy Shares of HYMC I wish you all the best of luck!!! To those of you who think HYMC is just a distraction, all I have to say to you is... At the very least this is more positive news for AMC, just getting AMC in the news is good publicity, it's good that Apes have another reason to be excited about AMC!!!\n\n\n*Not Financial Advice, I'm not a financial advisor",

    "title": "New Retarded Trading Strategy - Vapid Value Investing",
    "selftext": "Hi Wall Street bets! I think I found a trading strategy that is so retarded that it actually works. I figured out that, really no matter what stock, as long as the RSI was low enough and the reason that a stock went down was short term or stupid, the stock would go up at the end of the day. I call this the \" Hedge Fund Optimism Effect\". Anyway, here is my plan for it.\n\n1. Go on to MSN Money and go to the top losers.\n2. Look for a stock that sells for more than 5$, you want to have enough volume in order not to get screwed over. Look for stocks that go down by at least 15-20%. Don't do a stock had just had a recent high, it will continue going down. Look for a flat stock.\n3. Go onto [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) and check out the news. It doesn't matter what the bad news is, as long as it doesn't hurt it enough. Click the chart.\n4. Check the RSI indicator at [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com), define \"oversold\" at 20 because we're looking at stocks that have terrified investors.\n5. Go back to MSN money and keep searching stocks in the biggest losers category with the things I told you.\n6. Find a decent stock and search it's RSI indicator. If it is 20 or below and its news isn't too horrible, then you found the perfect stock. Investors, hedge funds and investment banks, are losing their minds for no good, short term reason.\n7. Buy the stock itself or a short term option, provided it isn't priced in.\n8. I suggest you wait until the end of the day before you sell stock, maybe wait two. Sell before the third day if it is a risky stock. Use those diamond hands you got during the GME short squeeze. Use Investopedia before you YOLO your student loans on a stock, actually get to know what you are doing.",

    "selftext": "Reposting here to WSB just because I see a ton of FUD on my reddit after the latest GME ER. I am specifically talking numbers, not speculative \"things\", and to those who consider themselves investors and in particular newbies (traders you can ignore)... in hopes that it may educate you and perhaps calm you through the ebs and flows.\n\nAlthough  we're living in a twilight-zone market right where fundamentals seem to  be an afterthought, they are still important, and I want to walk away  from other \"things\" for a moment and just talk about the earnings report  from a strictly numbers perspective.\n\nAs  a fundamental investor, cash flow is one of the more important things  to look at, it's part of the moat that WB talks about, and tells a great  story on how responsible the company is with your money.\n\nNow, the reason why GME is down in part is because it's hemorrhaging cash and the 52 week cash flow shows:\n\n* Net loss from operations  getting worse  \n\n   * partially  because cost of sales widening and merchandise sales weren't all that  sexy (however, keep in mind cogs is relative to earnings which in this  case gross earnings not very good)\n   * As an investor and in this environment I would to see this come down over time not up\n* Net  loss from investments grew but in part only because they weren't  liquidating any more real-estate, and capex remained relatively the same  \n\n   * Again,  its understandable given the transformation that Capex is where it is  but they should work this down as the transformation to a \u201ctechnology\u201d  based company comes to fruition\n* The  Net gain from financing is the only real positive, but nothing new.  They knocked out debt and raised capital during the offering last year.  Bottom line, the company risks doing this again (which \"could\" mean  dilution of shares if not improving their other cash flows).\n\nNow  I am here for the long-term, DRSing like everyone else, believe in RC  and the strategy so this is not FUD (fact check my other posts). This is  simply some helpful things to look at when investing in companies.\n\nFinally,  another interesting metric to look at is P/B. This is one that value  investors traditionally looked at, and it\u2019s a ratio because no company,  at least in the tech industry, trades at book value. Instead, if you  look at tech companies you\u2019ll find that their around a 6x or 10x  multiple\u2026 if you take GME at it\u2019s current market cap and price you\u2019ll  easily see it\u2019s undervalued by a few multiples and the GMEDD valuation  of $160 wasn\u2019t that far off, and perhaps why it was pegged around there  last year.\n\nFor you fundamentalists I would love to hear your thoughts, and some of the key metrics you look at?\n\nTL;DR\n\nGME  2021 cash flow wasn\u2019t the best, \u201cBUT\u201d they are in the midst of  transforming into a technology company and so it\u2019s understandable  (you  can contrast other tech startups).\n\nHowever,  The company does need to improve its cash flow and over the next year  and long-term fundamental investors should keep watch.\n\nThis post is simply an EDU on what fundamentals investors look at, and perhaps some of the reason for the negative price action.\n\nThis post is outside of any of the other \u201cthings\u201d that could happen to GME. It\u2019s simply based on the numbers.\n\nNFA.",

    "title": "GME strategy. Exercising calls and strategically buying OTM puts and calls literally can\u2019t go tits up.",
    "selftext": "I see 3 possible outcomes tomorrow. It\u2019s simple. I\u2019ll explain my theories and tell you how to make money off the possible outcomes. \n\nAs you all know there are a ton of call options that are ITM that weren\u2019t supposed to be ITM this week. I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t see this price action stopping this week so I\u2019m actually going to exercise a few 100 strikes. I doubt I\u2019m the only one because this baby is going to the moon.  \n\nWS is probably going to bring this heat tomorrow more ways than one but here\u2019s how to how you make money and apply buying pressure. \n\nIt\u2019s actually hilarious because I think their only way out is to cheat. \n\nMost likely scenario: I see an iv crush in the AM with no gap down to deter swing traders from buying in. This slow uptrend isn\u2019t working for them today. Apes must have learned patience last year. There will be a de-hedging scenario in which market makers sell their shares (that they never bought\u2026yet) because people with take profits on calls and not everyone has enough money to exercise them. It\u2019s inevitable. This doesn\u2019t change the fact that more calls will be bought but they will get people to paper hand. \n\nHow do you solve this? Clearly you buy OTM puts at the open to hedge your bullish position. This way market makers lose both ways, and the only other solution for them is to cover short positions, pay up on the puts or calls, or get dirty. Long story short\u2026If they need it down then make them pay you for it. It\u2019s ok if you lose money on puts i literally was up 70% on my long calls today and down 80% on my puts. I made no money but I\u2019m prepared and I didn\u2019t lose money. \n\nBest case scenario: as soon as think they won. Someone or institution buys a crap ton of shares, creating fomo again, retail starts buying more calls\u2026WS panics and the road to ATH begins after hours.\n\n\nWorst case scenario: some fed propaganda comes out tanks the whole market and and Gme of course goes down with it on some illegal dark pool derivative Wall Street stuff (I mean, does it really matter right now?) guess what you bought puts and make more money then you would have on calls. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about 0 day options here, at least 1-2 weeks out. I got 20 130 puts for 4/1 and and 60 250 call strikes for 4/14. \n\nAlso is it just me or is the We3d stock shit come back just on time - same as last year. Do you, but I don\u2019t give a shit. Stay focused. You know what\u2019s happening and you know the truth. \n\nTLDR: hedge OTM puts. Exercise calls. Hold. This is how normal folk can help. It\u2019s actually more effective than buying shares rn since settlement takes 2 days but of course buy and hold. \n\nThis is not financial head lice \ud83e\udee0\n\nEdit morning update: As of market open\u2026It appears I should have just bought all calls. I still believe puts close the money still help keep the price up short term.\n\nEdit 2: 11:20am. Scenario 3 literally happened. Shaved off some Gme call profits when I saw the fed was going to speak and figured if I were them it would be a good time to tank the market. That\u2019s another reason I believe the Gme squeeze is the real deal. Bought some SPY 0DTE before 11am in case Gme just kept going up. It was good timing 50x445 spy p 0DTE quick 3x - fuck em. Still not tits up.\n\nEdit 4: it\u2019s 3:30pm idc anymore my tits are jacked for 150-160+",

    "title": "BCG v. Gamestop - Brief Summary",
    "selftext": "It appears that some of you are upset after reading a tweet by Ryan Cohen that somehow, based solely on that tweet, Gamestop should be relieved from paying Boston Consulting Group (hereinafter \"BCG\") for the work that Gamestop hired them to do pursuant to terms that Gamestop negotiated. Furthermore, it is clear that nobody actually read the Complaint filed in this case. I guess I'll put this Walmart degree to good use and break down what BCG alleges.\n\nIn civil litigation (my bread and butter) the Plaintiff files an initiating document (called a Petition in most states, and a Complaint in federal courts) setting forth the factual basis for why they are entitled to relief. In this situation, we have breach of contract claim whereby BCG must prove that: (1) there was an agreement, (2) Plaintiff performed the agreement, (3) Defendant breached the agreement, and (4) Plaintiff was damaged by Defendant's failure to perform. Here, the damages are the unpaid fees of \\~$30MM as well as any pre or post-judgment interest. They allege a second count for breach of good faith/fair dealing.  To state a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a Plaintiff must generally plead: (1) the existence of a contractual relationship, (2) Plaintiff's performance under the contract; (3) Defendant unfairly prevented the plaintiff from receiving the benefits it was entitled to under the contract; and (4) injury to the Plaintiff as result of defendant\u2019s conduct.\n\nI've seen some people complain that this is (1) in Federal Court, and (2) that this was filed in Delaware. The reason this was filed in federal court is that it can be. Sophisticated parties generally like litigating in federal court forums because discovery is faster, discovery issues are resolved more expediently, and the rules of civil procedure and caselaw regarding discovery is favorable. A case can be filed (or removed to) federal court if the basis for the suit is (1) one arising out of federal law, or (2) a case of diversity jurisdiction. We have the latter here. A cause that would otherwise be heard in state court is heard in federal diversity if: (1) the parties are of two separate states, and (2) the amount in controversy exceeds $75k. The parties here are diverse here as BCG is a MA corporation with its primary place of business in MA. Gamestop is a Delaware corporation with its primary place of business in Texas. Without getting too much into the procedural weeds, the USDC of Delaware is a perfectly fine place for this case to be heard.\n\nIn short, BCG explains that Gamestop hired them in 2019 to help turn around the company as it was losing money, market share, and its investors were hemorrhaging money especially when compared to investors in Gamestop's competitors. In 2018, Gamestop had three different CEOs, not to mention other executive turnover. BCG negotiated the agreement with Dan Kaufman, Gamestop's GC, who left in 2020. The finalization of that agreement took four months, and the parties settled on 10 distinct workflows whereby BCG aimed to reduce costs or increase profit. BCG would be paid on the greater of the following: (1) a fixed fee, or (2) *projected* profit improvement. (Emphasis mine).  In sum, whichever was higher would be the fee paid to BCG. Gamestop specifically negotiated the BCG's compensation would be tied to the anticipated profit improvements resulting from their work, **not** actual profit improvements. (Emphasis in original). After work had started, Kaufman left Gamestop and his position was assumed by Jim Bell, the new CFO of Gamestop. At that time, Gamestop began breaching their agreement by failing to pay fees, demanding discounts, failing to continue appearing at mandatory meetings to confirm profit improvement estimates and their fees.\n\nBCS maintains that their work not only met initial expectations for profit improvement, but exceeded them. As an example, they point to the customer loyalty program and adjustments to marketing leading to $73MM in run-rate profit. As a practical matter, and taking the Complaint at its face, BCG does not need to prove that Gamestop had actual profit improvement based upon their work - they apparently negotiated that specifically. However, it looks like GME took other advice from BCG in early 2020 including cost-containment measures, inventory optimization, and focusing on high margin products.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to be mad that your favorite retailer is getting sued for $30MM, perhaps redirect your ire toward Gamestop's former management. Also, it's $30MM, who cares?\n\nPS: The Complaint can be viewed here: [https://public.pacerdash.com/free-docs/ded-78379-1-0-complaint-b1e22848e38eb8317c64.pdf](https://public.pacerdash.com/free-docs/ded-78379-1-0-complaint-b1e22848e38eb8317c64.pdf).",

    "title": "A Bear Thesis on GameStop's Fundamentals",
    "selftext": "As most of you know, the main draw for investing in GME is the MOASS. This post will not be addressing the MOASS. Nor will it be addressing the potential this stock has for swing trading, nor any of the other factors that can inflate a stock's price beyond its fundamental value. What it will address is the group of people (most of whom have already put most or all of their life's savings into this stock) who would like to believe that GME is bound to be a rock-solid investment even without a MOASS because of its strong fundamentals, which position it to become the next Amazon.\n\nThis is somewhat of a cross-post from a post I made in the meltdown DD sub, though I have made a few edits.\n\nFirst, let's consider GameStop's starting point. GME is worth over $150/share primarily because it's being held up by swing traders and apes who are invested not primarily because of fundamentals, but because of its high volatility and perceived squeeze potential. Prior to retail becoming so heavily devoted to the squeezing the shorts, GME was being traded for about $4/share. Even before the pandemic, GME was being traded for less than $6/share. We commonly think of GME as a stock that jumped from $20 to $483, but it actually started much lower. Even at $20, it was being held up by investors who were more interested in short squeezes than the company's fundamentals. Of course, there are many apes who believe that GameStop was being shorted into bankruptcy by hedge funds at this time, and that the stock was worth well more than its price even in 2020. The truth, though, is that GameStop was very much a dying brick and mortar company in 2020 and early 2021. That being the case, I'll very generously say that GME was genuinely worth $20/share on fundamentals alone and that it truly earned its market cap of $1.3 billion in early January, 2021. Of course, GME is currently trading for much more than that. At $150/share, GME's stock price is up about 650%, and that's not even taking dilution into consideration. So has GameStop done enough since January 2021 to justify such an extraordinary jump in its stock price?\n\nWell, the short answer is no. Anyone with any experience in valuing stocks can tell you that, based purely on fundamentals, GameStop hasn't even come close to justifying its 650% increase in stock price, let alone its even larger increase in market cap. It hasn't made any major changes, it's struggling to adapt in its rapidly-changing industry, and it's continuing to lose millions of dollars each quarter. But some people (or, more accurately, some apes) don't see it that way. They'll tell you that GameStop has been undergoing a massive turnaround that easily justifies a stock price in the high triple digits, with many even arguing that the price of a single share should be well into 4 digits. Again, these valuations are given by apes who are supposedly ignoring any squeeze potential and focusing exclusively on fundamentals. They justify these massive valuations with the following:\n\n\\- Over a billion dollars in cash and no long-term debt\n\n\\- Positive earnings reports\n\n\\- Executives leaving companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. to join GameStop, which is paying them exclusively with shares\n\n\\- New leaders including Ryan Cohen\n\n\\- Transition to e-commerce\n\n\\- NFTs\n\n\\- Expanding to sell more than just video games\n\nThere are of course many different apes with many different beliefs, but these 7 points seem to be the main justifications for their extremely bullish arguments. That being the case, I would like to talk about each of these points and why they're not nearly as bullish as apes think they are.\n\n* **Over a Billion Dollars in Cash and No Long-Term Debt**\n\nIn today's economy, taking on debt is almost the same as accepting free money. Yes, you'll have to pay that debt back with interest, but with inflation and interest rates where they are, inflation will likely offset most of the interest anyway. Essentially, if I borrow $10 and have to pay back $11, I can rest easy knowing that by the time I pay the $11 back, it will be worth about what $10 was worth when I initially took out the loan. As such, taking on debt isn't particularly bearish, nor is eliminating debt all that bullish. Likewise, since taking out loans is so easy, having cash on hand isn't all that valuable, either. Granted, having excess cash was never that valuable for major companies--most issues can't be solved by simply throwing money at them, so it's no surprised that countless companies have failed despite having enormous amounts of cash on hand--but it's even less valuable now.\n\nMoreover, most successful companies never keep cash on hand and deliberately take on billions in debt because this gives them what they need to push the envelope and be the first to come up with major innovations. Anyone who sees GameStop as a massive growth tech company should see the fact that its still holding onto a billion dollars that it raised over 9 months ago as a major red flag. A company being unable to invest its cash in the pursuit of major innovations because it needs that money to cover its operating costs is\u00a0**not**\u00a0a good thing. If $20 is GME's starting point, eliminating debt and gaining $2 billion in cash would increase its fundamental value by no more than a few dollars per share. Or at least it would, if not for the way the company made that money.\n\nDon't forget that GameStop didn't eliminate that debt and gain that cash by selling more games and generating more revenue; it did so by offering more shares and diluting its stock. When a stock is diluted, the supply goes up while the demand remains the same. Moreover, each share is now worth a smaller portion of the total company. As such, offering more shares tends to make a stock price go down. That tends to be true even when the money gained from the dilution is being used to finance significant innovations, but it's especially true when the money is simply used to pay off debt and generate excess cash. Realistically, if GME was worth $20 in January 2021, diluting the stock to clear debt and gain cash may make the stock worth less than $20 now.\n\n* **Positive Earnings Reports**\n\nThis is a funny one because GME's last few earnings reports weren't remotely positive. On the contrary, they show that this company is continuing to hemorrhage money. The Q4 2021 report showed that GameStop lost $150 million (nearly $2 per share) in that quarter alone. If you're new to earnings reports, that's **bad**. And that's in Q4, a quarter that historically has been by far the most profitable quarter of the year. Many retailers, including GameStop, frequently lose money the first three quarters then cover their losses with big profits in the fourth.\n\nOf course, earnings reports are very long and measure companies in many different ways. Naturally, most apes ignore the bad numbers (i.e.: almost all of them) and latch on to the few good numbers. After the Q3 report, the most notable of these was net sales compared to the previous year. They made a big deal about how GameStop's net sales went from $1 billion in Q3 2020 to $1.3 billion in Q3 2021 (a 30% increase). However, that's mainly because people were still staying home, quarantining, and avoiding public spaces in Q3 2020 to a much greater extent than they were in Q3 2021. Nearly every brick and mortar retailer (whether it is now or will be in the future, GameStop was definitely a brick and mortar retailer in 2020) saw massive improvements when comparing 2021 to 2020, and many did so without losing over $100 million in a single quarter. Macy's, for example, saw net sales increase by 35%, and it did so while making over $200 million in profit. Furthermore, GameStop's net sales were $1.44 billion in Q3 2019, and $2 billion in Q3 2018. So net sales, the one \"bright spot\" in GameStop's otherwise abysmal Q3 earnings report, are actually down from where they were 2 years ago, and way down from where they were 3 years ago. And note that while COVID is still a factor, it's not nearly as significant as it was in 2020. Many brick and mortar companies have rebounded in 2021 back to where they were in 2019 (Macy's is right back to where it was in 2019), yet GameStop, despite its supposed turnaround, hasn't.\n\nAfter the Q4 call, though, even apes haven't had many positive things to say. Other than getting hyped about the NFT marketplace (which I'll address later), they've mostly just been finding excuses for GameStop's horrible losses. Remember how after the Q3 report, apes dismissed *that* $100 million loss by saying that it was due to increased spending on an aggressive expansion (new call center, new fulfillment center, etc.) that wouldn't hurt future earnings? Well, that's out the window, because now they're saying that the Q4 earnings were affected by more spending on their expansion after all. What exactly was GameStop spending so much money on in Q4? Apes can't tell you, but they're sure that it must be something amazing, and that this $150 million loss must actually be incredibly bullish.\n\nAnyone who looks at the quarter objectively, though, will realize that the loss was caused more by the cost of sales increasing more rapidly than the sales themselves (the former increased over $200 million from Q4 2021 while the latter only increased by about $\\`130 million) and by GameStop's inability to sell a huge portion of its holiday inventory.\n\nIf GME\u00a0was worth $20 in January 2021, the most recent earnings report puts its fundamental value well below $20, and its negative impact is far more significant that the slight boost it might have gotten by gaining cash.\n\n* **Executives Leaving Companies Like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. to Join GameStop, Which is Paying Them Exclusively with Shares**\n\nOne would think that these GME apes, with all their talk of being the most educated investors in history, would know how common this is. Like all employees, executives frequently leave companies to join other companies for a plethora of potential reasons. I recently left a job at a major company to join a much smaller company. Is that because I think this smaller company is going to take off and leave companies like my previous one in the dust? No, it's because this smaller company was offering a higher profile job with better pay and an easier commute. Likewise, there are many reasons that an Amazon executive may begin looking for other jobs at other companies. Most such executives don't end up working at GameStop, but some do. It's also worth mentioning that many of GameStop's executives have left to join other companies. Apes who present it as though executives are fleeing their high profile jobs to flock to GameStop are simply being disingenuous. In reality, employees (including executives) are just being shuffled around as they always are. Some are leaving GameStop; some are leaving other companies. Some are joining GameStop; most are joining other companies.\n\nPaying executives exclusively with shares is also extremely common, bordering on ubiquitous. Nearly every major company does it. It incentivizes the leaders to improve their company, and it's desirable for tax reasons. Frankly, if GameStop didn't pay its executives exclusively with shares, it would be a huge red flag.\n\nThese factors don't affect the stock's fundamental value at all. Again, nearly every major company can say that people from other major companies are coming to them to be paid only with shares.\n\n* **New Leaders Including Ryan Cohen**\n\nLet me tell you a story about a company called Quibi. Quibi was a streaming service founded by\u00a0Jeffrey Katzenberg.\u00a0Jeffrey Katzenberg is an incredibly successful movie producer and media proprietor\u00a0who was the chairman of Disney from 1984 to 1994 before leaving to become the co-founder and CEO of DreamWorks. Katzenberg oversaw the production of movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin (the original one, not the Will Smith one), Honey I Shrunk the Kids, The Mighty Ducks, Kung Fu Panda, Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and Shrek, among many, many others.\n\nAnd Quibi didn't just have a successful founder, either. Its CEO was Meg Whitman. Whitman was the\u00a0president and CEO of eBay from 1998 to 2008. She saw eBay's annual revenue jump from $4 million to $8 billion, and eBay's stock rose as high as 2900% during her tenure.\n\nQuite frankly, Quibi had an all-star lineup from top to bottom. There were successful producers, ex-Netflix executives, prolific digital marketers, and many others eager to take Quibi (a company that, coincidentally, also had about $2 billion in cash to work with) to the stratosphere.\u00a0\n\nQuibi shut down in October 2020, merely 6 months after its launch. It became one of the many companies that have been run into the ground by successful, proven leaders. Great leaders with amazing track records don't make companies immune to failure. This is true for companies like Quibi that are founded by their incredibly talented leaders, but it's even more true for a company like GameStop that's asking its current leaders to undo years of business mistakes made by the people who had been running it. According to apes, since Ryan Cohen was able to beat Amazon within the small niche that is the pet food market, it should be taken as a given that Cohen will beat Amazon at everything forever and eventually create a giant corporation that overthrows Amazon entirely. Unfortunately, that's just not how things work.\n\nRyan Cohen is a brilliant businessman, and he's surrounded himself with many other talented businesspeople. But that doesn't guarantee growth or success. A solid plan from GameStop might guarantee growth and success, but GameStop hasn't announced any plans. Of course, I can respect keeping a plan close to your chest and away from your competitors, but we shouldn't blindly assume that the plan is golden just because Cohen and co. are the ones coming up with it. If GME was worth $20 on fundamentals in January 2021, the mere addition of Cohen and his team does make it more valuable, but only slightly (likely not enough to offset the dilution and poor earnings). The claims that Cohen's presence alone is enough to justify a $100 billion market cap for GameStop are just ludicrous (which makes sense, considering these claims come exclusively from people who have no experience with stock valuations and lots of experience trying to figure out what \"eew eew llams a evah I\" means).\n\n* **Transition to E-commerce**\n\nApes love sarcastically referring to their favorite company as a \"DyInG bRiCk AnD mOrTaR\" as a way to poke fun at those who don't realize that GameStop is moving toward e-commerce. But GameStop being a primarily brick and mortar company wasn't its main issue. Its main issue is that people have less and less need to buy physical games. Nowadays, people download games straight to their hard-drives. Buying a game online and having GameStop deliver it to you is definitely more convenient than having to go out and buy the game at a store, but it's still less convenient than simply downloading a digital game. And a third-party distributor like GameStop is nothing but an irrelevant middle man when it comes to digital games. It used to be the case that Microsoft (a company without many retail locations) needed to sell games to companies like GameStop, who would in turn sell those game to consumers. Now, though, Microsoft can sell to gamers directly. This is more efficient for publishers and consumers alike, so why would either group want to involve GameStop or any other third party?\n\nWhether online or at brick and mortar locations, GameStop's primary source of revenue has always been physical games, and the demand for physical games is continuing to plummet. That is by far GameStop's biggest obstacle to becoming profitable. Moreover, in 2022, transitioning to e-commerce isn't that bullish. In most cases, it's just the bare minimum necessary to keep afloat, and in GameStop's case, it might not even be that.\n\n* **NTFs**\n\n\"But wait!\" I hear you say, \"What do you mean GameStop can't sell digital games? Don't you know that Ryan Cohen is creating an NFT marketplace that will allow people to buy and sell digital games in the form of NFTs? This will open the door for the resale of used digital games! Gamers will flock to this new marketplace in droves, and it will make GameStop billions!\"\n\nOh boy... Please enjoy my 4 part counterargument.\n\n1. Digital resale does **not**\u00a0require NFTs. If you've ever played Team Fortress 2, you know that it's already possible for players to trade digital assets for other digital assets or money. This has gone on in many games for many years, and NFTs have never been necessary. Of course, these trades only involve in-game items, not games themselves, but that's because...\n2. Publishers will never allow their games to be sold on a platform that allows players to resell them. Video game resale has always been terrible for publishers. If 3 people buy a game, publishers will want to claim the profits from all 3 sales. But imagine if 1 person buys the game, then sells it to his friend, and then that friend sells it to another friend. Now the game has been bought 3 times, but the publisher only benefits from the first sale rather than all 3. It's even worse if the company distributing the games (in this case, GameStop) can buy the game back and sell it to someone else. With this kind of system in place, hundreds of people could end up playing a game that the publisher has only sold once. Even if the publisher gets a cut of the resale profits, they would still be taking a huge hit. And publishers aren't the only ones who would take a hit...\n3. Game distributors (like GameStop) would also take a hit from digital resale. Gamers selling used games to their friends hurts the bottom lines of publishers and distributors alike. It always has. With physical games, though, it at least made sense for GameStop to buy a copy of Halo from little Timmy rather than Microsoft if Timmy was willing to sell it at a lower price. But with digital games, supply never runs out. Distributors with the rights to a game effectively have an infinite supply. If GameStop already has an infinite supply of Halos from Microsoft, they have no need for Timmy's copy. Of what benefit would it be to have infinity plus one copies of Halo? This is likely why...\n4. GameStop has made no announcements regarding digital game resale. This 4 part counterargument almost seems like a waste of time because, honestly, this is the only point I should need to make. Do you know what GameStop has done with NFTs? It hired an NFT team and launched the beta for an NFT marketplace. That's it. Many companies have NFT marketplaces and even more have NFT teams, so why should we blindly assume that every major innovation even tangentially related to NFTs will be spearheaded by GameStop? GameStop didn't invent NFTs; it doesn't have a patent on them. Even if digital resale or replacing the NYSE or creating a \"Ready Player One\" style Metaverse (all of which are things that many apes genuinely expect GameStop to do with NFTs, mind you) really were made possible with NFTs, why should we assume that GameStop will be the company to do these things?\n\nIf there are any apes reading this, please let me know why you expect with near certainty that GameStop will beat everyone to the punch with all of these massive innovations because, for the life of me, I can't figure out why anyone would think that. My best guess is that it basically revolves around GameStop being an established brand with existing infrastructure, a talented chairman, and over a billion dollars in cash.\n\nI've already explained why some of those advantages aren't as important as apes think they are, but it should also be noted just how unpredictable companies can be. For example, if I told you 15 years ago that a single company would account for nearly 50% of all online sales, you would probably guess Target, Walmart, or eBay. You likely wouldn't guess Amazon (a company that basically only sold ebooks\u00a0at the time). Yet here we are. Target, Walmart, and eBay had incredibly talented leaders, established brands, massive infrastructure in place, and they were still beaten by Amazon.\n\nAnd, as I'm sure you all know, Amazon is far from the only successful underdog in the American economy. Hell, if you're an ape, you already expect GameStop to be a successful underdog. You already believe that a company can go from a dying brick and mortar on the verge of collapse to a powerhouse overthrowing Amazon itself. The point is that no matter what advantages a company has, competitors are always plotting their next move, and some will come completely out of left field. Even if in a year we really are buying all of our games on an NFT marketplace, this marketplace could be started by Toys R Us, for all we know. It could be started by some random guy currently working in a garage. The idea that GameStop's few advantages guarantee its victory over all of its competitors (many of which have formidable advantages of their own) in every endeavor is just juvenile.\n\nIn summary, a marketplace that allows the resale of digital games does not require NFTs. Even if NFTs did open the door for this kind of marketplace, publishers wouldn't allow their games to be sold on it. Even if some publishers did want to sell their games on it, digital resale would hurt GameStop. And even if GameStop wanted to do this (which they haven't indicated in the slightest), there's no reason to assume that they'd be able to do it ahead of their competitors.\n\nI'm aware that apes have countless theories about how GameStop will do everything from selling mortgages to curing cancer with their NFT marketplace, and I can't possibly address all of these outlandish claims. But most of these theories are 1) theoretically possible without NFTs, 2) impossible because of other forces in the market, 3) not profitable for GameStop, and/or 4) not an innovation that we can blindly assume GameStop will spearhead.\n\nRealistically, GameStop's NFT marketplace will probably be like the NFT marketplace that Ubisoft recently created. Maybe if you pre-order Call of Duty at GameStop, you'll get a golden P90 that's functionally identical to every other golden P90, but you'll get a link confirming that your golden P90 is the *original* golden P90. Activision might even allow you to sell this P90 to someone else (though, again, Activision can already allow this without NFTs). You'll likely also be able to buy \"original\" pieces of concept art or something, which isn't that great considering you can already do that on existing NFT marketplaces. NFT marketplaces are usually profitable, but GameStop may have trouble standing out from the crowd, and they're sure as hell not going to do so with used digital games.\u00a0\n\nThe NFT marketplace raises the fundamental value of GameStop, but only by a small amount. This might have been different if GameStop wasn't so late to the party or if it had a clear way to distinguish its marketplace from other NFT marketplaces, but that's simply not the case at this time, nor is there any indication that it will be the case in the foreseeable future. Don't expect this marketplace to cause some massive revolution.\n\n* **Expanding to Sell More Than Just Video Games**\n\nBut even if demand for physical video games is dropping and GameStop isn't able to sell digital video games with or without NFTs, surely we should be bullish about how quickly they're expanding into new markets, right? If you've been on any GME-related sub recently, you've no doubt seen apes cheering about how PC parts, plush toys, and board games are now being offered at their local GameStops. In reality, though, this isn't so much of an expansion as it is a desperate attempt to stay afloat as GameStop becomes increasingly unable to sell video games, physical or otherwise. A pizzeria expanding their menu to include burgers, hot dogs, and salads may seem bullish, but only until you realize that they're only doing so because no one wants their pizzas anymore.\n\nI admire GameStop's willingness to try new things, but at the end of the day, chess sets and graphics cards just don't sell nearly as well as video games. And this is reflected in GameStop's consistently poor earnings and its inability to sell so much of its holiday inventory. The expansion into these new markets is more bullish than simply throwing in the towel would have been, but it's ultimately indicative of something very bearish.\n\n* **Recap**\n\nTo summarize, GameStop was (if we're being generous) worth $20/share in January 2021. Since then, a few mildly bullish things have happened, which have been largely offset by the many bearish things that have happened. If you wanted to buy GameStop right now at $20 for its fundamentals, it may be a reasonable investment, but at $150+, it's almost certainly not. Of course, that's not to say the company can't succeed. Ryan Cohen might be able to turn the company around and bring its fundamental value to $30/share. Maybe he'll be incredible and bring its value to $60/share. If he's able to triple the company's fundamental value in his first year as chairman, that will be amazing, and as unlikely as it may be, it is somewhat possible. But if you're buying in at $150 thinking that the value will easily increase fifty-fold, without a short squeeze, simply because Ryan Cohen has cash, an NFT team, and some Pok\u00e9mon cards, you may be disappointed.",

    "title": "Looking at gamma levels for the upcoming expirations for $GME",
    "selftext": " Hi guys, I wanted to take a look at the upcoming options chain for $GME before Monday and see how it would affect next week and what we need to look out for and the levels we need to break to continue this massive rally. I'll also be looking at historical data that also point to another bullish week coming up.\n\nAll data found is scraped from various sources and are subject to change based on options buying and selling\n\nWhat is Gamma and how does it affect the price?\n\nGamma is the rate of change in delta, Delta is the amount of underlying MMs need to hedge their options positions (assuming that MMs are hedging correctly). So a Gamma ramp would cause a massive increase in delta and MMs would then need to buy a massive amount of underlying stock the stay correctly hedged.\n\n[Gamma levels for the 4\\/1 and 4\\/8 expiry](https://preview.redd.it/mu9wgy6f1tp81.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf43dcde31fd11e8c7d3d52e04bd74c1c645d5c)\n\nAs you can see we have huge notional gamma at the 150, 160, and 200 levels. As demonstrated last week 160 was a pretty big resistance level for us, usually retail would sell their call options as they edge near the money however with such a big push for option exercising I could see that we push straight through these resistances, especially for T+1 options settlement on Tuesday. Looking at the rest of the chain after we push through 160 there are no real resistances until we hit the 200 level so If we break 160 I expect 200 is very likely after.\n\n(As more options are bought and sold gamma levels can change and we could see a change in the chain)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Open interest for 4\\/1 and 4\\/8](https://preview.redd.it/rlpt3cti1tp81.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83878bc444587d03ec63b1d9b52a3d1111835f16)\n\nHuge open interest on the 200 and 265 strikes and as the price nears these strikes the gamma would increase exponentially, especially for very OTM strikes causing a huge upswing in positive delta and MM buying. It would also cause the negative delta on the puts to be unwound and cause buying pressure as the MMs unhedge those puts that are now OTM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Weekly close &amp;#37; based on historical data for $GME](https://preview.redd.it/7mksjirk1tp81.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109b7e2c11ab57e5b229d1e5dbccfa0b8f8031c2)\n\nAs you can see Week 13 based on historical data is a bullish week for us, January and February are skewed due to the sneeze but having a historically good week will help for a push up this week. \n\n[Daily average returns &amp;#37; based on historical data for $GME](https://preview.redd.it/ohz0np2m1tp81.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26324a27bc0ec26b294ac34488dd1e114ecdb856)\n\nWe also have historically greater returns at the beginning of the week than later so especially with options settlement we could see a very explosive Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nTLDR: We have a lot of positive factors this week that will increase the pressure on the shorts, I would like to see us break above 160 and then likely see a big push to 200. I would expect a big push on Tuesday or Wednesday based on historical data.\n\nPositions:\n\n* 3 APR 14 $150C \n* 2 APR 14 $160C\n* 2 APR 14 $200C\n* 2 APR 14 $300C\n\nIll likely upload an update post Tuesday after the close to see how the options chain has changed",

    "selftext": "Good morning fellow gorillas. It's been 14 straight months that I have been watching $TLRY get it's ass pounded. I was here for weed gang 1.0 last March and have seen the price slowly dwindle from $22.00 all the way down to $4.88. Over the past 4 months I've been slowly buying shares and had $7000 total in shares as of last Thursday. Woke up yesterday to shares being up 30% and figured it was going to be another streak of news bumping the price up for a day or two and then coming back down like it has every other day for the last 14 months, so I sold all my shares to buy back in on the price drop. It wasn't until about 1:00 pm that I realized congress is voting on federal legalization of marijuana again. With the house voting next week, I realized I made a mistake in selling. Bought back in at about 3:00 pm and bought another $2000 in shares. I'm sitting at $10,802.70 right now with markets closed.\n\nNow I know what you guys might be thinking, \"What is this guy, fucking retarded?\" and yes, you would be right. But allow me and my 70 points of IQ to explain why the next few weeks are going to be wild. Ballotpedia shows the makeup of congress before and after the 2020 election. Check the subheading \"Partisan Balance\" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqauma457qp81.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=304f08de52caedd4b0afcf775906fc3231491b8f\n\nLast time this was voted on, the house was a clean sweep with 228 for and 164 against. Then stalled in the senate. This time around there is still a blue majority in the house. If that passes, it's smooth sailing until it reaches the senate again. This time around were looking at 48/50 blue/red in the senate vs the 45/53 the last time this happened. Not only that, but it's been over a year since then I'm betting that time will slowly turn government heads in favor of recreational marijuana. This would open many doors for companies that are waiting on this lottery ticket and I'm betting that the growth of these companies and the hype around cannabis stocks is going to take this sky high.\n\nGlad there aren't many eyes on this at the moment with all the GME hype. I've been trying to save up to go back to graduate school, so if this fails at least I know I was too stupid to go back to college anyways. If this shit goes tits up, I'll make sure my friends have my login info so they can post my obituary to WSB when I invest in $ROPE.\n\nWeed gang 2.0 is on the horizon and I've booked my ticket on the Tilray train. Diamond hands to the moon baby. I'll keep you updated on my positions throughout the week. What do you guys think about all of this?\n\nMy positions yesterday morning vs today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6i6gdyc7qp81.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aeecb3821a9ee7dc500284c6da7de6623e68374\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzd240pd7qp81.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f499b23356a50b0c97dea8141fea5575bbcaa85f",

I believe the bot performed well, what does this say about wallstreetbets. Does this mean that wall street bets is truly representative of the market? Or is this just a fluke that is a byproduct of my algorithm? I believe that the 2020 data would be representative of the market today, I intentionally didn't include the January 2021, because it may have been a fluke and isn't representative of future data. However, that may not be the case, in that case my bot would perform even better in that context. Another problem is with the stocks chosen in my portfolio, since I picked the most popular stocks out of wallstreetbets, it may lead to some bias as wallstreetbets may have only been talking about the stock because it was growing. Does this type of growth make sense for a bot using wallstreetbets for natural language data?",

    "selftext": "When I go to invest in the shares of a company, I think of myself as buying a part of that company.  I ask myself \"would I want to own this company?\".  Often I say \"hell yeah!\" who wouldn't want to own a company that is printing money? (like oil companies and banks and steel companies) and who wouldn't want to own a company that has truly disruptive technology that is going to change the world? (like Tesla and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple did)  But then there are other times when I say \"not in a million years\"  Why would I want to own a company that is bleeding cash and really has no prospects of ever turning a profit?  One where the only way that I'm going to make money is to sell my shares to some sucker.  When I find companies in the first category I buy their stock.  When I find companies in the latter category I buy their puts.  I am long in 60 different companies.  Some of them are old school (value) some of them are new school (growth).  I want to talk about the ones that I have puts on.\n\nIf you had $21 Billion would you buy CHWY?  A company that sells pet food online?  Wasn't this tried in the late 1990's with very little success?  If this company was going to turn a profit, they would have done it in 2020 and 2021.  They may plod along for a while but this is not the next big growth success story even though it's priced that way.  Position 50 x 05/22p $35 strike.\n\nIf there was a company that was making $4.50 per share per year that suddenly experienced everything going in its favour for one year and made $16 per share, would you say to yourself \"I'm going to assume that they are going to make $16 per share every year from now on\" and buy that company based on its short term performance?  I wouldn't.  That's why I own AN puts.  Position 10 x 01/24p $95 strike\n\nWould you buy a company that has never turned a profit despite the fact that it is in an old world industry and has been around for 10 years?  One that suddenly found itself in a position where the perfect storm of tailwinds was propelling it forward.  One whose revenues suddenly increased by 50% but still resulted in a loss?  Would you value  that company based on a multiple of sales when increased sales doesn't result in profit? I own 10 x 01/23p $120 strike. UPDATE:  I MISSED THE COMPANY HERE.  IM NOT TALKING ABOUT GME. IT\u2019S CVNA\n\nThere's a theme here.  Companies that  have benefited massively from the pandemic who have either been unable to make a profit despite being provided with the best conditions possible or have been  given valuations that seem to assume that we are going to be in a pandemic forever.  It's too late to say that I don't want to bore you but I'll cut this short.",

    "title": "Kodak entering the EV battery market; insiders betting big",
    "selftext": "Legacy companies with outdated business models have become all the rage in the past year for speculators seeking to revive essentially dying brands. We\u2019ve all seen the resurgence of Gamestop\u2014the sleepy brick-and-mortar retailer selling a product that everyone just buys online. Similar gains from AMC/Bed, Bath, and Beyond/etc. make it clear\u2014there is an entire herd of downtrodden companies poised to make a comeback. Traders can either sit on the sidelines with their thumbs up their ass, or they can join the party. **Kodak will be the next big thing, with options poised to moon.** Here\u2019s why.\n\n# History\n\nKodak is one of those ancient companies that literally goes back to the days of Thomas Edison. It was founded by George Eastman and Henry Strong in 1892, and eventually became a near monopoly in the photographic film industry. They adopted the razor-and-blades/printer-and-ink business model. They\u2019d sell a camera for a relatively low price, then make their money selling the film. For almost a hundred years they made serious tendies doing it.\n\nThen digital cameras became a thing, spelling Kodak\u2019s imminent demise. Ironically, Kodak was actually the first to develop a digital camera, but the smooth brain executives pushed back against it. The rest was history. Kodak sales declined year over year, ultimately sending the company into bankruptcy in 2012.\n\nBankruptcies are always messy, but Kodak was actually able to navigate it pretty well. It certainly helped that they owned all kinds of random assets that they were able to sell off in partial fulfillment of debtors\u2019 claims. What kind of assets? Well, obviously they had some IP, and a lot of it had nothing to do with their core competencies, so that was easy to sell, and that sale in fact brought in over $500 million. They also owned a [coal-fired power plant](https://www.wxxinews.org/economy/2013-09-03/sale-of-power-plant-at-eastman-business-park-completed), a lease on a Times Square billboard, and all other kinds of random crap they were able to sell off. All told, they were able to exit bankruptcy relatively unscathed. Following the bankruptcy, Kodak tried to rebrand itself for the modern era. For example, in 2017, they developed a [smartphone](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/kodak-ektra-review/) , which was obviously a total failure. It became time for them to move on.\n\nAfter replacing most of the executive leadership in 2019, Kodak pivoted their focus to what they know best: photography-related businesses (film and printing), and chemicals (an industry that goes hand-in-hand with the film business). Now, although Kodak still sells its old-fashioned film to consumers, it is now primarily a business-to-business company, with two main divisions: commercial printing and advanced materials and chemicals.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThe driving force behind Kodak\u2019s resurgence will be its Advanced Materials and Chemicals (**AMC!**) segment. This segment of the company reflects Kodak\u2019s deep institutional experience in chemistry, which comes from over one hundred years in film manufacturing (again, a process deeply intertwined with chemical engineering). There are four main initiatives in the AMC segment: (1) EV battery material manufacturing; (2) light blocking technology; (3) transparent antennas; and (4) reagent manufacturing. While all of these AMC initiatives are set to deliver significant gains in the future, the one with really deep fucking value is EV battery material manufacturing. Here's how it works:\n\nKodak has spent the last year developing a \u201cpilot coating facility\u201d that will provide services to battery developers, including batteries to be used for electrical vehicles. The coating is applied to substrates in the batteries so that the batteries can more effectively store energy. Coating production is currently around 3 million square meters, with current maximum capacity of 80 million square meters. They are in the process of increasing production levels and are exploring other \u201c[strategic relationships with battery companies](https://investor.kodak.com/static-files/31c5a002-cb7f-4209-bc6f-ea5b4f3166da),\u201d as noted in their last 10K.\n\nHere it is worth reminding you that one of Kodak\u2019s first partnerships with a battery developer was with a company called [Plug Power back in 2019](https://fuelcellsworks.com/news/plug-power-expands-manufacturing-in-new-yorks-finger-lakes-region-with-the-grand-opening-of-its-facility-in-rochester/). Plug was itself a WSB darling last year. Plug partnered with Kodak to use their high-speed coating process to enhance their \u201cmembrane electrode assembly technology.\u201d They have used the technology to help build zero emission hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nA few weeks ago, Plug Power announced that it was opening a [new manufacturing facility](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-groundbreaking-plug-powers-55-million-manufacturing-facility-albany)in Albany County. The initiative is intended to complement the State of New York\u2019s \u201caggressive pursuit of economic development opportunities that align with \\[their\\] nation-leading clean energy goals.\u201d The facility will be used to expand Plug\u2019s \u201cGenDrive line,\u201d which provides fuel cell solutions for electric trucks. New York, for their part, has committed to provide $45 in tax credits.\n\nThe economic impact of all this should be obvious.  As oil rpices continue to set new records, the demand for electric vehicles is only going to increase.  Consumers are getting pissed, and their interest in electric vehicles has nearly [doubled](https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-gasoline-prices-have-consumers-thinking-electric-11648027800?mod=Searchresults_pos11&amp;page=1) since just a month ago.  Even when the war in Ukraine dies down, oil prices are not going to crash anytime soon.  To the contrary, prices are expected to explode up to [$240 a barrel](https://fortune.com/2022/03/09/worst-case-oil-forecast-240-per-barrel-global-recession/)this summer.  For better or worse, electric vehicles are the future, and Kodak is positioned to profit handsomely.\n\n# Financials\n\nThe company\u2019s financials already reflect strong growth, as shown by the recently reported 2021 figures. Revenues increased 12% over 2020 to $1.15B. Net income increased to $24 million, whereas 2020 saw a net loss of $541 million. And the end-of-year cash balance increased to $362 million, compared with $196 million at the end of 2020. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201coBvIOusLy 2021 financials improved, 2020 was the height of the pandemic!\u201d Yes, but the trend was already underway even before Covid hit. Take a look at their balance sheet from 2019 (pre-pandemic) compared to end-of-year 2021:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2hoyxrt2cq81.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54dd2c421c61033dadb05fdce8f26c72606a6396\n\n  \n\nTechnical analysis, to the extent anyone cares, also supports the bullish case. The recent price action pushed Kodak firmly above its 200-day moving average, reflecting both short-term and long-term bullish sentiment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4kegoky2cq81.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b348df985d23faea6bb0d8419805f085c0e0ecc\n\n  \n\nAs shown in the TA, the price has already moved up a bit over the last couple weeks, but this is still a beaten down company\u2014there\u2019s a *ton* of upside on the table. \n\n# Insider Purchases\n\nPerhaps most telling, Kodak experienced huge insider purchases over the last few weeks.  Between 3/18-3/21, Director Kennedy Lewis purchased a total of[2,434,179 shares](https://investor.kodak.com/static-files/f64ebe1c-5880-44bf-b16c-197a0647b41c)  at an average price of $5.73, and last month, CEO James Continenza exercised options to acquire [100,000 shares](https://investor.kodak.com/static-files/644bff99-459a-4c02-a6b4-2fbcd423b650), bringing his personal stake to 888,631 shares\u2014a little over 1% of the company.\n\nRemember that Kodak is the kind of company where insider purchases are especially noteworthy.  Flash back to mid-2020, when the Covid vaccine was still in development.  [On June 23, 2020, Continenza purchased 46,737 shares at a weighted average of $2.22.](https://www.kodak.com/content/products-brochures/Company/Report-to-the-Special-Committee-09.15.2020.pdf) Board Member Phillipe Katz also purchased 10,000 shares, at around a similar price.  A month later, on July 27, the company awarded Continenza and various other executives millions of options, with strike prices generally in the $3-4 range.  The next day, July 28 , President Trump announced to the world that the federal government (through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation) [approved a loan](https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/dfc-sign-letter-interest-investment-kodaks-expansion-pharmaceuticals?CID=exit&amp;idhbx=dfcrelease) of **$765 million** to Kodak for the purposes of facilitating the production of pharmaceutical ingredients, sending the share price up over 2,000%.  **Put simply, if history teaches anything, Kodak insiders don\u2019t make big purchases based on a general notion that the company is doing well; they buy when something major is about to happen.**  \n\n# Short Interest\n\nKodak has a fairly elevated short interest, currently around 8.2%, consistent with the general practice of institutions shorting seemingly obsolete companies.  Granted, 8.2% short interest doesn\u2019t particularly make it primed for the same level of short squeeze associated with GME, AMC, etc., but there is room for a squeeze here.  \n\n# Tl;dr\n\nKodak failed to capitalize on the digital era years ago, and it paid dearly for that.  But the company is now in the hands of forward-looking management, and they\u2019re developing products that go far beyond film.  Specifically, as the EV-industry continues to advance, Kodak is well-positioned to itself gain value, as it has recently developed technology to assist in the manufacturing of fuel cell batteries, as well as green-energy technology more generally.  Newly announced manufacturing facilities by strategic partners and massive insider purchases also suggest that something big is about to go down.  \n\nPositions: 10c 5/20, 10c 7/15, 12.50c 7/15\n\n#",

It operates through the following geographical segments: Americas, Europe Middle East, and Africa, and Asia Pacific. The firm offers 3D printing machines.\n* Market cap 1,55B\n* Price:\\~5$\n\nThese days trying to make electric version of everything became a standard and by researching and developing new products you need prototypes. Is there another way to make a prototype than a 3d printer? \" **Quickly 3D print functional prototypes and reduce product development timelines.** \" as they said.\n\nSectors where 3D printing can improve:\n\n* Healthcare 7,38T $\n* Aerospace 1,32T $\n* Automotive 2,62T $\n* Manufacturing 2,13T $\n\nThats just some that come to my mind and just an estimation but can visualize that it can profit from at least 25%(13T $) of the us market(52T $). Even with the competitors that is a huge slice of a cake.\n\nTheir revenue keeps growing\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj9c8dhdykq81.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=181e9ba9d7d8516800e247f76a51cd1770adf179\n\nThey keep getting assets\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i90vj7afykq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c175001aa9e58f984443e92ce80d53925e6e44d4\n\nA huge risk could be at this phase of a company if they have too much debt. The industry average is 57M$ debt with D/E less than 0,7. DM have D/E 0,02, almost 20M$ what is basically nothing, like a couple GME call would have made that in the last week.\n\nHedgies and insiders:\n\nFulop Ric(CEO) owns 7% of the company. Vanguard owns 6,1% and is keep buying since it was 14.90$ thats a great indication that 5$ is a really good discount. Blackrock owns 4,7% and also buying since 14$.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6jwhl1iykq81.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a5240d9bd516693277261f922b0552fa902d848\n\nWhalewisdom.com $DM top ownership\n\nWhat could indicate better that a company is in the good direction when the CEO is buying and just to look classy here is a quote from Peter Lynch \"insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyk8kn8hykq81.png?width=1233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0144a078c6d40c47d449a91fb52c8cc66f79659\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCEO past experience:[https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricfulop](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricfulop)\n\nOther similar companies after IPO that does not generate huge revenue because they are in the early \"build a factory phase\" drop around 50% after a spike. For example Rivian is in this phase also dropping -80% from ATH and -67% since IPO. Other example Tesla in the early weeks after IPO hit 7.30$ and dropped -42% and struggled for almost 2 years to dont get below that \\~4.50$ level.\n\nFor a catalyst I am looking for a new big contract like Rivian and Amazon or after an earnings drop around 10% could be a great entry point for the long term.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this company?",

    "selftext": "The below is an excerpt from GameStop's recent Form 8-K SEC filing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" On March 31, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cGameStop\u201d) announced its plan to request stockholder approval at the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d) for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 through an amendment to the Company\u2019s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter Amendment\u201d) in order to implement a stock split of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock in the form of a stock dividend and provide flexibility for future corporate needs. **GameStop also intends to request stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting for a new incentive plan (the \u201c2022 Equity Plan\u201d) to support future compensatory equity issuances. If the 2022 Equity Plan is approved by stockholders, it will replace the current GameStop Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (the \u201c2019 Plan\u201d), and 8,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, plus any shares subject to the 2019 Plan that expire, are forfeited, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash after the 2022 Plan is effective, will be available for issuance under the 2022 Plan.** GameStop\u2019s Board of Directors has approved both stockholder proposals, but the stock dividend will be contingent on final Board approval.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShare dilution incoming - just like what AMC tried to pull last year but the Ape Army rejected it....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRC's recent Tweet and the proposed stock split is just to artificially prop-up the stock price ahead of the share dilution. RC wants the Ape Army to fund GME's incentive plan - rather than use the capital to grow the business. He is robbing you to line his pockets....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am currently short $GME\n\nEdit: OMG, it\u2019s a stock dividend and not a stock split. The share dilution is worse than I thought. I was initially focussing on the highlighted part only\u2026. I just increased the limit price of my put sell order\u2026.\n\nEdit: Share dilution ain\u2019t no joke. Yes, existing shareholders will get more shares via a stock dividend, but the float will get massively diluted\u2026. An increase from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 shares: that\u2019s a 333% increase in the float\u2026.",

    "title": "The GME stock dividend has doesn't negatively impact short sellers",
    "selftext": "Credit /u/zoamet\n\n**Title mean't to be \"GME stock split in a form of a dividend doesn't negatively impact short sellers\"**. This is a counter of the \"god tier dd\" from the duperdonk subreddit PHD, finance major dd writers.\n\n\nConsider the following scenario: you're shorting GME pre-split at $100. That means that you borrow a share and sell it to somebody for $100. At this point GME announces a 10:1 share dividend, meaning that for every share that you own you get 9 additional ones as dividend. Since the market cap should remain mostly the same, that should set the price of individual shares to roughly $10.\n\nThe people who bought your shorted share get the 9 additional shares through the dividend, all good on that side. The people you loaned the share from ask that you pay them the 9 share dividend. Of course, you haven't received the dividend since you've sold the share short, so at this point you're screwed and you have to declare bankru...\n\nOh no wait, you just borrow 9 other shares and use them to pay the dividend. That means that you're now short 10 shares which is neutral since there was a 10:1 split. That was a close one.\n\nAlternatively you can decide to buy 9 shares on the market, which should cost you about $90 at the new price, meaning that you end up with $10 and one short share left, effectively meaning that you've covered 90% of your position, but you didn't gain or lose anything.\n\nIt's not like a cash dividend which increases the total value of the stock + dividend and creates a demand for additional funds by shorts. Share dividends are zero-sum.\n\nNow it's of course possible that, due to various reasons, the market cap could increase post-split, in which case it would be bad for the shorts. In my scenario above it would happen if after the 10:1 split the shares ended up trading at, say, $11 instead of $10. But that's no different than any other increase in stock price.\n\n**TLDR for apes, the stock split doesn't affect short sellers despite what your god tier dd writer said.\"**",

You had to have been a shareholder as of **April 15th, 2021** in order to vote in the meeting. Note that the email notice was sent to me AFTER the deadline to be a shareholder. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xoprcsw26r81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e4923f4a9b557031aaa184c7bc682294b0a828\n\nNow let's assume that this year's timeline was to mirror last year's. Since this year's meeting is at around the same time as last year's (I've heard it was on June 9th, but could be June 2nd, I don't know which is right), then it might be the case that you'd have to be a shareholder by either April 7th (for a June 2nd meeting) or April 14th (for a June 9th meeting). Unfortunately, you may get notified about this AFTER the deadline to become a shareholder if you started owning shares too late. \n\nAgain, this is pure speculation, anything could be different this year. But I wanted to share this for those who would not want to take any chances by waiting for the last minute and then realizing they cannot vote. I personally believe that this would be the case, and am currently a GME shareholder. \n\n**TL;DR - If this year's timeline resembles last year's, then you** ***might*** **have to be a GME shareholder by either April 7th or 14th to vote in the annual meeting where the stock dividend vote will occur.**\n\nP.S.

    "title": "Deep Dive into the Market Cycle and how it pertains to $GME",
    "selftext": "***First and foremost, I am not financial advice and this is not a financial advisor. I don't know shit about fvck - I literally lick windows for a living. I pity the fool who takes anything I say to heart.***\n\n**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.**\n\nThis post is going to be a combination of different ideas with an attempt at tying them all together to understand what is going on with $GME, and the markets in general. It involves abstract topics, but I believe this is what we are seeing with $GME, and the market in general - at least until a force majeure occurs and we blast off to uranus and beyond.\n\nLet's assume 100% of $GME stock trading is routed through dark pools. We know this isn't necessarily the case, because obviously some buys hit the lit market, but the point in assuming 100% of the trading is routed through dark pools is that regardless of how much is forced to hit the lit market, a greater amount gets routed through dark pools to counteract the damage. I'll come back to this later.\n\nRichard Wyckoff was an early 20th century pioneer in technical analysis. His position allowed him to witness firsthand the fleecing of retail investors, which brought him to his theories of accumulation/distribution. He described the phenomenon as follows:\n\n***\"\u2026all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man\u2019s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.\"***\n\nAside from crime (naked shorting, spoofing, etc), how does one LEGALLY take money from retail in the stock market? By getting retail to buy high and sell low, so you can do the exact opposite - what Wyckoff outlined in his accumulation/distribution schematics.\n\n**Accumulation** = pick up assets on the cheap. Following accumulation, as pictured below, is a price mark-up phase. The price is allowed to run to where shares accumulated are profitable.\n\n**Distribution** = dump assets to unsuspecting bag holders. Following distribution is a price markdown phase, where the people controlling the market behind the scenes take profits and hope to scare retail into selling their shares at a loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Credit to u\\/gme2uranus](https://preview.redd.it/qv0aptjq25r81.png?width=1147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c4739ec6bee3bb79f5ed5f0640c2e0df10d82bf)\n\nBased off the image above, we should be in an accumulation phase - which means fairly shortly we should see a mark up phase where the price of $GME is allowed to run. How does this benefit the \"composite man\" behind the scenes? Well, if it WERE to benefit the composite man, we would expect to see him add more shares during accumulation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BlackRock\\/Vanguard 13D\\/G filings](https://preview.redd.it/9f6b50ys25r81.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fb8d3cf3a569cd4b8c0f7f263bf9e9e0e81dd0)\n\n[Timing of BR\\/VG filings](https://preview.redd.it/kwtikd5v25r81.jpg?width=1577&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ea95e964f0ea203c15ae53f3fb018a1fca6376)\n\nWell slap my butt and call me Sally. So we know for certain BlackRock/Vanguard added to their positions in what is assumed to be a time period we should see them add, so they can buy low and theoretically sell high. But how does this pertain to $GME, and why did we assume that 100% of the buying in $GME gets routed to dark pools?\n\n[Psychology of a market cycle and how it is used to fleece retail](https://preview.redd.it/n394h72x25r81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af6e8c77aa80a704004d8fb62d34a5f05f90f56)\n\nManipulated movement designed to prey on retails emotions.\n\nThis picture describes the Wyckoff accumulation/distribution schematics in EMOTIONS rather than fundamentals - because regardless of what happens behind the scenes, most retail is impulsive and buys off emotions. Do you feel the electricity from UUSB right now? Can you feel the positive emotion in the air surrounding $GME? **THAT'S THE POINT. FOMO BABY! IT'S MARK-UP TIME!**\n\nThe far left of this picture describes the mark-up period which I believe we are about to hit (I can't give a time frame, just soonish), and the far right of the picture is where I believe we are now - the disbelief rally. Keep in mind Vanguard and BlackRock already increased their position. Ask yourself why? Are they the composite man? Highly likely they are, as well as other big player institutions that have enough money to manipulate the markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dang](https://preview.redd.it/z8xlijn545r81.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e6a5eb65d3b84716e255034aebce274c390e992)\n\n[Mark-Up Table](https://preview.redd.it/ceneoy3335r81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0f5d6ec1eb1c259ae36f520f5ae16df7cf2c9d)\n\nI captioned this the mark up table, because a lot of the DD prior using this table has tried tying it to T+2, FTDs, etc.  It's very possible that is the case, but we also have to assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated. If we assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated, this table describes the MARK UP PERIOD outlined in Wyckoff's methods. I don't care WHY or HOW the price is being marked up - just that it is, and it is at roughly the same intervals (every 4 months). Remember - the price is fake until it's not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I'm glad you asked](https://preview.redd.it/ahmvhhr635r81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940ffd7f00a583fa5519e2c5c20b60a5956297af)\n\nIt's highly likely that we operate in a completely parasitic system designed to prey on retails emotions by getting them to buy stocks high and sell stocks low. The people with the money (I'm looking at you, Prime Brokers and Hedge funds), are able to manipulate price movement by routing the majority of orders through their dark pools, keeping complete control over pricing of assets so they can enact these mark-up/mark down periods. After all, this is a LEGAL way big players can steal money from retail in the stock market. By buying low and selling high.\n\nHow do we win, if an unknown entity with more money, power than we can ever dream of controls every movement of the stock market? **We BUY, HODL, DRS.** We buy the dip. We buy the rip. We fvcking hold, no matter how gut wrenching the movements are. We do not give into the psychology of the market cycle. We force the composite man to resort to shorting and illegal activities to continue the market cycle, all while the noose continues to tighten around his neck through decreased liquidity and increased cost of doing business. **Most importantly, we** **DRS**. The composite man has a ridiculous amount of money and power at its disposal, but most importantly - **he (through Cede and Co.), has our shares.** One real share to the composite man allows him to create theoretically an infinite amount of synthetic shares to force retail through the market cycles again and again and again - so long as he has liquidity, which he can create in a million different ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Credit to u\\/bowly741 and u\\/Tokyo\\_Metro](https://preview.redd.it/l4mtgxt835r81.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb64f5d3074ed01ad82c285e8dda6ef3fc6e6839)\n\n**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices.

    "title": "GME - Stock Dividend",
    "selftext": "TL;DR short sellers and naked shorts still owe dividends. For short sellers they pay the lender. For naked shorts, they pay the dividend to the buyer. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t make sense to hold the short position if the split is 7:1 or higher. So they\u2019ll have to cover and it could cause a squeeze that could cause a gamma squeeze.\n\nStock dividend isn\u2019t a normal stock split. It has the same effect of a stock split but the mechanism is different.\n\nStock split: if there is 100 shares worth $10 each, a stock split, say 2:1 will make 200 shares each worth $5. In this case Hedgies etc don\u2019t have to do anything. Life stays the same. Market cap is still $1000.\n\nStock Dividend: if there is 100 shares worth $10 and they want to do the same as 2:1 split effectively, the company doesn\u2019t just proclaim a split, instead they give every stock holder a share. Effectively doubling the float as the same as the stock split. Market cap MAY stay high, increase or decrease https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp\n\nThe reason why this is a nuclear option on short sellers is that they have to buy an additional share to distribute to share holders they short sold shares to.\n\nWhy, that\u2019s the brilliance behind a stock or cash dividend.  \n\nIf I buy a share and lend it out, and the person who borrowed it sold it, I\u2019m still entitled to the dividend. The company will pay me the dividend. But the person who short sold my share either has to rebuy that share (before the ex dividend date) or pay a dividend to the person who bought the shorted stock. And this holds for phantom shares or naked shorts.\n\nThere\u2019s 15M shorts (not including naked or phantom shares) Plus there\u2019s the options chain, which is 10M shares at $200, 15M at $250, 20M at $300 (note my data only looks up to a year so it could be way more!!) So as shorts cover they\u2019ll run into a gamma squeeze.\n\nThe free float is 63M.\nInsiders own 11M or 17%\nInstitutions own  16M or 26%\nThe near other half owned by individuals.\n\nThis is why a stock split it a nuclear option.\n\nIt forces short sellers to buy back shares before the ex dividend date probably sometime in June.\n\nIf they don\u2019t they\u2019re are on the hook for additional shares ie if the split is 2:1, they\u2019ll have to buy 15M shares, if 3:1 30M shares, and if 7:1 they\u2019ll buy 90M shares.\n\nSo I bet the split will be higher than the outstanding shares available of 75M. 6:1 will require 5 x 15M shares bought which is 75M. So 7:1 will cause a case where the shares that need to be bought will be higher than the float.\n\nI\u2019m not going to time when things will explode, short sellers are playing a dangerous game. Friday morning they dumped 1M shares at open:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gLZy29J.png (at the time of the dump, short sales jump 1M)\n\nAlso the stock dividend is perfect vehicle to make the stock grow massively. Just look at Tesla:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lF6WVPr\n\nSo I\u2019m just loading up now, don\u2019t care about the price now for me because I know it\u2019ll at least double. If 7:1, it\u2019ll be historical.\n\n\u270c\ufe0f \n\nNot financial advice I eat crayons and shit blue",

    "title": "\"bUT AMc iS CHeapEr ThAN GmE !!!\" Proven Wrong With Data",
    "selftext": "# Intro\n\nRecently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of \"POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME\" or \"Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?\" or my personal favorite \"if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!\".\n\nAll of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.\n\nHere are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a \"DD\" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcg55iz2zcr81.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad8385b7a0c05247784da5d62ce52bf253744a3\n\nThere are others, but you get my point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Price, Market Capitalization &amp; Equity.\n\nHere is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:\n\nIf company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That\u2019s equity. Price is arbitrary.\n\nIf this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.\n\nThis \"trick\" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.\n\nThe psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a \"deal\" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Proof\n\nI took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yg0ibigzcr81.png?width=1623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2332c19385c9ffba89b1a82da1ce765c18c08a54\n\nThe X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately\u2026 ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Let's do a hypothetical.\n\nIf you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.\n\n(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)\n\nI'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.\n\nAs of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.\n\nNow, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.\n\nAs of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.\n\nIn this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.\n\nIn the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nztqxpt8zcr81.png?width=516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bc5f575d1bd9eb74ae0d7f4b598f4de2935c853\n\nBut price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes. This may be the last time to get into GME before it explodes my tits. But this really wasn't the purpose of my post. I simply wanted to prove that POPCORN is not cheaper than GME with irrefutable evidence. But it's your money. Do what you want. NFA.\n\nWDK",

    "title": "I have finally accepted that I am retarded.",
    "selftext": "I started trading back at the start of Covid. Around the same time I found Wall Street bets. I was only 16 at the time so I just used my moms social security to make a Robinhood accountant. I started off like many autists just buying shares, mostly of things like American Airlines and carnival cruises. Most likely because they were cheap after the pandemic drop. As I realized shares weren\u2019t making me shit I decided to learn about options. For a while I did horrible and went down almost a thousand dollars. Then the whole AMC/GME incident occurred and I was able to make the most money I\u2019d ever made in my life putting my portfolio in the green by over a thousand. I then went on a hot streak and was able to grow this portfolio a couple more thousand dollars, regularly making withdrawals. As time went on and the meme stocks died out, I slowly went back to my old ways of buying shitty 3 day to expiration PLTR and NIO calls almost everyday, sometimes venturing into whatever other company I was used to trading previously. Now it\u2019s been about 6 months that my trades have just been very stagnant and I am making no progress, losing money if anything. I thought a new portfolio when I turned 18 would refresh me but instead I just kept losing. My all time is technically still up but I feel it dwindling with each bad trade. This is what\u2019s made me come to the realizing that I am retarded just like the rest of you and I am most likely not in the 1% of successful traders. Not to mention my strategy is to buy options at 3:58 and sell the next morning hoping for a run in the morning or gap up since I don\u2019t have more then 3 day trades a week. Well with all that said, let\u2019s hope these NIO calls I have for Monday do good and replenish all hope in me that I am successful again after 1 Green Day, and then I will let the cycle repeat after losing double the gains the next day.",

    "selftext": "You all probably know VZ, it's that boring old boomer stock that moves to slowly to ever be considered by us dopamine addicted degenerate brains that lack even the slightest wrinkle. That being said, they have some massive debt like all telecoms do, which they are well able to handle. Inflation being at an all time high and not looking like it'll be waning over the coming few months at least, I'm considering buying OTM calls on VZ (strike price 55 or 57.50, expiring Jan 20, 2023), my thesis is that they will become increasingly profitable since inflation will eat away at their debts while they should have some decent pricing power with them being one of the bigger players in 5g. Interest rates might go up a little but our lord and savior JPOW has shown that he is only willing to raise rates ever so slightly if inflation keeps going on a rampage. In addition, 5g might actually allow them to take away some market share from those providers slower to adopt. Do any of you crayon munching tendydropping loss porn enthusiasts agree, disagree or simply don't understand anything that isn't 'GME', 'MOASS' or 'DRS'? Let's discuss!\n\nTLDR: inflation is high, eating away at VZ's debt while interest rates are only creeping up slowly. VZ might also finally be gaining momentum in with 5g",

    "title": "Broker Dealers &amp; Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers",
    "selftext": "**\\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.\n\n**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs. The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the shares, they own shares in the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.\n\nIt's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read.\n\n# Background Information\n\nI'm rewording a previous post and adding another fund onto it... Going to try and make it easier to understand.\n\n**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a \"counterparty\", hence \"securities lending counterparty\".\n\n[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker dealer (Citadel &amp; others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.\n\nThinking of that example, funds are currently lending GME shares to broker dealers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold.\n\nThe [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar exposure to securities lending counterparty risks as the broker dealers did who were involved in AIG's scheme.\n\nThe broker dealers currently borrowing and lending GME have a [similar exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) to what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic from AIG... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?\n\nWhat's more, the *investors* of the funds are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** loaning the GME shares. So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds.\n\nAnd MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...\n\n1. They are borrowing and relending the security,\n2. They own shares in the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND\n3. Many of these funds contain shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.\n\nHere are the main stats from the first post I made which showed how much GME was being lent:\n\n* 138 of 213 funds were loaning GME shares\n* 70 funds lent out more than 90% of their GME shares\n* An estimated 5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending), and\n* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) in the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.\n* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.\n   * Note: You'll need to see \"GME Deep Dive: So Much GME Lending\" in my profile for the original post with this info. I have it pinned.\n\nThat's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund... I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks at the bottom of this post for additional clarity.\n\n# The Web\n\n**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:\n\n**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.\n\nTotal GME Shares = 1,847,760\n\nTotal GME Shares on Loan \u2248 1,185,700\n\nSee the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.\n\nThe NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:\n\n[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/7lddv0rb8pr81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a13147fbe642ce67f51476bec0636f4497fbcd4)\n\nTake a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.\n\nI wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:\n\n[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/88b90mog8pr81.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56a2fe6803e0f02f217938829139f785e82cc17d)\n\nNearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.\n\nSo wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o67gkzxc9pr81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=502bec7e2d34818c3da305caadf38eec9fe83787\n\nThe ***fund*** has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:\n\n[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/4q0mn82g9pr81.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6188e2ff74c05db37c78b0ed51acbb6cb033eae5)\n\nOkay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and\n\nthe banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and\n\nthe banks own shares of the ETF, and\n\nthe ETF owns shares of the banks...

Just to name a few.\n\nMany other funds loaning GME shares have similar looking securities borrowers, shareholders, and fund holdings compared to the three funds we've just reviewed. That's a lot of securities lending counterparty risk when you considered the amount of funds loaning GME shares (over 5.72M shares by 138 funds).\n\nRemember, this is just lending from mutual funds and ETFs and does not include other avenues for lending GME shares.\n\n# Computershare\n\nDirect Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.\n\nI'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.\n\n*Buckle Up*\n\nTanks fo reedin\n\n**Note:** I have not extensively reviewed all funds and fund holdings, but GME appears to be one of the most loaned securities held by these funds, if not the most loaned, BUT there is a SUBSTANTIAL amount of securities lending currently happening with these funds so I can't be certain where GME falls.\n\n**Note 2:** I'll leave the post with these quotes that I used in my original post regarding counterparty risk:\n\n**The Counterparty Risk**\n\n[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)\n\n***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*\n\n***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.\n\n[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)\n\n*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***\n\n[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)\n\n***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However, in recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.\u2019s have become commonplace. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.*\n\n*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can\u2019t,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***\n\nThe same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).\n\n\u270c\n\nNote: Thanks for your help u/bowly741\n\nEdit: Thank you u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR ",

I therefore conclude the following:-\n\nHe has a new apple of his eye-  Stake in AAPL sold off, incoming 51% YOLO in WISH by EOW.\n\nHe is bearing fruit- Spring coming, berries in season. Calls on BB. Or maybe Gamestop is actually making some money.\n\nHe's bought a lemon- Further evidence towards WISH hypothesis.\n\nHe's cool, like a cucumber. It is well known that Ryan Cohen is cooler online than in real life. By EOY his physical form will be frozen and consciousness uploaded to Twitter.\n\nHe has eaten the forbidden fruit- His recent share purchase of GME has been deemed insider trading by the SEC. Naughty.\n\nHe's gone bananas- I don't know if anybody is aware of this, but recently this guy bought a large stake in a B&amp;M gaming company. I'm sure he is aware that you can download games.\n\nHe's eaten the low hanging fruit- Inconclusive. Either YOLO on penny stocks or sucking on Elon nutz.\n\nWhilst writing this I have realised that a cucumber is a vegetable. I thereby conclude that he is also full of beans and finally:\n\nRyan Cohen is now a carrot top. You heard it here first.

With current pace, the balance sheet may never reach below $5T anymore in this century. There may be a WW3 with Russia and/or China down the road, or another pandemic shows up, and the Fed will start printing money again. It is imperative that the Fed starts QT on a stricter ground instead of taking care of super riches.\n\nFor the greater good, we need to sacrifice stock market for next 2-3 years to save everyone's a\\*s.

    "title": "I analyzed 2,000+ stock splits over the last 3 decades to see if you can make money from stock splits. Here are the results!",
    "selftext": "Stock splits are all the rage - After Google announced in Feb that there would be a 20:1 stock split in July this year, Amazon has followed suit announcing a similar 20:1 split and sending the market into a frenzy. Amazon\u2019s price was up by 6% the next day and Google\u2019s stock rose more than 9% in after-market trading following the news. Tesla is also planning for a second stock split and most recently, GME has also announced its stock split.\n\nWe do know that stock splits do not affect the underlying business in any way, but it is undeniable that there is price movement around the announcement and execution of a stock split. So in this week\u2019s analysis, let\u2019s deep-dive into the world of stock splits, how and why they are executed, and most important\u2026 Is it possible to make money off of a stock split?\n\n**What is a stock split and how is it executed?**\n\nA stock split is a simple decision by the company board to increase (or in some cases decrease) the outstanding shares of the company. For example, let\u2019s say you own 10 shares of company X worth $100 each. So in total, you own $1K worth of shares in the company. If the company announces a 2-for-1 stock split, now you will have 20 shares of the company worth $50 each. But the total value of shares you own in the company does not change. You will still own the same $1k (20 x 50) worth of shares that you started with.\n\nIf you are wondering why companies engage in stock splits, the following are some of the key reasons.\n\n* **Affordability:** Sometimes the stock becomes too expensive for retail investors to buy into. Consider Amazon - One stock is worth close to $3k now. So the minimum amount you would need to start investing in Amazon is $3k which might not be affordable to a vast majority of retail investors \\[1\\] Also there is the psychological impact of buying a share worth $3k and a share worth $30.\n* **Options:** For the options players, there is a huge difference when a stock is cheap. In options, a single contract is worth 100 shares. So for a covered call strategy incorporating Amazon, before stock split, you would need a single stock position worth more than $275K vs only \\~$14K exposure after the said 20:1 stock split.\n* **Liquidity:** Since more shares are outstanding for the company after the split, it will result in greater liquidity and a lesser bid-ask spread. It also allows the company to buy back their shares at a lower cost since their orders would not move up the share price as much, due to higher liquidity.\n\nNow before we jump into the analysis, you should understand how exactly a stock split is executed. On **announcement day**, investors get to know that a stock split is going to happen soon. The stockholders eligible for the stock split are decided on the record date. This is mainly a formality. The actual split would happen on the **ex-split date (or ex-date)**. After this, the stocks would start trading at their new price. For example, in a 20:1 split, the stocks would trade at 1/20th the previous price after the ex-date. From our data, we observed that there was an average delay of 36 days between the announcement day and ex-split date.\n\n**Data**\n\nFor this analysis, I have used the data from [Fidelity\u2019s stock split calendar](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/conferenceCalls.jhtml?tab=splits) that tracks the announcements and execution of stock splits, from as far back as 1980! I have considered splits only from 1993 (due to stock price data availability), and I have considered only companies that currently have a market cap of $1Billion or above. I have also ignored reverse stock splits as the data is too small to be statistically significant.\n\nThis gives us a total of more than 2,000 stock splits to work with. In case you are interested in the raw data, I have shared both the raw data and analysis through links at the end \\[2\\].\u00a0\n\n**Returns**\n\nAs soon as a stock split is announced, there is bound to be a lot of buying and selling activity. The question is, how much return could you have seen? There are a few scenarios possible here.\n\n**Short Term Returns**\n\nThe short term plays possible around stock splits are:\n\n1. You already own the stock and see its price go up on announcement day.\n2. You did not own the stock on the announcement day so you buy the stock just before the actual stock split execution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7ujpf1y2is81.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60912ef1adabca10f9f857da0321abf1363f705a\n\nAs expected, the announcement of a stock split sends the stock pumping with a 1.48% 2-day return when compared to only 0.09% return generated by SPY during the same time period. You would still have beaten the market if you had bought the stock one day before the actual split execution day and then held it for two days (albeit by much less - 1/7th of the gains you would have made if you had owned it before the announcement).\n\n**Long Term Returns**\n\nConsidering that a stock split is supposed to indicate growth prospects, what happens when you hold for a longer time? There are two possibilities:\n\n1. You buy the stock just after the announcement of the split\n2. You buy the stock on the split execution date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51513s603is81.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ed4a28a5e57254549e79a65ccd952219eea34a\n\nBuying just after the announcement would have paid off handsomely with the returns beating the market easily in the long run. On average you would have had an alpha of 1.5% over the market in just over a month.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if you buy it on the day of the split, the returns are not that great. You would have lost money in the first week on average and would have been underperforming SPY even over the period of one month. You would have had to wait about a year for your portfolio to overtake SPY. This is to be expected because by the time of the actual split, the hype has died down a bit and the rallies in price are a bit more uncertain.\n\n**What about H\\*DLers?**\n\nThis is another interesting case where you would have bought stocks on their announcement date or ex-split date and held on till today, starting from 1993 \\[3\\]. Though most people wouldn\u2019t trade by this strategy, it\u2019s interesting to see how it would have fared. \\[4\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6i7py113is81.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74d9f2afdcb64f342300dd6c6bb0169f208a58c\n\nIf you had bought all stocks that underwent a split and held till today, you would have beaten the S&amp;P 500 by close to 200%!\n\n**How certain are our returns?**\n\nNext, we have to look into whether the alpha we are seeing here is due to a few stocks that are skewing the results. Even though I have capped for outliers, I wanted to know what % of stocks undergoing a split beat the market over the different time periods that we just saw.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4506by13is81.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd95395be1c8e00bb00ea578eea899d756fe635\n\nWell, would you look at that! Except in one case, the odds would be in your favor to beat the market if you had followed this strategy. As expected, for short term the highest chance is if you had owned the stock before the announcement (which is not realistic), but even if you had bought it one day after the announcement, you would have had almost a 60% chance of beating the market by the actual execution day.\n\n**The cheap and the expensive**\n\nThe usual rationale behind a stock split is that the stock has become too over-priced, and splitting it makes it cheaper for retail investors to buy into - But the data revealed some contrary insights. Over 90% of the stocks were less than $52 in value at the time of the split, and only 5% were over $230 in value!\n\nSo obviously, the question is - **Was there an advantage to buying cheaper stocks or more expensive stocks at the time of a split**, and how did they compare to the total set and the benchmark?\n\nThe 10 percentile value for the adjusted close at the time of announcement was $3.50 (203 stocks less than this value), and the 90 percentile value was around $43 (203 stocks more than this value). Here are the average returns for these sets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzenccz23is81.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4debdb20bdedbd1c9b06aa887de2acb8c5ee5569\n\nThe lower-priced stocks seem to have a massive advantage in almost all respects, sometimes giving a return of more than twice the complete set of splits in the long term! On the other hand, the higher-priced stocks have a poor record - Though they beat the benchmark in the short term\\[5\\], in the long term, their performance is much lower than the stocks having a lower price.\n\nOne of the reasons that the lower-priced stocks have such a high average is because stellar companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Nike, etc. were trading for less than 5 dollars per share in the 90s - But this doesn\u2019t invalidate the observation. There were stocks trading for more than 100s of dollars around the same time, and they didn\u2019t do as well as the lower-priced stocks. This insight could mean that ***companies with a lower share price that go for a stock split now have a higher possibility of growth than huge stocks*** like Amazon or Google.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe analysis seems to indicate that stock splits are a sure-shot buy. But there are some caveats to keep in mind before trying to replicate this:\n\n1. There are a variety of large, mid, and small-cap stocks that underwent stock splits. Comparing the returns solely to the S&amp;P 500 might not be the most ideal way to calculate Alpha since the S&amp;P 500 comprises of the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. So the alpha we are seeing here might just be compensating for the extra risk we are taking buying into smaller companies.\n2. The stock splits selected here are companies that have a market cap of at least $1Billion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBuying and holding stocks at the time they are undergoing a split might not be an outrageously successful strategy - But it definitely has an edge, both in the short term and especially in the long term. This gives some credence to the statement that a stock split indicates good prospects of growth.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering whether the right time to buy is during the announcement or the actual split, the data shows that **there is a clear advantage to buying around the time of the announcement**, especially for short-term plays. The probability of success is also 60% and above in many cases, indicating that there is something more to this than mere chance.\n\nAnd finally, stocks with a smaller price seem to do much better than stocks with higher prices when it comes to stock splits. While this could just be the compensation for the risk you are taking investing in smaller companies, it\u2019s definitely worth looking into!\n\n**Data:** All the raw data for the stock splits and returns for additional time periods that I could not showcase in this article [**can be found here.**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/stock-splits-data-6LUbbrOfFLo2cjV25RoXaQ/live)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] Along similar lines, to own a single Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway, you need $489K. There are some theories that certain companies have very high share prices because they don\u2019t want retail investors (who are usually fickle in ownership) to own their stock. This usually leads to lesser volatility for the said stocks. One other point to consider here is that there are more and more brokers who are offering fractional shares these days. So stock splits might not be as relevant as it was before.\n\n\\[2\\] This should make your life much easier as we had to use web scraping to pull all the data.\n\n\\[3\\] Walmart split its stock [11 times](https://stock.walmart.com/investors/stock-information/dividend-history/default.aspx) on a 2-for-1 basis between their IPO in October 1970 and March 1999. An investor who bought 100 shares in Walmart\u2019s IPO would have seen that stake grow to 204,800 shares over the next 30 years!\n\n\\[4\\] In fact, [there was an ETF ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOFR/)that bought stocks that were going for 2:1 stock splits.\n\n\\[5\\] Not shown here, the complete analysis is in the data shared at the end.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

    "title": "Ryan Cohen's plan for BBBY and why its going higher.",
    "selftext": "BBBY is going higher and is going to turn everything around. This last earnings report was horrendous BUT there are some interesting clues in the earnings call we will get to later. \n\nLets start with Ryan's letter to Bed Bath: \n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\nSome highlights here. The letter starts out setting the table that management has been garbage with giving returns to shareholders and throws a TON of shade on the CEO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai3z1jnsret81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d23fbe9f6f5bf65c759131362056f5dc8d3d494\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzxqayz2set81.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cdf5d0bba31a4e45b1fccbbd88b7eaf1cc62719\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98h42lq9set81.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11bb2cdaa340fc7cf616d16044bddc99cec360b3\n\nTLDR the CEO is only destroying the company. Returns are down in the market and sales are down while other retailers are doing the numbers they were doing before the pandemic, thus making the pandemic not an excuse for not executing. He goes on to point out the lack of insider ownership: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6lihbftset81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58aad3fa98775c6101c41ee1bd010720c3946f5f\n\nNow for the juicy stuff: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1krk194tet81.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d57db1e13adb77c6a763b14cf73c5c65c372f1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9p6dreptet81.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed4464118c709092810edc675a9f694f106cd42\n\nThe long of the short here is the market is valuing BBBY so low because the company IS going that direction right now. No insiders are buying, the company has little cash and cannot deploy cash to buy backs and invest in its infrastructure and continue to grow its brands all at the same time. THEY NEED CASH. So how do they get the cash? They sell BABY\n\nHow much cash can they raise with BABY though? Here is Ryan's thoughts: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my4juvjguet81.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949c948e64156e84906d0e71df23b046a4a6f08c\n\nHere is what Ryan is saying BABY is worth. Shout out to shark tank for always spamming 5x multiples at everyone when they say their biz is worth 5 million bucks on 20k sales. Going off this logic, if BABY doing sales by 2023 of 1.5 billion then applying the multiple means it could sell for 7.5 Billion.  \n\nYou might think this is crazy, why would anyone pay 5x for a business's sales? Well they do it now. MSFT bought ATVI for 68.7 Billion when the 2021 revenues were only 8.8 Billion. That would be a multiple of 7.8. Berkshire Hathaway just bought Alleghany Corp for 11.6 Billion with sales of  about 1 Billion and that would be a 11x multiple. There are other examples but just know 5x is cheap for a big well known name with an established infrastructure and customer base like Bed Bath and Beyond. \n\nTo tie this all together, here is the current value of the company. The great news is that you don't need to bother looking up the share count on unreliable websites and estimates from yahoo finance that differ from market watch that are different from etrade. Here it is from the company itself on their earnings call today:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5gsso9gxet81.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77e23c714fe7e76eff63027a8485940c90685a4\n\nSo we KNOW there are only 80 million shares out there. 80 million \\* 17.76 (todays close) = 1.420.8 Billion. Funny how the total equals 1.420 just saying when 04/20 is a week away haha. \n\nBUT if we valued BBBY just on BABY alone, the company would be worth 7.5 billion/80 million shares = 93.75. I have seen a TON of speculation as to why Ryan bought calls that exercise as high as $80/share. Well this gets interesting but its quite clear that if Ryan is right about value and they find a buyer, the share price here is going to over 90 which puts all these calls in the money: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az9azeclyet81.png?width=1507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9564a036cd937bee734e5d6ff34685583e5f826\n\nI did the math so your smooth brain does not have to. The total amount of options he purchased were 16,701 option contracts with a cost average of 1,785,257. NOTE these expire in Jan of 2023. Ryan does not give a dam about the actual value of these contracts at all. These contracts exist for exercise purposes only and are not going to be sold. \n\nRyan has 9.4 million shares right now in BBBY and this represents 9.8% of the outstanding shares according to the letter written back on March 6th. Links under the pictures: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s.wsj.net\\/public\\/resources\\/documents\\/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/2pbqvoukzet81.png?width=1216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1560c779e328354dc4b356ff3624c2b462e2b)\n\nOn pure coincidence this is a very similar level to the GME letter that was sent back in Nov of 2020: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/Archives\\/edgar\\/data\\/1326380\\/000101359420000821\\/rc13da3-111620.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ad4xi7drzet81.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb71fefb6d69d081d8c6d0228e31a23389a685e3)\n\nAs we all know Ryan actually increased his share count recently and back in Dec 15th of 2020 after he already made the 9% stake in GME. \n\nNow for proof BBBY is listening to Cohen. This part of the letter calls for BBBY to stop commenting on certain things: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8hd2loj1ft81.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdaf7bb18332a662e8f10a9b9df4fee44d28a318\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5r6thnr1ft81.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55c2876aff197782f6752258d10e938d960df6da\n\nIts obvious that Cohen does not want BBBY to give anything away ever again. Here is the proof from the transcript of this earnings call today: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdysz0v22ft81.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b592965a3350d1192864cdc2f19dc0c63bfffb6a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah93hky62ft81.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f976fc2ce708d58167a29090b9ece7567435c024\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yimz24bb2ft81.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc38ce5c70285fef6839fdc7456b5003c7c41e3\n\nSo its quite obvious that the board and the CEO are 1000% on board with Cohen here on the plans for the future. This being the case, then there is an extremely strong possibility that BABY gets sold and for a very hefty premium at that around 7.5 billion or higher.  \n\nIf Ryan is Ryan here, he will be buying even more BBBY in the future. Considering the spacing of a purchase in August of GME and then a purchase in Dec even after GME moved up over 100% from what he bought it at, this could mean Ryan will buy BBBY even if it moves to the upside here probably in the next 3-4 months. But I would not even be shocked if he made the purchase even sooner than this. \n\nWhat moves stocks? NEWS. If you have been in this game for more than 1 day, you know NEWS is everything. NEWS will move your stock up 20% or down 20%. The market dgaf about anything except for NEWS. Theres an entire NEWS channel dedicated to the stock market, tickers are over tv programs that have nothing to do with stocks. Pure news will drive everything. \n\nWhen the market gets wind there might be a negotiation for BABY or a component of BBBY, this will move the stock, and its going to move hard. The market will have to acknowledge BBBY has an asset generating sales at 1.5 billion with a forward multiple of at least 5x. This company being worth 1.4 Billion is an absolute Joke. Their total liquidity from the earnings call IS their market cap!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.fool.com\\/earnings\\/call-transcripts\\/2022\\/04\\/13\\/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcr\\/](https://preview.redd.it/z6sm4o2x3ft81.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f34d2eb2cb3fd64a5b21a3977e70adcdd3445aa0)\n\nThere are endless good news cycles ahead. Insider buying, share re purchase program, Ryan buying even more, BABY being sold. Even when the stock gets over 90, Ryan can literally just exercise his options and gain another 1.7 million shares giving him even more ownership. \n\nFor what it is worth, here is the major ownership levels if you care to dig further into who owns what:  \n\n\n[https:\\/\\/whalewisdom.com\\/stock\\/bbby](https://preview.redd.it/awy620gq4ft81.png?width=1899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da7aae952087cd321dc584b251b9a9b5882baa91)\n\nFeel free to correct me about anything you find wrong here. Too exhausted to go into Twitter but lets just end it with this : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr25y25p5ft81.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d53bba036825cc8bd47afc04af4e252e886da59\n\nIcahn was shorted by Ackman, held and even bought up to 25% of herbalife.

    "title": "I still don't understand how GME doesn't defy the efficient market hypothesis.",
    "selftext": "# Post too long, here is TLDR:\n\nEfficient market hypothesis sucks balls because GME is being traded around it's SI rather than it's performance. Overall market go poo poo if theory is true once dividends populate. You go homeless.  I go homeless. Death from starvation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGameStop's share price is **completely void of the company's performance.**\n\nThere is no mathematical financial model for measuring (let alone forecasting) this motive fueling GME's price-movement. I can't think of a stock to-date that has ever been valued this way.  Meaning, value found in the stock pertains to new information about it's speculated SI let alone it's SI borrow rate.\n\nRemember all those important ratios that tell us about a companies performance? *Useless*. Even better are option prices--which for most days, are *hysterical*. The average cost for call options usually equal the cost for puts with rarely ever a one-sided sentiment because too many people are assigning value to it's SI rather than the company's performance. BIG PICTURE, nobody knows where the hell this thing will go each day. If people by the dozens are buying this stock based on speculation around information not just separate from GameStop's performance, but a whole other company's activities, doesn't this make CAPM and other models around return obsolete? *I mean, this is speculation on a massive scale.*  Speculation around private information that is no less private than it has been since day one.\n\nTo narrow this, EMH doesn't account for **any other alternative motive besides the company's performance** and or actions tied the federal reserve.  *This is how the market SHOULD work. This is the market structure assumed to be in place not just for EMH, but for most investors/traders.* Price instead is valued around SI populated daily from [iborrow.com](https://iborrow.com) where, once the price drops to a certain point and borrow rates go up, institutions + retail will unload the buying turning returns (eventually) into a cyclical time trend.\n\nThis isn't to say EMH doesn't account for short-selling (ss) or that ss is bad, but instead, *how out of control abusive naked short selling can get which for GME, if true,* ***is VERY bad***.  We'll find out come June 2022 once dividends are official. If it's true, a cancerous bubble might pop bringing the whole market down with it. Mass-wide margin calls will be made to keep banks up afloat which will end in liquidation equal too (maybe greater) than 2008. This would literally justify why wall street was having a melt-down from what spawned in this sub. A years worth of shorting the stock plus more all because Citadel refused to take the L that came from Melvin's doings by shorting the stock a 140%. That and nobody is buying the reported SI from FINRA.  Not when $50k for \"egregious behavior\" are assigned for misreporting data. It's like the equivalent of stepping on Legos for punishment of destroying the economy.\n\nThe markets crashing in the event this bubble pops will likely be the ***least of anyone's concerns anyways.*** This is because *not a damn soul* will be dumb enough to give wall street their hard-earned money again. Not when market makers have the leverage they do to bring down the economy and everyone else's money over fucking GAMESTOP! Markets will become vastly illiquid simply because regulation doesn't regulation shit and putting your money into the markets is now a suckers game--just like playing slots. Everyone from the SEC, CFTC, market-makers and even institutions not involved will all lose the needed trust of the American people which as of now, is equivalent to nicking a main artery. Not a single American will accept \"more regulation\" as an answer for soundly regulating the markets. If the government cares to have a functioning market, functioning economy, you'll need the trust of the middle-class which likely means one thing: Prison for everyone complicit or nothing.\n\nAnyways, this is my ted talk, I appreciate ya if you took the time to read this. I will be presenting this (plus more) next week in front of 2,000+ people downtown Chicago 10 minutes away from Citadel.\n\n(gonna be kinda awkward)",

    "selftext": "So I've gotten a bit of traction in another thread, and thought it might be wise to start a stand alone one re: tax and personal finance for all those cunts that hit the WSB lotto and find themselves in uncharted territories w/ the tax man. (Congrats and fuck you!)\n\nNote that country to country this advice might vary, but overall it should be relatively accurate for your location and you just need to do your research to ensure the exact course of action relative to your area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n0 - I'VE NEVER HAD A POSITIVE NET WORTH\n\nRemember that secured assets mean access to better rates and loans options.  DO NOT eat shit on a bad loan just because you're used to being broke and taking whatever you see.  You are now cash positive, use it to your advantage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 - DO NOT HIRE A LAWYER\n\nIf you are indebted to your government and providing full disclosure (aka not evading), you do NOT require legal aid.  You're already hooped for $$, why give more away?  I wouldn't even hire a tax specialist - you got this - put in the work and save those $$.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 - DO YOU HAVE ANY ASSETS? LIKE A HOUSE, NOT A LAMBO...\n\nIf you have a tangible asset that is considered part of a stable market, you have CASH so to speak.  Owing a house is not far off from owning stocks or gold.  You can leverage that asset's value to secure loans, and those loans will have great rates in the current economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 - WHAT does 2 mean?\n\nIt means that you can leverage your net worth to secure a cheap loan.  You can use assets to borrow money.  You can GET A MORTGAGE REFINANCE, or a HELOC at very reasonable rates (3-3.5% in USA from what I see online for 5y variable).\n\nYou also don't need to limit yourself to conventional loans re: housing.  If your net worth is considerably higher than your loan ask, you can borrow money at great rates in other LoC offerings (tho they will be leans, not unlike HELOCS and mortgages - just saying you can get these by asking - most people don't think of lean based/secured loans outside of traditional mortgages).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4 - REMEMBER WHAT YOU NORMALLY EARN\n\nWhen considering repayment options, remember that this year was a real win, but most years, you'll be relying on your normal salary to make repayments. DO NOT get over ambitious on repayment plans and ensure the maximum flexibility possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk yourself, what can I pay monthly in addition to my normal living.  It will likely be less than you initially think...which brings me to....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 - MORTAGES ARE THE BEST\n\nMoney is cheaper than chips atm, get a fucking mortgage.  Plan to crush it, but if life happens (and it does), you can simply pull back and pay the min.  Shit, if yopu lose your job and aren't over leveraged you can REFINANCE, and use that refinance to pay the payments while you get back on your feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6a - I'M A PANTS ON HEAD RETARD THAT DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING, BUT ALSO HAS NO MONEY LEFT\n\nYou lost your money in the stock market? Remember that your initial assessment may only consider your gains - confirm that all those dumb cunt BB@30 options &amp; GME@500 options that you lost on are being considered in your net income\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6b - I'M A PANTS ON HEAD RETARD THAT DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING, BUT ALSO HAS NO MONEY LEFT\n\nOk so you actually burned it all and have no losses to report, and you owe uncle sammy a few shifts behind the Wendys....yikes. You are a Jabroni, and you belong here.\n\nWell here is the good news - you can simply ask the IRS for an installment plan.  It's like 6% and some admin fees.  You'll be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7 - CONCLUSION\n\n\\#Don't stress.  Don't pay other people to help you (lol remember you are broke af). Focus the fuck up and make a plan.  You'll be fine.  Shit piles of routes to take and none will kill you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that if you owe uncle sam sam a lot of money and have never owed this much before,  it means YOU MADE A LOT OF MONEY.  Remember that and enjoy paying that debt cause apparently you fuckin' crushed 2021.#\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: Not a CPA\n\nAlso - if this thread gets traction and anyone wants to add - please comment and I'll append to the post to get you visibility as I am sure there is more to say, and I just wanna have a thread that helps all the nouveaux riche survive their dinner date w/ the rapiest uncle we know.",

    "selftext": "What's up retards:\n\nI used to browse this sub daily a few years ago, but it has since gotten too retarded even for my appetite.  However, I must return to you today because there's nothing I despise more than shitty, unethical market manipulation, which is probably the only thing that I can agree on with the $GME autism gang.\n\nOn April 7th, George Hill, a retard analyst at shitty, second rate bank Deutsche Bank, downgraded Rite Aid to a $1/share price target and warned of a \"dramatic negative inflection point.\"  This is a great American company with 2,300+ locations and over $24 billion in revenue in 2021, that was already only worth ~$600-700mm at roughly $8-$9/share at the time of the report.  Yes, I know they have a shit ton of debt, but they've been working toward profitability ever since they changed management a few years ago and have been clearing significant portions of that debt from their balance sheet.\n\nAnyways, George Hill basically said in his report that the company was going bankrupt but offered little to no evidence other than \"debt bad, bye bye Rite Aid.\"  TODAY, it comes out that Rite Aid received a buyout bid a week earlier, on March 30th, at $14.60/share.  This represents a 56% premium to the March 30th closing price of $9.36/share, and a 97.3% premium to the closing price of $7.40/share on Tuesday.  Rite Aid DECLINED THE OFFER, because senior management clearly thinks the company is worth more.\n\nIf you don't think Deutsche Bank heard this through the rumor mill and then had some no-name asshole analyst tank the stock with a bullshit stock downgrade so they could load up on shares, then you should check your nose for dinkleberries because your head is halfway up your colon.\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: I OWN A MODEST POSITION IN RITE AID, I'M NOT AUTISTIC ENOUGH TO FOLLOW STOCKS THIS CLOSELY IF I DON'T HAVE MONEY IN THEM.  THIS ISN'T MEANT TO BE A PUMP AND DUMP AND I AM NOT OFFERING ANY INVESTMENT ADVICE.\n\nTL;DR because I know most of you struggle to read: Deutsche Bank analyst downgrades Rite Aid to $1/share for bullshit reasons on April 7th, today it comes out that Rite Aid received a buyout offer for $14.60/share a week earlier.  Deutsche clearly tanking stock to get in on the bottom floor, painfully obvious market manipulation.",

    "title": "The game-changer in mobile broadband connectivity - $ASTS",
    "selftext": "Fellow degenerates,\n\nToday, I will do an update of a DD I posted about a year ago ([first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6b5f9/asts_a_global_mobile_broadband_solution/)) regarding [AST SpaceMobile Inc.](https://ibb.co/8D9BL9C) ([$ASTS](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/asts) \\- c.$1.5bn market cap) and why I think this is one of the most asymmetric risk/reward play in the market (100x opportunity with limited downside over the next few years).\n\n**The company will tap into the $1T cellular broadband market while lifting millions out of poverty and making cellular dead spots a thing of the past.** The current market environment has created a unique opportunity for retail to frontrun institutional investors.\n\nFirst of all, I am still young and full of cum. I have been a long time lurker on wsb (joined somewhere about 5 years ago) and started gambling with about $1,000 in February 2020 (my only deposit). I currently [peaked at $1,031,507 and change in January 2021](https://ibb.co/hm27s7f) after selling $GME at $357. I withdrew about $15,000 to go on holidays and the rest I kept invested (basically 100% of my net worth). My goal is to reach 8 digits by the end of the decade.\n\nI attribute my current result to mainly three things:\n\n* Obscene amount of luck on several plays during an exceptional market environment in 2020 and 2021.\n* Cutting losers quickly and letting winners run (while also being numb to numbers on a screen).\n* A focus on asymmetric risk/reward investments, insane upside potential with a tamed downside risk.\n\nAnyway onto the actual post.\n\n# Finding diamonds in the wasteland of recent IPOs and SPACs\n\nHumans in general vacillate between fear and greed. This creates mispricings in the markets.\n\nIt is hard to argue against the fact that most IPOs and SPACs in recent times have been the result of massive greed and hype. Almost all of these companies have overstated their business case which has resulted in an avalanche of overvaluated shit (HOOD, BMBL, most SPACs, etc.) being fed to the public markets.\n\nThis has among other things resulted in a massive sell-off and extreme fear in most speculative/growth stocks which for the most part may be justified. However, it has also created an opportunity to pick up diamonds in the dirt.\n\nI believe ASTS is one of those rare diamonds.\n\n# The business case for AST SpaceMobile\n\n&gt;Our aim is to bridge the connectivity gap faced by billions. - Abel Avellan\n\n**ASTS is building the first cellular broadband connectivity constellation** and addressing accessibility and affordability issues faced by billions of people all across the globe. **Their solution does not require expensive fixed antennas (Starlink dish) nor a specialized satellite phone (traditional satellite solutions), just your regular smartphone**.\n\n**The Adressable Market**\n\nThere are currently [5.3bn phones moving in and out of cellular coverage](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/data/) as people go about their everyday life. This is an &gt;$1T market currently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\n* usage gap (refers to those who live within the footprint of a mobile broadband network but are not using mobile internet services) of about 3.4bn people, and\n* coverage gap (refers to those who live in an area not covered by a mobile broadband network) of about 0.5bn people.\n\nThis represent almost [4bn people who would benefit from an affordable mobile connectivity solution](https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-State-of-Mobile-Internet-Connectivity-Report-2021.pdf). One cannot overstate the importance of affordable connectivity to lift people from poverty and generate growth in our economies.\n\n**The Value Proposition**\n\n[Image of the satellite](https://preview.redd.it/r81cw0csfnu81.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79cad7428b7c2f35ae04888792a8e9562aacdb74)\n\nIn order to achieve their goal, the company will initially build a 168 satellites constellation (of huge satellites called BlueBirds) in [multiple phases](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001780312/000095017022005212/asts-20211231.htm).\n\n[Phases and countries covered](https://preview.redd.it/aaqbppptfnu81.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=451a91386e8902dd7f2b04c47da9f607909dc05d)\n\nThe Equatorial Phase (covering 49 countries) is scheduled to launch in Q1/Q2 2023, while the rest of the constellation will be launched by late 2024. MIMO functionalities will be enabled in 2025.\n\nThe uniqueness of their solution (compared to Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb and traditional satellite constellation) is the ability to connect to a regular smartphone. In order to *talk* to regular smartphones you need some big ass satellites (Your mom-sized satellites) as well as the right spectrum (can't do it with spectrum owned by current satellite operators like Starlink).\n\nYou can think of their satellite (BlueBirds) as American Tower ($AMT) towers in space. ASTS doesn't own the spectrum and therefore relies on Mobile Network Operators (MNO, such as Vodafone, AT&amp;T, etc.) to provide the right spectrum ([for 2G, 4G, 5G and other LTE-protocols in the 3GPP family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#/media/File:Cellular_network_standards_and_generation_timeline.svg)), basically allowing you to watch 4K porn anywhere on Earth (wink). It is therefore important to see how well they are able to attract MNOs.\n\n**The MNO Agreements and Early Traction**\n\n[Countries currently covered under agreements](https://preview.redd.it/0oi83uxwfnu81.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cca8ce3adb72f5b3d9ad41b75619b0a8c9d2fec9)\n\nThey have agreements for a revenue-share model with at least 17 (more have been found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1tHqty8-LoaN4NkSE-O2M9AJPS2rrKzJ84uTXRWz-7vM/htmlview?pli=1#)) of the biggest MNOs representing more than 1.8bn potential users that can be turned on as soon as the constellation is operational.\n\n[Known agreements and subscriber count](https://preview.redd.it/pgflwjczfnu81.jpg?width=279&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba8960d3e2f88b37d9e34aa73cd1ef7941c35a4b)\n\nThey will be able to easily turn on these subscribers as soon as the constellation is online. Now imagine if they can just tap 5% of the 4.0bn people in the usage and coverage gap. That's 200m additional subscribers which would make ASTS one of the biggest MNOs on the planet (twice as big as AT&amp;T). This is not even accounting for the fact that their solution could attract mobile subscribers from other MNOs. It it also important to mention that some of these companies are also heavily invested in the company.\n\nNow this surely seems very attractive and therefore it is important to ask about competition, this is my next point.\n\n**The Competition**\n\n&gt;Competition is for losers. - Peter Thiel\n\nThere are often big misconceptions about who the competitors are.\n\nCurrently, ASTS is the **first and only** company building a mobile **broadband** connectivity constellation **directly to any smartphone**.\n\nThere is another private company that is building a similar yet widely different constellation already capable of *talking* to regular smartphones (proving the concept). It is [Lynk](https://lynk.world/). However, they only offer the ability to send a few text messages a few times a day (their satellites being to small = less power), can't stream or call someone. They are way underfunded ($10m raised) and have way less MNO agreements than ASTS. On the other hand, they prove the technological feasibility of ASTS.\n\nIt is important to note that other LEO constellations like Starlink, Kuiper or OneWeb are not direct competitors to ASTS. They cannot *talk* directly to smartphones (but need a an [antenna - dish](https://ibb.co/VHfPKvH)). Think of it like mobile subscription vs. fixed internet subscription.\n\nOn the other hand, other satellite constellations (usually GEO) like Iridium and are potential competitors. However, they do not have the spectrum for broadband (aka MNO agreements - satellite operators and MNOs traditionally hate eachother btw) and their satellites need a [specialized satellite phone](https://ibb.co/2PVNdPc) (like that scene in the movie Wall Street) vs. your regular smartphone.\n\n**The Management**\n\nAbel Avellan, the CEO, is deeply aligned with shareholders as he hold 43% of economic rights and is only paid minimum wage. That's what I call skin in the game. Moreover, he is behind most of the key patents protecting the company's technology and manufacturing processes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, the business case seems strong, but what could it be worth?\n\n# How to value this business\n\n&gt;The easiest investments are when you don't need a calculator to understand that it is a bargain - Warren Buffett\n\n**Revenues**\n\nAST SpaceMobile solution aims to target most people on Earth. [There are 8bn people on Earth currently](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). We can safely remove people from China, Russia, North Korea and the like from this equation (about 1.8bn people, but let's say 2bn just to be on the safer side).\n\nSo that equates to 6bn individuals. Out of these individuals you have people who already have connectivity (let's assume 50% of those - GSMA estimate is 51%), some who are in the usage gap (40% of those - GSMA estimate is 43%) and others that don't have connectivity yet (10% of people - GSMA estimate is 6%).\n\nNow we have:\n\n* 3bn connected people\n* 2.4bn usage gap\n* 0.6bn unconnected\n\nLet's assume some market penetration for each category:\n\n* Connected people in the cities will likely not need ASTS service in their daily life, only perhaps people who hike, go the sea, take the plane from time to time or commute through deadspots. A rough guess could be that 1% of people in that segment use ASTS service regularly.\n* For usage gap people, they likely want connectivity but it is either not accessible everywhere or it is too expensive for them with currently available plans. A good guess is that the market penetration might be much higher for these people, let's assume 5%.\n* For unconnected people it might be even higher, something like 10% maybe, as ASTS is will likely be their only affordable option.\n\nThis is gives us about 210m people that would be monthly subscribers to ASTS service. Let's now make assumptions for the average monthly revenue per user (ARPU).\n\nCurrently the ARPU worldwide is about [$8.5 / month](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/data/). But ASTS wants to be more affordable than that (and will most likely be).\n\nSo let's group our first segment \"connected people\" on one side and \"unconnected people\" on the other (usage gap + unconnected gap).\n\nLet's assume connected people will pay $6 / month ($3 go to ASTS and $3 go to the MNO in the respective countries). For unconnected people we will assume affordability is a big barrier currently so they will pay much lower prices. Let's assume $2 / month ($1 to ASTS and $1 to the MNO).\n\nIn total we get **$3,240m revenues a year** (we multiply ARPU x months). This is I believe a very conservative estimate as the ARPU is significantly lower than current market and therefore the market penetration might be significantly higher). Moreover, the company management aims for higher numbers (about $6bn for their 168 satellite constellation) but the truth is likely somewhere in between.\n\nLet's keep our base assumption and move to the next part, expenses.\n\n**Operating expenses**\n\nYou have two main components of operating expenses for this type of business: paying your engineers/tehnicians and flying the satellites. The latter is actually quite negligible for a 168 constellation which can be mostly automated.\n\nThey currently have about [566 employees](https://investors.ast-science.com/static-files/659b5e67-3374-4dbd-a60f-86b59c8eba76) working for them (of which 386 FTEs). Let's conservatively assume they still need to double the workforce to 1,000 employees and they pay on average (technicians, engineers, back-office people) an average of 100k a year or even 200k a year. Let's assume the latter as you want big brains in the company.\n\nThat's $200m a year in personnel costs, we can add $40m for other expenses such as rent, energy, flying the satellites etc. So in total we have **OPEX of $240m a year** (92% EBITDA margins).\n\nYou might think these type of operating margins are insane, but they are quite common in these types of businesses (look at American Tower or other satellite providers if they didn't need to sell antenna dishes or satellite phones). The significant part of the costs are in CAPEX, so let's talk about that.\n\n**Capital Expenditures**\n\nYou actually need to build the constellation in order to generate those revenues. The constellation will consist of 168 satellites as discussed earlier. Management estimates the costs per satellite to be between $10 and $15m. (These could significantly be lower if SpaceX manages to start launching their Starship launch vehicle).\n\nAt $15m a pop, we have total capex of $2,520m. **Let's round that to $3,000m total constellation capex** just to be on the safer side (you know inflation and what-not). This is quite conservative as it is almost 2 times what management expects to pay for the constellation. But better safe than sorry. You can also compare that with Starlink's projected costs of $20-30bn for the whole constellation.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow, the big question remains. How much is this business worth?\n\nYou pay $3bn for a constellation that conservatively generates about $3bn in EBITDA every year (with the constellation lasting about 7-10 years). Let's look at a comparable business such as American Tower.\n\nThey generate generate about $5bn in EBITDA and trade at 24.5x EBITDA (EV/EBITDA multiple). If we use this multiple in our case, we get a Enterprise Value north of $70bn (about a 46x current price - company is worth around $1.5bn currently). Even at a very conservative multiple of 10x EV/EBITDA (S&amp;P500 average is between 15x to 17x, Iridium - more capital intensive and less profitable is 16x), this is still a 20-bagger in just a couple of years.\n\nDisclaimer: this is obviously a very rough valuation and you can make other assumptions if you'd like.\n\nThis valuation does not account for expected growth in number of users, ARPU and expansion of the constellation to more than 168 satellites. If we take a more bullish stance, I strongly believe this could  become a 100-bagger if the company executes over the years.\n\nIf you want other opinions here are a few Target Prices (my estimates are more conservative):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Current Price|Target Price|Bearish|Base|Bullish|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Deutsche Bank|$8|$32|$6|$35|$86|\n|Barclays|$8|$29|N/A|$29|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, a 100-bagger obviously does not come without any significant risks so that's what we will discuss next.\n\n# Key risks that need to be accounted for\n\n**Funding risks**\n\nAs of right now, the company is only fully funded for the Equatorial Phase of the constellation (first 20 satellites) - thanks to the SPAC (with little to no redemptions unlike many others). This phase will already generate significant cashflows thanks to highly profitable business model but will likely not be enough to fund the whole constellation. Therefore, it is important to consider the different avenues for funding:\n\n* Capital raise: this is likely to be honest (as any high growth transformational company - a good example is $TSLA - however Tesla's business model is much more capital intensive), but there are a couple things to consider as well:\n   * First, the shareholder who will be most hurt by dilution is Abel Avellan (the CEO), he owns 43% of the company and is only paid minimum wage. Skin in the game. This is likely to minimize the use of such funding.\n   * Second, even if they dilute the shares by 50% (highly unlikely) this is still between a 10x-50x opportunity.\n* Warrants: they can raise &gt;$200m with the warrants they have already issued.\n* Debt/loans: their business model will be quite stable (typical of the industry). Thus, they will likely be able to get advantageous loans in order to fund the constellation.\n* Government grants/subsidies: bridging the digital divide (bringing connectivity to everyone) is a strong priority for every government and is a primary topic on any political agenda. This will come in many forms such as the recent [$9B 5G Rural Fund](https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&amp;f_number=SATPDR2020041300034) (US example), and many other grant programs in all the countries across the world (Starlink got more than $900m in funding from grants). It will come as funding for the constellation, subsidies for end-users smartphones (especially for the unconnected part of the market), etc. This is also likely to be a major catalyst once the technology/business is de-risked (more on that later).\n\n**Technology risks**\n\nA proof of concept has been provided by their initial prototype BlueWalker (BlueWalker) and the fact that one of their competitor has been able to also connect to regular smartphones from space. Another de-risking event will happen with the launch of BlueWalker3 later in June this year.\n\nASTS is the holder of more than 2,100 patents and patent claims designed to protect their intellectual property. While this may not guarantee that they won't be imitated it gives us some protection and moat around the business.\n\nVery informative [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUm3PyiLU0E) on the technology. Another [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ) from ASTS.\n\n**Launch risks**\n\nAST SpaceMobile does not launch its own constellation. They are reliant on large launch providers in order to complete their constellation (such as SpaceX). They have already [agreements in place to launch their satellites with SpaceX](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/09/ast-spacemobile-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-spacex/) (it explains the recent price movement).\n\nThe company has been very clever in designing their satellite to be able to launch aboard Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Moreover, they are able to launch their satellites with other Starlink satellites reducing their reliance on overbooked Transporter rideshare missions (few times a year) and allow them to book launches way more frequently (almost weekly Starlink launches since early this year). This is very significant as Blue Origin has booked most other launch providers and their is a crunch on launch services since nobody is willing to launch aboard Soyuz russian rockets anymore.\n\n**Regulatory risks**\n\nASTS needs regulatory approvals in every country to provide their service. They are helped by local MNOs in order to fast-track approvals (and navigate regulatory hurdles) and most of these approvals will come closer to commercial service in early 2023. Any regulatory approval will be a significant derisking event and catalyst.\n\nAll of the above are potential sources of delay that need to be accounted for.\n\n# Protecting the downside\n\n&gt;Heads I win, Tail I don't lose much. - Mohnish Pabrai\n\nIf everything fails, with this company isn't worth 0.\n\nI will quickly estimate the price floor for the stock based on three things:\n\n* Cash and cash equivalents as of the [last 10K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001780312/000095017022005212/asts-20211231.htm) are $324m\n* AST SpaceMobile holds a 51% participation in a highly successful private company called Nanoavionics (the revenues you will see in the 10K are consolidated from that subsidiary). There are no market price for that company but they grow very quickly (108% from 2020 to 2021) and are likely worth anywhere between $300m and $500m, 51% of that is owned by ASTS.\n* They hold 2,100 patents and patent pending claims that could have some value (maybe).\n\nTherefore, I think the current floor might fall somewhere between $600m and $800m or in stock price that would be $3-4. A 50% loss in value is much better than most of us here anyway.\n\n# Imminent de-risking events and catalysts that will likely close the gap with the business intrinsic value\n\nNow comes the good part, why invest in the company now and why is it so undervalued (other than being a deSPAC with high growth potential)?\n\n**BlueWalker 3 Launch**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sywdsg3gnu81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fcbbbc13231e8648f123cdf3b8538680c5ca83f\n\nThe [launch](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/09/ast-spacemobile-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-spacex/) of their latest prototype - called BlueWalker 3 (or BlueWalker3, a smaller version of the final design) on which they have been working for the past 3 years this summer will be the main de-risking event of the company. The prototype is fully built and is currently undergoing final testing before the launch with SpaceX later in June 2022.\n\nThe exact launch date could be announced any day but will likely come early-mid May (price went up almost 100% when the launch agreement with SpaceX was announced).\n\nThe satellite will undergo major testing in many different countries across the world and will educate the final design (mainly on the software side) for the BlueBird constellation (to be launched early 2023 as mentioned before).\n\nThis event will be the first major event of the company since it became public and put a lot more eyes on the stock.\n\n**Regulatory approvals**\n\nAny regulatory approvals and market access approvals in are major de-risking events from a commercial standpoint. The most imminent approval will come from the FCC on BlueWalker3 testing (CEO is confident in receiving the approval before the launch later in June - but this is the FCC).\n\n**New MNO agreements**\n\nNew MNO agreements are likely catalysts as BlueWalker3 is launched and as we get closer to commercial service. A recent example is the agreement with [Orange](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/25/ast-spacemobile-announces-collaboration-with-orange/) (&gt;200m subscribers). ASTS already has enough agreements but the more the merrier.\n\n# Final comments\n\nMy parting words will be; do your own DD. This is a long-term play (not a get rich quick scheme). This is not financial advice.\n\nThere are many more topics I could have gone into but I tried to keep it short, sweet and balanced.\n\nThank you to all the awesome people who provided help in researching this company.\n\nTL:DR;\n\n* AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is the first and only company to build a mobile broadband connectivity constellation (read the DD if you think this is another Starlink copy cat).\n* The business model is likely able to target a massive market of more than $1T with highly attractive margins.\n* Overall, while the business contains various risks, I believe the risk/reward ratio to be massively favorable. This is a potential 100-bagger (will play out over the next few years, you degenerate) from where I stand.\n\nPositions: [40,000 shares](https://ibb.co/XWYSgkz) (bought 5,000 more since last time).\n\nSee you in a year for another update.\n\nEdit: typos",

    "title": "Time to short $LYV: Melvin potentially shutting down",
    "selftext": "Everyone on this sub knows Melvin Capital, the famous hedge fund that lost $7B betting against GME during the short squeeze.\n\nWe hate them. And I\u2019ve found a play that both makes us money, avenges GME, and sends a message to the hedgies playing with computers and other peoples money.\n\n\nThe Background:\n\nTurns out with their dreary performance since the GME fiasco, Gabe Plotkin might be shutting the current fund (worth $8-9 billion) down and maybe reopening a smaller $5B fund. This means they need to sell at least $3B worth (if they manage to convince investors to leave the rest of their money to burn), or sell it all (my prediction).\n\nThis presents a play against Melvin Capitals top holdings. Out of all of their top holdings, $LYV is the only stock where the price hasn\u2019t sold off already. This means it has room to fall.\n\nNow, LYV is an effective monopoly seriously benefitting from reopening. Why short it?\n- Even now, the company is a deeply unprofitable dumpster fire compared to reopening peers like ABNB and EXPE. They have debt to the tits on their books. But because of the reopening halo (or price manipulation), the stock price hasnt budged while the rest of the market took a dump.\n\n- Melvin\u2019s position is simply so large that them selling a part can move the markets.\n\n- A couple of folks in DC are really looking at LYV, and lobbying the Biden admin to open an anti-trust investigation.\n\n- Literally a new variant coming out and cancelling concerts for a few weeks can fuq up the cash flow for Live Nation.\n\n\nMelvin has lost its clients half their money. Even a gust of wind can cause the fund to pull a full Archegos and liquidate. When they do, all their top holdings will tank like BIDU, VIAC, and FTCH did in February 2021. \n\nThe Play: \n\nI recommend going short, either by short-selling the $LYV stock (but covering with June $120C), or by buying the June $100P. I see $LYV going as low as $80-85 once Melvin begins liquidating.\n\nOf course, Covid might disappear tomorrow, in which case reopening stocks may irrationally moon. Therefore, as a hedge, I recommend going long a basket of blue chip reopening/travel stocks (preferably not already owned by Melvin). This keeps your exposure to the sector at close to neutral while we bide out this play to vulture pick Melvin Capital\u2019s carcass.\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: how do you know Melvin needing to liquidate actually moves the price of these tickers?\n\nA: during the 2021 GME Squeeze, L Brands, one of Melvins top long holding at the time, dropped significantly on no news. This suggests that Melvin is accustomed to open-market selling.\n\n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/gabe-plotkin-melvin-capital-reboots-145220888.html",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nA few days ago I posted my views on GME but it apparently got deleted I don't know why, whatever be it I'm back with another Technical analysis of mine, would love to hear what you guys have to say about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScript Name: AstraZeneca PLC\n\nTICK: AZN\n\nView: Bullish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly timeframe view -\n\n1. AstraZeneca had a breakout with increasing volumes recently and subsequently, it hit a new all-time high.\n2. After hitting the all-time high AZN fell for 2 weeks straight and this week it has taken support from the previous resistance levels, thus confirming that the resistance has now become a support zone. (The volume confirmation solidifies this view).\n\n[AZN on Weekly Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/83w3l7y26gw81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37639726a7af0306d69e1daef77c337f2c799f78)\n\nDaily timeframe view -\n\n1. If we slap in a Fibonacci from the last low to the recent high we can see that the price has taken support from 38.2% levels.\n2. Not only that, but we can also see that the 38.2% level coincides with the 50EMA, not to be mentioned that it also coincides with the weekly timeframe support zone.\n3. It is safe to say that if the market remains bullish AZN can surely hit a new all-time high very soon.\n\n[AZN on Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/ysd4g8f67gw81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c053e4b7998b2e3fdd32e440510618e2a2e5fcd)\n\nPoints to be noted :\n\n1. It might seem that my technical analysis on AZN is a bit late since in the last trading session it already had a good bullish movement, but what I believe is that yesterday's movement might give a little pullback since it might have been due to the results.\n\nDisclaimers :\n\n1. Please perform your own analysis before taking any positions.\n2. Please let me know if I'm violating any sub rules by posting such analysis. (Asked since my last analysis got deleted).\n\nTLDR:\n\nI'm bullish on AstraZeneca.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank You, happy trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: Entered at the opening today since it was a gap down.",

    "selftext": "Hello retards, how retarded are we today ?\n\nI wanted to speak on some questions and see if i could attract some with enough wrinkles to offer some insightful information. \n\nSo as you may of heard by now (if not where the fuck have you been) on the 2nd of June the beloved company of GameStop will be holding the annual shareholders meeting to reveal the vote on wether the shareholders have approved the 1 billions shares to be issued so the company can go ahead with the dividend. The ratio of the dividend/split is not yet clear. \n\nBefore you say it. Yes i know they could issue the dividend without shareholder approval, save your co2. \n\nAnyway so my questions may come of extremely smooth so bare with me. I will number my questions in order to keep everything smooth \n(no pun intended \ud83e\udde0) \n\n1) If $GME does for exmaple a 7:1 split (in the form of a dividend) that would mean the price now $125 will go to $17.8. We all now this poor stock has been shorted \ud83e\ude73 more than danny DeVito to bring the price lower, but wouldn\u2019t a price of $17 after the split be easier for the sharks to bring this bitch to $0 or if not $0, never let it reach the $100 range again ? \n\n2) from my understanding the point of this split is that its more appealing to attract more buyers at a lower price point, hence more people buying and causing the price to go right back up. But if all orders are being routed through dark pools, how will the price go up even if a shit ton of people buy? \n\n3) the company is asking for permission to bring the total shares from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000, isn\u2019t this the same as share dilution, if not what is the difference ? \n\n4) do the shorts really have to deliver those dividends to shareholders? Coz bunch-a people are saying this. \n\n5) will this split cause them to close ? \n\n6) how bullish are you ? \n\nGracias.",

    "title": "The Uranium Papers",
    "selftext": "# A Short Introduction\n\nTo begin, I will give a brief summary of where we have been from the beginning of this year until now. Hopefully, this will catch you up to speed\u2026should you wish to continue with this trade. I will also try to write this in both regular normal human tongue and in WSB degenerate lingo. For some of the especially smooth-brained imbeciles out there, I ran out of crayons months ago, I\u2019ll try to include some pictures and smaller words out of common courtesy.\n\nFYI - I will be posting this on both Reddit and Twitter. I am not going to dive into every nook and cranny. I will also ask questions along the way for you to ponder. It will be tough for a lot of you, as it is written in such a way that a high schooler can understand...ironically the furthest education most of those reading this would have achieved. I recommend finding a few friends and combining the remaining brain cells you have to power through this...and preferably not someone that actually believes a trillion-dollar order could be filled.\n\nThis is going to be an overview and I have the utmost faith any questions you might have, can and will be answered by fellow Uranium Assholes - a term bestowed upon us by a dipshit who tweets homophobic slurs. But I digress. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n# Background\n\nSince the beginning of the year, several events have transpired that have shaped the Uranium space. These are some of the main ones, as well as a telling clue as to why I believe this is going to be the trade to be in for the next 12-24 months. I will begin with the CCJ earnings call, as their next earnings call is on Thursday 5/5/2022\u2026or more affectionately known as - Cameco de Mayo\n\n1. **CCJ earnings call** \\- Taken place on Feb 9th, we learned that Cameco had begun long-term contracts. Tim Gitzel (CEO), who is relatively mild-mannered and conservative during these calls, was noticeably much more bullish in tone than normal. He explained that they had termed out 30 million lbs of uranium in 2021, as well as improving fundamentals. Further explaining, that in January ALONE, they had added 40million lbs of long-term contracts\u2026likely attributable to the unrest in Kazakhstan in January. They also announced that they would be restarting McArthur River and Key Lake Mill. Restarting these would only be done under one scenario\u2026the bear market is over and the bull market had begun. This marked the turnaround of the Uranium stocks, which had since been in a large pullback. For those who do not know, this space is notorious for vicious pullbacks and ripping rallies\u2026the latter is why I am writing this today. Take a quick look at all the stocks in the Uranium space for the days/weeks following that call\u2026I would look closer at the ones that are the most easily investable and liquid, should Jim Cramer declare world peace and state a melt-up is coming\u2026seriously, how that guy is actually allowed to talk and give financial advice is insane. Part of me thinks he takes his advice from David Hunter. Again, I digress\u2026moving on.\n\nA quick summary of the call (\\~10 pages), the actual transcript (page 10 is the LT contracting piece) can be read below, as well as more in depth (90 minutes) actual call via the links below\u2026total \\~100 pages and 90 minutes\u2026how deep you want to go is up to you.\n\n[https://greenstocknews.com/news/nyse/ccj/cameco-announces-2021-financial-results-50-increase-to-2022-dividend-aligned-with-70-million-pounds-of-long-term-contracting-and-improving-market-fundamentals-next-phase-of-its-supply-discipline-begins-while-awaiting-further-market-improvements](https://greenstocknews.com/news/nyse/ccj/cameco-announces-2021-financial-results-50-increase-to-2022-dividend-aligned-with-70-million-pounds-of-long-term-contracting-and-improving-market-fundamentals-next-phase-of-its-supply-discipline-begins-while-awaiting-further-market-improvements)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312522081448/d328590dex993.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312522081448/d328590dex993.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cameco.com/invest/events-presentations/2021-q4-conference-call-and-webcast](https://www.cameco.com/invest/events-presentations/2021-q4-conference-call-and-webcast)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Kazakhstan** \\- Around the beginning of January, civil unrest began to take place in Kazakhstan. This is of particular interest to Uranium investors, as a majority of the world\u2019s uranium is mined there\u2026approximately \\~40% (link below). This, along with other supply/demand fundamentals (will be brought up later), is likely why Cameco had such an insane earnings call, as well as many stocks doubling and nearly tripling since then. The unrest here is notable because the magnitude of how much this country contributes total uranium supply worldwide. It would be akin to OPEC oil supply being in question (\\~40%...link below). In fact, Russia had to come in and save the day from all the turmoil (more on that later). Now, if you were a utility company (who actually uses the uranium) and you have a risk management or fuel buying team, you probably are going to want to make sure you do not run into any supply disruptions that could screw you over. I would likely look to de-risk the scenario by diversifying why I obtained future uranium supply, signing long term contracts (You can count on one hand the actual amount of uranium producers out there\u2026reminder, we are coming out of a BEAR market), and likely keeping a close eye on the situation moving forward.\n\nWhat would you do? Re-read the CCJ section above and I think you likely understand why all that LT contracting occurred. You can also watch over some of the interviews with their CEO Askar Batyrbayev around that time frame. They are not inspiring in confidence that the situation was fully resolved and disruptions would not be felt.\n\n[https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx)\n\n[https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/supply-opec.php#:\\~:text=OPEC%20member%20countries%20produce%20about,the%20total%20petroleum%20traded%20internationally](https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/supply-opec.php#:~:text=OPEC%20member%20countries%20produce%20about,the%20total%20petroleum%20traded%20internationally).\n\n1. **Ukraine and Russia** \\- Right after unrest in Kazakhstan, the Ukraine/Russia war began. Amongst many other commodities, this is of particular importance to the uranium space because of both Russia\u2019s proximity to Kazakhstan (risk management and CSTO potentially dragging Kazakhstan into the conflict - a bit of a rabbit hole there\u2026stick to the next bit) and Russia\u2019s role in the world\u2019s uranium enrichment process - accounting for nearly 40% of it. This is essentially the end product of uranium that nuclear reactors use (link and source of commentary from president of a nuclear fuel market analysis firm are below\u2026only a few pages). Since this end product is exactly what nuclear reactors use, a disruption at this point of the fuel cycle can cause MASSIVE upstream effects\u2026 which is referred to as overfeeding. Rather than try to explain it here, there is a short video (20 minutes) that I will link below. It also includes Mark Nelson, a strong, well-spoken advocate for nuclear energy. He was also EXTREMELY active on Twitter during the Chernobyl FUD fiasco that took place when there was fighting around that reactor. MSM pumped up there could be another meltdown or nuclear accident\u2026all for theatrical purposes IMO and it is a bunch of BS. New reactors are built to withstand more than bullets\u2026in fact jets (link below)...I digress.\n\nWhether you watch the video or not, you should know that overfeeding basically means MORE uranium is needed to make the end product that nuclear reactors use\u2026as we say in the uranium space NOT BEARISH\n\nIn degenerate terms - 1+1 =2 but in overfeeding, 1+1+1+1+1 = 2\n\nThis is about the most dumbed-down version I feel most of you will understand\u2026because of your background at Wendys\n\nNormally, it takes 4 chicken tendies to make a 4-piece chicken tendie meal\u2026now imagine it takes 10\u2026or 12\u2026or 16. That is a whole heck of a lot more chicken tendies that are going to be needed\u2026this is almost about what it is like\n\nPS - you should watch the video \u2026 this guy\u2019s mustache gives Ron Jeremys a run for the money\n\n[https://www.shovel-stocks.com/post/interview-the-nuclear-fuel-cycle-uranium-enrichment-mark-nelson-radiant-energy-fund-1-2](https://www.shovel-stocks.com/post/interview-the-nuclear-fuel-cycle-uranium-enrichment-mark-nelson-radiant-energy-fund-1-2)\n\n[https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/30/russias-role-in-worlds-nuclear-energy-industry-prompts-calls-to-up-u-s-uranium-production/](https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/30/russias-role-in-worlds-nuclear-energy-industry-prompts-calls-to-up-u-s-uranium-production/)\n\n[https://interestingengineering.com/crashed-jet-nuclear-reactor-test](https://interestingengineering.com/crashed-jet-nuclear-reactor-test)\n\nYou may have noticed that energy security is fast becoming a hot issue and that this war is not looking like it is going to resolve soon. There are numerous factors that are at play and continue to be at play from this war that is extremely bullish for this trade\u2026each one could certainly be elaborated on but I am keeping this brief. In all likelihood, a majority of you probably could not make it past the first paragraph, let alone this point.\n\n* Sanctions - The US and others have been sanctioning Russia left and right. I joked that they were going to ban skull bongs with built-in police scanners at one point because of the dumb shit that they had been sanctioning IMO. However, with Congress back in session, Manchin (read: most powerful Democrat in Congress right now) has come out and supported a ban of Russian uranium. The act he supports also contains a strategic uranium reserve. There are a number of other listed proposed legislation with BIPARTISAN support all around. Links are below - the full text of all of these is in the hundreds\n* **Sanction update - As I update this (5/3), the EU is looking to involve Uranium in the most recent round of sanctions this current week - this announcement could occur as early as Wednesday (today).** \n* Question to ponder - With midterms right around the corner and a full-blown energy crisis underway (been to the pump lately?), things are going to get worse before they get better (See Youtube video below for visual representation). The everything-is-Putin\u2019s fault card is already being played\u2026in fact, he was blamed for crazy blowout inflation numbers (CPI)...even when the numbers reported could not have possibly included Putin because the war had not even started. If the energy crisis is already fully underway (irrespective of who is at fault), it would be easy to score political brownie points by being anti-Russia with anything.\n* Question 1- Think of the backlash that could occur prior to midterms if your opponent comes out as anti-Russia and says you aren\u2019t supporting the now bipartisan bills they are putting out against Russia\u2026does that look good on MSM and at the polls?\n* Question 2 - Manchin is the cog that makes the Build Back Better bill actually pass - his voice matters more than most\u2026and he\u2019s the ranking member of the Energy Committee - he\u2019s publicly for a ban on Russian Uranium and he is pro-nuclear\u2026think that Biden and Co might want to appease him for that vote with some easy concessions?\n\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4064/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4064/text)\n\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3978/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&amp;r=2&amp;s=2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3978/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&amp;r=2&amp;s=2)\n\n\u200b\u200b[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7222/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&amp;r=4&amp;s=1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7222/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&amp;r=4&amp;s=1)\n\n [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/europe-prepares-fresh-russia-sanctions-as-us-warns-moscow-plans-to-annex-parts-of-east-ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/europe-prepares-fresh-russia-sanctions-as-us-warns-moscow-plans-to-annex-parts-of-east-ukraine)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi22Vkie7EM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi22Vkie7EM)\n\n1. **SWU**  \\- We have begun to see the effects of Russian bans on the enrichment cycle - clearly, folks are moving away from them\u2026and in doing so, costs are going to go up\u2026I think this is best explained in the video I will link below.\n\nI highly recommend you read and watch the video from Uranium Insider below starting at the 8:25 mark. This explains the enrichment story unfolding\u2026there was a jump from $72 \u2026to\u2026$120. Which, I believe, is one of, if not, the greatest jump in price EVER.\n\nThis price is a leading indicator of the future SPOT price of Uranium.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPZqG\\_WarG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPZqG_WarG8)\n\nWhether the aforementioned sanctions occur or not, de-facto ones are already in place. It is clear that a move away from Russian sourced enrichment fuel is here. In fact, Urenco USA was just starting to post that they are looking to hire more folks\u2026they are involved in supplying enrichment services and fuel cycle products in the USA\n\nThat is essentially a shortened version of 2022 in the Uranium space. If you want some videos to watch, I linked below the Youtube video to Uranium Insider where I think you should start watching. I would avoid watching the price action and just grab the daily updates to have the story told to you a little more in-depth than the writings above. The episode is 58\u2026there are now 112 of them. I estimate this is likely a good 10+ hours of content for you to watch, depending on if you want to see the price action and commentary on that as well.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZBlnk1yph4&amp;t=659s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZBlnk1yph4&amp;t=659s)\n\nFor a more in depth in-depth look at what has been going on, I suggest you check out some of Napalm's work. He has A LOT of content/posts and he is quite descriptive. Bring some coffee. The link below to one of them.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/ths6ri/the\\_latest\\_signes\\_of\\_operational\\_license/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/ths6ri/the_latest_signes_of_operational_license/)\n\nFor a shit post that describes a bit of this\u2026he is a video I put together\u2026great for those that have difficulties with words that have more than a few syllables\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u612ck/an\\_easter\\_meme\\_for\\_u\\_degenerates/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u612ck/an_easter_meme_for_u_degenerates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n# New Builds, Extensions, and Restarts\n\nThis section is going to go over just what the title states. We will begin with what we know and move toward the more opaque situations.\n\n1. **New Builds** \\- There are several stories coming out here but the main ones of interest a the moment should be from China, France,  India, the UK, and India.\n\nChina announced plans to construct 150 new reactors - they obviously believe their future is going to run with nuclear power.\n\nFrance - Macron won the election\u2026he is ditching plans to close down 12 reactors and potentially increase the new building of 14 reactors.\n\nIndia is going to build 10 new reactors over the next three years\n\nThe UK is planning on 8 new reactor builds - they are planning on adding an additional one each year until the year 2030.\n\nSouth Korea - the recent election saw a pro-nuclear president take office\u2026they play on resuming the building of two new ones and reactivating of suspended ones.\n\nSomething to ponder - With everything going on in the Uranium world and world in general, what do you think countries that are going to spend HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of $$$ on new reactors are going to do to the Uranium market. My guess is that as commodities grow more and more scarce/in demand, energy becomes more and more valuable, I believe that they will begin to stockpile strategic reserves. Most nuclear reactors, typically store a few years' supply out in advance. Those current supplies are now dwindling and restocking is going to be needed. I think the near-term builders will scoop up supply and the more savvy Chinese (with their five-year plans and 4D chess moves) will stockpile it in mass quantities.\n\nWhat would you do in this case to ensure your hundreds of billions of dollars worth of nuclear reactor investment was able to be put to use\u2026buy in advance\u2026or wait around with all this news swirling about?\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s)\n\n[https://www.montelnews.com/news/1315204/macron-wins-election-vows-to-boost-nuclear-renewables](https://www.montelnews.com/news/1315204/macron-wins-election-vows-to-boost-nuclear-renewables)\n\n[https://www.cnet.com/science/why-the-us-should-learn-from-chinas-nuclear-power-expansion/](https://www.cnet.com/science/why-the-us-should-learn-from-chinas-nuclear-power-expansion/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doosan-heavy-rallies-on-nuclear-energy-hopes-under-new-south-korean-president-271646987413?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doosan-heavy-rallies-on-nuclear-energy-hopes-under-new-south-korean-president-271646987413?mod=newsviewer_click)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61010605#:\\~:text=It%20also%20confirmed%20advanced%20plans,nuclear%20reactors%2C%20or%20possibly%20both](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61010605#:~:text=It%20also%20confirmed%20advanced%20plans,nuclear%20reactors%2C%20or%20possibly%20both).\n\n1. **Extensions** \\- There are some extensions listed above but we can look at the ones that are specific to the US here. The Department of Energy is planning on spending $6 billion to prevent nuclear power plants from closing down. There are several around the USA that have the public\u2019s eye. I will mention Palisades and Diablo here.\n\nHere is the connect the dots part of this DD\u2026Palisades is a nuclear reactor that is located in Michigan. Our current Secretary of Energy is Jennifer Granholm - former two-term governor of Michigan who is pro-nuclear energy. Palisades just applied for federal aid to help prevent the shutdown. That shutdown is supposed to occur in late May, barring intervention.\n\nWhat do you think might occur here?\n\nIf there is more interest, Michigan is near and dear to my heart. I would be willing to follow up on this with another post. I digress.\n\nThe other reactors in the US I believe that will see extensions are\u2026every single one that applies for aid. The main reasons these were shutdown were from cheaper natural gas (which lately has been going limit up), costs of major repairs (federal aid alleviates this), and operating losses due to cheaper electricity prices (not anymore). The writing on the wall for the US right now is a green and electric future\u2026to be paid for in part by US taxpayers.\n\nAs I am writing this, there was a major development in the state of California. Diablo Canyon, California\u2019s last remaining nuclear power plant may be seeing an extension.\n\nI have placed two links below to this news. Admittedly, I know more about the Palisades situation than the Diablo Canyon one. As such, I would encourage you to follow the few folks that have been in the trenches in regard to this situation for years upon years.\n\nVia Twitter, they have some excellent recent threads and thoughts on this situation. Far more in-depth than I will go here.\n\nMark Nelson u/energybants\n\nChris Keefer u/Dr_keefer\n\nIsabelle u/isabelleboemeke\n\nMichael Shellenberger u/ShellenbergerMD (one great thread on it\u2026lots of political talk too\u2026not going to go into where I stand with everything, just stating he had a solid thread on this matter - no more, no less.)\n\nMoving forward\u2026\n\nHere is a thought to ponder - How are we going to power all these new electric vehicles without nuclear energy in the United States (and the world)?\n\nConsider this - the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow (and sometimes when it does, it kills hundreds of bald eagles), and water doesn\u2019t always flow for hydro\u2026shit, sometimes these things just go straight to the shitter (Read: Texas winter when wind turbines froze\u2026and people were without power\u2026in the ENERGY CAPITAL OF THE USA)\n\n[https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-to-offer-6-billion-to-keep-struggling-nuclear-reactors-online/618919/#:\\~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Energy%20](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-to-offer-6-billion-to-keep-struggling-nuclear-reactors-online/618919/#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Energy%20)(DOE,of%20intent%20published%20last%20week.\n\n[https://www.hollandsentinel.com/story/news/local/2022/04/20/whitmer-wants-save-palisades-nuclear-plant-lake-michigan-shore/7376628001/](https://www.hollandsentinel.com/story/news/local/2022/04/20/whitmer-wants-save-palisades-nuclear-plant-lake-michigan-shore/7376628001/)\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-04-29/california-promised-to-close-its-last-nuclear-plant-now-newsom-is-reconsidering](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-04-29/california-promised-to-close-its-last-nuclear-plant-now-newsom-is-reconsidering)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/newsom-offers-hope-for-californias-last-nuclear-plant-diablo-canyon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/newsom-offers-hope-for-californias-last-nuclear-plant-diablo-canyon.html)\n\n1. **Restarts** \\- The two biggest countries with restarts on the tablet right now are Germany and Japan. I will begin with Germany.\n\nAs eluded to above, the electrification of the world is not going to happen with wind, solar, hydro, etc. alone. Nuclear is going to play a massive role in it. A fact, that I do not believe escaped Elon Musk, as he recently tweeted out - See below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4pzu1dl1rgx81.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74ac346465811b66797fb73748d06e4dd15d9312\n\nIt is incredibly obvious that 24/7 power generation to supply the grid and all these new electric vehicles are going to be needed as part of the power mix. He understands this quite well and is advocating for Germany to restart their last nuclear reactors\u2026and in essence, call for an extension of another few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe given the state of the energy crisis Germany and the rest of the EU are experiencing, as well as the war (Ukraine/Russia), this is not going to ease up anytime soon.  Recent headlines have started surfacing of Germany extending the life of these three reactors, as well as restarts. While I think this is the absolutely correct move, I am not going to hold my breath here. Yes, this is rather bearish but needs to be mentioned. I do also believe that if push comes to shove, they will look at extensions.\n\nJapan - I am MUCH more confident in Japanese restarting as many of the other 23 reactors that are currently offline as possible. For starters, they restarted one in 2021. The option is clearly on the table. Furthermore, all of the news that has come out of Japan in the past month or two has been non-stop PRO-NUCLEAR. The new Prime Minister is for it, the citizens/popular sentiment is trending that way, and the recent blackout in Tokyo has clearly shifted the thought process to reexamining how to fast-track this process.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/japan-restarts-first-nuclear-reactor-since-2018-amid-hurdles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/japan-restarts-first-nuclear-reactor-since-2018-amid-hurdles)\n\n[https://www.cnet.com/science/japans-new-pm-wants-to-restart-nuclear-power-in-the-country/](https://www.cnet.com/science/japans-new-pm-wants-to-restart-nuclear-power-in-the-country/)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/most-japanese-back-nuclear-power-for-first-time-since-fukushima](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/most-japanese-back-nuclear-power-for-first-time-since-fukushima)\n\n[https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODK282XU0Y2A420C2000000/](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODK282XU0Y2A420C2000000/)\n\nAt the risk of losing your attention span, even more, I will wrap it up here. If there is an appetite for more information in this space, I will provide it.  Following the art of the DD, which frankly every post here should strive to do, I believe I have touched on climate, and story, and will now speak (briefly) on technicals, as they are not my strong suit.\n\n\u200b\u200b[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6j6gri/the\\_art\\_of\\_the\\_dd\\_for\\_beginners/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6j6gri/the_art_of_the_dd_for_beginners/)\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nNot by any means my strong suit. I tend to follow 50-200 DMA golden/death crosses as well as hammer patterns. I am a simple bloke when it comes to this space. If you enjoy this type of thing and are interested in a more in-depth look, here are some folks that tend to do a pretty decent job in the space.\n\nJohn - Twitter handle is u/Jhinster1\n\nScott - Twitter handle is u/U_Ag_\n\nAndy - Finding Value Finance (Youtube channel as well) - Twitter handle is u/finding_finance\n\nEast West - Twitter Handle is u/EastWest_advice\n\nIn lieu of technical analysis, here is a list of folks that have come out with comments ranging from anywhere between pro-nuclear to extremely bullish - in no particular order\u2026there\u2019s certainly more, and I am sure you have no heard of half of these names, but I respect them, so I will mention them.\n\nLarry McDonald - Kuppy - ChiGirl - Joshy Young - Happy Hawaiin - Lobo T - Elon Musk - Burry - LeadLag (twittername) - Jeff Clark - Bill Gates - Gwen Preston - Stansberry Research - Doomsberg - Patrick Ceresna - Robert Kietz - Lyn Alden - Trader Ferg - Trader Stewie - Lookingforhiddenvalue - Yellowbull - Antonio Atanasv -\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThis should be an entirely separate DD for each individual company, as well as proof of positions. I am open to doing that but it is beyond the scope of this particular post. I will note that the whole space lit up during the last CCJ earnings call. Their bullishness (or bearishness) speaks for all in this space, as there are so few active producers. I am also open to diving deeper into this section as well.\n\nI think given the recent pullback, this is an excellent time to look for an entry into this space. I\u2019m not advocating to go portfolio deep (translation - don\u2019t YOLO everything like some other morons have been doing recently\u2026WOW the posts and loss porn these past few days). I do think if some of you moved to put 10-20% of your portfolio outside of what you normally are trading (read: GME, AMC, TESLA\u2026and if you have not been margin called yet, WISH, CLOV, UWMC, SNDL, etc. etc.) into various commodities (Read: uranium, oil, wheat, corn, and others of the like), we might not be seeing as much insane loss porn here.\n\nPlease note, I rarely, if ever, buy FDs or options expiring in 60 days or less. I tend to be a net seller of those. In an extremely volatile space like this one, you do NOT need to be extremely aggressive to find leverage. LEAPS work just well for me.\n\nIf there is a dip on Wednesday (FED can really blow up or rocket anything at this point), I will look at adding some shorter CCJs\u2026as well as some other companies in the space. Since it is so small, I cannot actually post anything on them here without it getting removed. \n\nThis DD has \\~15 pages worth of content\u2026well over 100 if you actually look at the links, and more than 10 hours of audio/visual content as well.\n\nLastly, none of this should be construed as financial advice. This is the best current trade on my screen (oil is a second). Worthy of note, I have been wrong before. I will be wrong again. There are many Jim Henson worthy ass muppets out there that claim to have a flawless track record in the Uranium space. They are TRUE assholes. Watch out for those clowns...they are fairly easy to spot, as some do not wear shirts, some are allergic to sunlight and may or may not live in Castlevania, and some just have the absolutely biggest egos on the planet.\n\nCheers and best of luck with whatever you do",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nBelow is additional information on BBBY that, I believe, reinforces my assumptions on BBBY's and BABY's value. You can find my original post here (obligatory this is not financial advice):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/FWFBThinkTank/comments/udfr1z/bbby\\_baby\\_spinoff/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FWFBThinkTank/comments/udfr1z/bbby_baby_spinoff/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nLike GameStop, RC was actually late to the BBBY party **TOO**. Burry, DFV, Hestia Capital all came before RC in GameStop. Macellum, Legion Partners, and Ancora were all involved with BBBY before RC and actually made significant progress in turning around the business.\n\nFor as much as we believe RC is a great investor, he has now come in second place, twice. He didn't identify these investment before others. This isn't a knock on him. He is smart and made some great investments. Also, his vision for GME is by far more grandiose than others.\n\nSince we blindly follow him into any investment, its important to conduct our own DD and estimate returns/values with our own assumptions.\n\n[Also, it took decades for Buffet and Icahn to gain their fame. They also both had some pretty big misses. I think RC needs to understand it takes decades to be a great activist investor. ](https://preview.redd.it/6rc348d9oiy81.jpg?width=781&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e8d129f106325bcb732dadc58ff57db7838059)\n\nMacellum, Legion Partners, and Ancora, were all involved in BBBY back in 2019. This investor group successfully revamped the board, replacing 9 of 12 members, installed a completely new mgmt. team, CEO, and divested several non-core assets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whbkrddeoiy81.jpg?width=875&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f394ee09720795b9def9bd243df4da63c9dace80\n\n[ Some pretty significant diligence went into underwriting BBBY. Store visits, former employee interviews, their own survey conducted, BoD interviews, etc. ](https://preview.redd.it/vvfwl8teoiy81.jpg?width=978&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c84e031f695198a0c3c5a14335af32dfd0af321c)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3o47yjfoiy81.jpg?width=994&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44603b03234f099076b3f42f24787a58c315c954\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkmavl6goiy81.jpg?width=963&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4257de567f8c1409bfb7f4caee7474d691f8b5c2\n\n**Mgmt. Compensation**\n\nThis is crazy! Two Chairmen and the CEO received $313m in total compensation while BBBY\u2019s market cap declined by $8bn.\n\nThe Chairman was compensated $63K dollars for personal tax preparation needs in 2017.\n\nThe previous CEO lost investor trust by missing guidance for 4yrs straight.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lc3u8hfioiy81.jpg?width=970&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2febcad699d14e27379015c50ea25a736d0ce1a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/to0f552joiy81.jpg?width=977&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97acb6235228789c2160305e3059fb4337816bf\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\nThe previous mgmt. and board acquired literally everything. Twice acquiring businesses owned by family of the chairmen of BBBY's board. Do I see nepotism? This nepotism could ironically save BBBY.\n\nBBBY spent over $1bn on 10 acquisitions over the past 20yrs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rinyfka1riy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ca082c6335e0b85a1c028e17d1ddcdc04228327\n\n[Interesting commentary around buybuby baby being a bailout for the BBBY Chairman\u2019s family. Buybuby baby could actually be the best asset BBBY acquired over the past decade. ](https://preview.redd.it/43yf8qjkoiy81.jpg?width=981&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=283283338475b04fb66bf9f65c5c1336fe189f64)\n\n**Turnaround Plan**\n\nBBBY\u2019s BoD\n\nThe board has undergone a massive shift in the past two years. From Macellum advocating for new directors to RC\u2019s 3 new directors, the board is currently 14 people. All three of RC\u2019s board members are up for vote at the annual meeting. After the annual meeting, the board will decrease to 11 spots from 14.\n\n\u201cIn conjunction with the cooperation agreement, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond today announced that Ms. Bowen and Mr. Rosenzweig, will join a four-member Strategy Committee focused on exploring alternatives to unlock greater value from the Company's buybuy BABY banner.\u201d\n\nThe other two members are Sue Gove and Andrea Weiss.\n\nSue has significant experience as a board member for AutoZone, Conn\u2019s, and the Fresh Market.\n\nAndrea also has experience in spinoffs from being the Chief Store Officer at L\u2019Brands. She was also a board member at Pep Boys, Chico\u2019s, and O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts.\n\nUnder Sue\u2019s board service, Autozone divested and acquired multiple assets.\n\nUnder Andrea\u2019s board service O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts divested and acquired multiple assets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Macellum did a majority of the board and mgmt. revamp. RC only added 3 ppl and Macellum added 9.](https://preview.redd.it/fvrvja8xqiy81.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbb7d3130245c58ed50e17b9192cb81a09d90b40)\n\nSue Gove, John Fleming, Jeff Kirwan, and Josh Schechter were Macellum\u2019s nominees and remain on the board. These individuals were selected and have successfully executed Macellum\u2019s plan of divesting non-core assets. The addition of RC\u2019s three board members means even more pressure to divest BuyBuy Baby.\n\nMark Tritton was hired by members of this board to execute the turnaround plan and has successfully divested several assets.\n\nSo, the CEO and board were completely overhauled to turn BBBY around. They have executed successfully to a certain extent but are not finished.\n\nRC\u2019s board additions have put added pressured on Mark to finish executing the plan Macellum put in place.\n\n**After researching BBBY's board members and understanding the evolution of the board, my confidence in BBBY selling BABY has increased.**\n\n**Divestures**\n\n**Cost Plus World Market Analysis**\n\nBBBY acquired CPWM for $561m in Jan 2021 and sold it to Kingswood Capital for $110m in 2021.\n\n277 nationwide stores.\n\nMy research suggests CPWM\u2019s revenue reached between $950m - $1.1bn in 2021.\n\nThe P/S multiple was .11x based on sales of $1bn and the $110m EV Kingswood Capital paid to acquire the business.\n\nBelow is Macellum\u2019s estimated EV of each BBBY asset. Let\u2019s look at how accurate their estimates were.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxofdhmqoiy81.jpg?width=1014&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=846913677290e27f3cad4200fa31678bc2b43f4d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cn083govqiy81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ca3806437ccc00f4cd5e11f866a16f66ced095c\n\nMacellum estimated BBBY could generate $1.364bn in proceeds from the sale of Cost Plus, Christmas Tree, buybuy baby, and Personalization Mall. If you remove buybuy baby, you get $661m in proceeds and BBBY generated close to $600m in proceeds from the sales (a little less because of some debt/obligations not acquired). So Macellum wasn\u2019t far off on the total. They overestimated Cost Plus World Market and under estimated the Christmas Tree Shop.\n\nWhat does this tell us? Even sophiscated investors can value assets completely different from one another. Macellum believes one value is accurate while Kingswood Capital believes another value is accurate.\n\nRC\u2019s P/S value of buybuy baby could be completely valid or invalid, it all depends on who you are selling the asset to.\n\nIf we used CPWM as a comp to buybuy baby, BABY\u2019s EV would be $165m. I personally think this is undervaluing BABY but other PE groups might think its accurate.\n\nAssuming a PE firm pays $1.44bn in cash (1x P/S - a fairly reasonable comp), BBBY could use this in a multitude of ways. BBBY currently has $1.1bn of long-term. BBBY has been actively engaged in a share repurchase program.\n\nI believe the sale of BABY would allow BBBY to focus on its core competencies, pay down all long-term debt, renovate stores, and continue their share repurchase program.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvjj9kgtoiy81.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eb478a5ddfd3a02ed33d61e7ce8728c97c86a82\n\nI believe BBBY\u2019s share price would re-rate to $45/share after BABY\u2019s sale. This is still far below their peer group based on a P/S multiple.\n\nAt $45/share this implies and upside of 300%+.\n\nI currently own shares and leaps in BBBY.",

You ask, why the fuck isn\u2019t this showing in any numbers or charting? Well my dipshit GME owner, it\u2019s because myself and everyone else has a severance agreement that lasts 3-6 months that essentially prevents me from claiming unemployment. I have friends who just can\u2019t find jobs in their fields at all right now. While these laid off folks slowly tick their time bomb away and they remain unemployed, they aren\u2019t being counted in the unemployment total because they are technically still employed through severance. \n\nTherefore, I expect that this is going to slowly start catching up to us till later this year.

    "title": "Did some digging. Did you know the theories GME investors have about naked shorting are the same, recycled conspiracies from over a decade ago?",
    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/qDdRfD1\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ffJNaC0\n\nTL;DR: investors have been blaming negative price action on illegal naked shorting for decades. Modern day apes are using the same, rehashed arguments as their predecessors who fell for similar pump and dumps.\n\nI recently went down a rabbit hole after reading the recent posts on SS about CMKM. Apes claim this case is evidence that trillions of \"fake shares\" are possible. I found the above article which perfectly describes the similar situation some CMKM investors found themselves in after the fraud committed by CMKM execs was exposed. Rather than accept their losses, they held onto the lie that it was all the fault of naked short sellers.\n\nTo be clear, I don't believe there has been any fraud at the GME exec level. The parallels I draw are between the investors that refuse to accept reality, and rather blame everything on naked short selling. In GME's case the fraudsters, in my opinion, are the DD writers. They recklessly mislead apes in fields they have no experience in. They misinterpret data and con the unknowing into believing a financial conspiracy. Not to mention the shameless self promotion of their paid services and fund raisers that we have seen from some mods.\n\nFurther parallels can be seen in the below article which states \"Some pranced around the offices of the villainous Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. in 2005 (I work there, according to these morons), made damned fools of themselves and diverted scarce police resources.\"\n\nhttp://garyweiss.blogspot.com/2009/09/indictments-in-cmkm-diamonds-naked.html?m=1\n\nThe article references another similar case, that of Universal Exchange. This is another example of a company exec using the excuse of naked short sellers to defraud investors.\n\nhttps://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/what-will-you-bid-for-a-lawsuit/\n\nI find it quite hilarious that in the comments of the above article there are people making the same arguments as modern day apes. There are references to rule changes, rigging allegations, references to FTDs and allegations of people working for naked shorters.\n\nThe former CEO of Universal Express was sentenced to prison for securities fraud in 2014, by the way.\n\nhttps://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2014/05/06/ex-universal-express-ceo-altomate-prison-sentence.html\n\nI also found the fantastic article below. I'm not sure when it was written (I think around 2010), but it details this sort of thing happening since the 1990s. I particularly like this quote: \"many fall prey to hysterical hoopla purporting to explain how naked shorting is responsible\u00a0for the untimely deaths of \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of worthy startup companies, and will even one day cause the collapse of the global economy.\"\n\nhttps://promotionstocksecrets.com/naked-shorting/",

    "selftext": "If it isn\u2019t obvious by now, market makers and their hedge fund buddies have unleashed what potentially seems like a coordinated attack via shorting of retail favorite stocks over the past few weeks. None of what has unfolded recently makes any sense - i.e., treasury yields have never went parabolic as they just have before the Fed barely even had a chance to hike fed fund rates (appears to me that algos were deployed to run yields up). Yields (as well as the USD) behaving this way seems unnatural and is unprecedented, yet that was then used to justify the massive sell off in stocks, which I believe occurred due to short sellers forcing widespread margin calls. It\u2019s been quite a wild set of events but the time is ticking for these actors to cover their short positions because many experienced investors know the market has most likely bottomed and we are potentially going to reach new highs. I think going into next week there will be many major short covering as these players rush to cover and switch their portfolio positions to net long. Don\u2019t let them off easy folks\u2026I\u2019m holding positions in Hycroft Mining, BE, MSTR, Bit Digital, Hut 8 Mining, Soluna Holdings, Bakkt Holdings but also like GME, AMC right now.",

    "title": "The Most Undervalued Stock In All The Market RN!",
    "selftext": "Edit: News just came out that Warren Buffet bought more than %10!!! I will do another write up later with an update. Valhalla, here we come!\n\nHello fellow autists. If you're tired of losing money on 0TDE options and starting to think about buying good companies, that make good products/ services, make a profit and you're thinking about leaving your money there for a couple of years playing the long game...say less.\n\n**The Markets**\n\nThe markets (including almost every stock within it) have bled since about Nov of last year. We are coming up on the 8th month and [according to Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=how+long+is+the+average+bear+market&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8), the average length of all bear markets has been 289 days, so 9 and a half months. You may want to start thinking about front running and nibbling on some of your favourites. Sure, we can go a bit lower...but good companies are on sale rn and markets have historically recovered %100 of the time! Plus, the fear in the markets is same or worse than March 2020, the valuations have shaved off more capital than all the other downturns combined, and everything is technically VERY oversold. Again, we can go lower...but the risk vs reward is heavily skewed to the upside now.\n\n**The Play**\n\nParamount Global (ticker: PARA) is ViacommCBS and I am going to show why I think they are one of the most undervalued, overlooked companies in the world, and therefore possibly one of the best investment opportunities in the markets rn.\n\n**The Who**\n\nParamount has some of the most iconic and [highest grossing media brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises) ever made thanks to Nickelodeon. Just between Dora The explorer ($15.8 billion), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ($15.4 billion) and SpongeBob Squarepants ($14.8 billion), they've made $46 billion dollars. They have many, many more big brands (think licensing for merchandise, etc) as they host one of the richest content libraries in all media (Star Trek, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Paw Patrol are just some of the other ones). Their broadcast channel CBS is no slouch either; 7 out of the top 10 Most Watched Broadcast Series in the 2021/2022 season belongs to CBS (this allows them to demand top advertising dollar).\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/2aie1bx2biz81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b49a630001eaf9e1e44a7bf629db5da1c662ee](https://preview.redd.it/2aie1bx2biz81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b49a630001eaf9e1e44a7bf629db5da1c662ee)\n\n**The Fundamentals**\n\nThey have about 608 million shares outstanding and made just above $6 per share profit last year. They pay a $0.96 annual dividend which amounts to about %3.4. They have about $10 per share in cash.  Here, we have a company trading at a PE ratio of under 5 that is trading well below it's book value. Book Value is around $35. That means, if it went BK over night and they stripped it and sold off it's assets, you would get $35 a share...yet, the commons are trading at just above $28 today! Now, some people will say \"ya but that book value includes goodwill and intangibles\"...but the intangibles are those same brands I mentioned earlier. For example, Disney bought Star Wars for $4 billion, and they also bought Marvel for $4 billion. How much would selling each of the brands I mentioned fetch? Probably a lot more than the $18 billion market cap that the company stock is worth today! If they have $10 in cash per share...then ALL those other brands are worth $8 billion dollars? Not a chance.\n\nNow, Paramount is also turning to growth as it transitions from making money off licensing it's products to other networks and streamers, to going DTC through it's own streaming service, Paramount Plus. P+ is only a year old, but was CBS All Access before. They are growing at an enormous clip. Where did all the Netflix subscribers go? I think a lot are moving over to Paramount, who is growing so fast, management revised it's projections from 60 million subs next year to 100 million subs. Currently, between P+ and their other paying subscription services (Showtime, OTT), they have 60 million paying subscribers! By comparison, #1 Netflix has about 220 million and Disney has 205 million paying subs. Paramount is not likely to take over the #1 or #2 spot, but 3rd or 4th is a lock. Third place would be Warner Bros Discovery with about 100 million. Currently PARA is in 4th with 60 mil but I believe they can over take WBD in the next few years as they bring more of their licensed shows back in house - as is their game plan (%25 of whats on Netflix belongs to Paramount, which is all coming back in house). This shows they are very undervalued pegged up against it's industry peers and the industry averages. They will get to 200 million subscribers in the next 3-5 years, unless they get bought out before then. So there is tremendous growth ahead, yet it's not getting the same \"growth\" type valuations. It's being valued as solely a legacy cable business that has shrinking profits. Not true. While the year over year revenue declined in the most recent financial filings, this was due to the fact they had the Super Bowl last year and not this past January. Without the \"Super Bowl\" effect, revenue is actually up. They are a Free Cash Flow machine. While they themselves are projecting their earnings to go down in the next 1-2 years, this is bc they are spending more on content and investing back into their streaming business...by 2024, they are going to be doing 9 billion in revenue from the streaming DTC side alone. This is getting 0 love. I believe it will all change and the stock will double, if not triple from these levels. Even at double the current price, at around $56 per share, I'd say it's undervalued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Industry Peers](https://preview.redd.it/ioo5wdoxaiz81.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2523b7abe405a659deb7f77804c4e84e1c310b)\n\n**The Technicals**\n\nThe stock has bounced off the low 27s twice now since the new year and bounced up to the 37 resistance zone. It's dropped now once again due to shitty market conditions, but I believe it is now setting up the rare triple bottom. I'm aware it dropped a bit lower than the previous $27.25 low, but I don't believe double/ triple top or bottoms need to be to the exact cent, I think %1-2 is within range. There is a juicy open gap around $35 that I believe will get closed sooner rather than later, and then there's the open gap way up top around $85 which I also believe will close -albeit that one may take some time. Maybe not though. There is also evidence of some bullish divergence on numerous time frames as is also evident in a ton of other names, and even the indexes. I believe they've got everyone on the short side, buying puts...and the markets are about to melt up fuelled by short covering, and people jumping back in with FOMO as they realize they missed the bottom.\n\n**The Bonus**\n\nShari Redstone is the controlling shareholder of the Board. She put down almost $3 million of her own money and bought the commons in Feb between $28 and $29, so basically where we are now. She also bought back in November 2021 at around $36 but that was a much smaller buy. They say do as insiders do and Shari has loaded up over $3 mil of her money as she feels like me, this is very undervalued and we should be able to make some money buying shares down at these levels. On top of this organic growth, there has been much speculation that Shari wants to sell the company. Since there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry (Amazon buying MGM, Warner Bros buying Discovery, etc)...people feel Paramount is next to be swallowed up. At just $18 billion market cap, someone could want the content library and fairly low valuations even if you bought it at $60 a share, that would still be under $40 billion dollars. There are only a few people that could do that, in my opinion it would be between Amazon, or Apple. I'd say Disney and Comcast in there as well, but those deals might involve separating CBS out of the deal and just buying Viacomm, as there might be some anti-trust issues if they took in CBS as well. Earlier this year, when the [CEO Bob Bakish got asked a question](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/paramount-sale-viacomcbs-bob-bakish-1234705887/) about his company, he gave a really odd response starting with \"When I look at buying a company\"....why even mention that IF it isn't the game plan? He's hinted the company is up for sale and why not, PARA is a prime acquisition target and while that may not be a reason to buy into a company on it's self, it's just one more reason I sleep easy at nights.\n\nAnother short term bonus is that Top Gun 2 is coming out in a couple weeks and it's looking like it's going to be one of the biggest blockbuster in recent times! [Early reviews are crazy good](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/top-gun-maverick-first-reviews-the-most-thrilling-blockbuster-weve-gotten-in-years/)! They are going to blow the box offices out of the water, make an absolute killing and I'm looking forward to the buzz :)\n\n**Positions**\n\n15k shares at $28.50. Target is $65 within a year when the market wakes up and realizes how incorrectly they've been pricing PARA. Stop loss: What's a stop loss? I'm not selling if it dips to $25, I won't sell if it dips to $15...I won't even sell if we get a black swan event and it dips to $5. I will buy more. I will buy 5k shares every $5 drop. This entire write up has felt very DFV'ish (minus the short squeeze aspect) as I sit here and back a company I believe is being mispriced in a big way for whatever reason and am playing the long game believing the reversion back to the mean will happen. DFV was banging on the table about GME for about a year and a half before the actual squeeze happened. He spent a lot of time getting shit on by you degenerates, so please, go easy on me. lol\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nPARA is undervalued amongst it's peers and is growing in streaming like crazy rn and in the next few years. I believe they are getting valued incorrectly solely on their legacy cable side and getting nothing for all their intangibles which they could sell for multi-billions if they wanted to and their streaming side of the business (which is where all the growth is). All that content is coming in house, plus big blockbuster films are coming out - and it's a potential buy out target. Sitting on the low lows. Big upside potential.\n\n\\*Disclosure: Purple crayons taste best. Not financial advice.\n\nProof of Position: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgqu0l5uoxz81.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50b06db13f915237e1f15ebd7063777b65c4f1e",

    "title": "Owners\u2019 Equivalent Rent of Residence (OER), the CPI, and why 2022 is going to continue to be a crappy year for risk assets.",
    "selftext": "I don't mean to add to the chorus of doomsayers but do believe I came across an analysis not mentioned on the financial porn channels (ie CNBC) who are quick to speak of \"peak inflation\" having already passed. I'm also not aware of any real substantive analysis of the inputs into inflation (one in particular I will return to) among the real \"pros\" but I'm not plugged into those circles so who knows... maybe they're keeping it a secret.\n\nI'm just some dude who basically won the lottery and made life changing bank on TSLA calls a few years ago and moved to Puerto Rico.... I'm actally a physician by training, not an economist, so obviously due your own research. But all the talk of inflation seems to be missing something very obvious and I'm hoping to share.\n\nI want to start by saying that inflation in my view isn't as new or scary as some will make it seem. It's simply more demand than supply which causes prices to go up. We've all seen this play out countless times--not enough PS5s or or Yeezys or concert tickets or raw materials as people want and the prices start skyrocketing. The difference between the inflation Jerome Powell (JPOW) talks about and some dude hawking Yeezys at a 500% premium to sticker price is really just how pervasive it's become in so many parts of our lives--food, energy, shelter, ie the basics.\n\nJPOW got a lot of flak for repeatedly insisting last year that inflation was \"transitory.\" **In a philosophical sense maybe he was correct--everything in life is transient said the Buddha. And everything will eventually get sorted out--but it took years to get here. It could take years to get back.**\n\n*In a more immediate sense he was speaking of supply-demand mismatches that are partly a result of \"supply chain bottlenecks\" like chip shortages that cause shortages of new cars that had spill over effect into used cars. This is definitely part of the story. But so too is the confluence of pandemic-era accommodative fiscal (stimulus) and monetary (QE, negative real rates) policies by Congress and the Fed, respectively.* Just as one example, if a family was receiving thousands in stimulus payments and child tax credits (expiring) and also saw the value of their home and retirement accounts double because the Fed kept real rates near zero while buying trillions in bonds to essentially create money then they might have been quick to go out and buy an even bigger home or take a really nice vacation--but because millions of other families were in the same boat lumber prices and airfares started to soar. And in a sense this effect really is \"transitory\" although it will likely take years to mean revert.\n\n**By the end of 2019, the S&amp;P 500 had (already buoyed by 4 previous rounds of QE since 2008) trended up to 3000 and the Nasdaq to 9000. Markets tend to overshoot and overcorrect** so short or medium term it's really anyones guess where things will bottom out but in the absence of QE and the return of higher interest rates I think we are likely to revert back to the pre-pandemic trajectory at some point. **And there's another 20-25% of correction left before we get there.**\n\nFutures are positive this morning and it will probably be a choppy road but the reason in my view markets haven't corrected harder is the hope that the Fed can somehow engineer a \"soft landing,\" or in other words avoid having to engineer a recession to get asset prices back in line. This will be difficult for a number of reasons that are not a secret: The conflict in Ukraine has further accelerated the multiyear supercycle in commodity prices (if you look back in history, commodities invariably go through multiyear periods of extended boom followed by cyclical bust) **that was already underway. Furthermore, extended Covid-related lockdowns in China will cause further supply disruptions and costs increases.**\n\n**And now with all this in context I finally get to the crux of my post:** While the markets are probably pricing in Ukraine and the China-lockdowns and the probably of two 50 basis point increase in interest rates, **the Fed will likely be under even greater pressure to raise interest rates more and possibly faster than markets are already expecting while also drawing down their massive balance sheet for one rarely discussed reason:**\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm)\n\nWe use the BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary gauge of inflation. **In the CPI, there are two components of housing costs: owners\u2019 equivalent rent of residence (OER) and rent of primary residence, which combined are 40 percent of core CPI**, which is the most widely watched because it excludes volatile energy and food prices.\n\nHowever, these are not real-time metrics. Unlike milk which people buy often, people enter into longterm leases and as such the BLS (the government agency that publishes the monthly CPI) divides into 6 cohorts. For the May measure, which will be released in the second week of June, the will ask 1/6th of respondents how much they pay in rent despite the fact that most of respondents entered leases during the pandemic when before wages and home prices started to skyrocket and the measure will be artificially lower.\n\nAn even larger component of the 40% than actual rent is owners\u2019 equivalent rent of residence (OER).\\*\\*The methodology is beyond the scope but basically because BLS considers homes investments rather than consumption so uses an indirect metric rather than asking about actual expenses like maintenance or **mortgage rates (which are rising and not captured)** or taxes. I'm going to defer to a group of economists much smarter than me to explain. One is Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary, Chief Economist for the World Bank, and President of Harvard. This research is supported by multiple others and I will post a longer lit review if enough interest but probably suffice to say this is solid research by world leading scholars with no obvious interest in manipulating markets or selling anything and much more helpful than whatever equity research department at Goldman says.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795)\n\n&gt;\"\\[Last year\\] home prices have jumped by 19.9 percent according to Zillow. The Zillow Observed Rent Index has increased 14.9 percent, and the CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index, likely to be a particularly good leading indicator for OER, had risen by 12 percent in December...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dolmas &amp; Zhou (2021) documents that historically the BLS measure of 12-month change in rental prices is more strongly correlated with the 12-month change in housing prices observed 16 months earlier than any more recent reading \\[see [https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824)\\]...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Using a variety of techniques and datasets, we estimate housing\u2019s contribution to 2022 inflation as almost incompatible with a swift return to trend inflation.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I don't think the 16 month delay is definitive but needless to say the CPI data we are looking at is VERY STALE and at least a year old. While we may say headlines about airplanes fares (only 0.5% of the CPI) we forget that 40% of core CPI measures direct and indirect rents over a year ago and won't capture any decreases until 2023 at the earliest. For this reason, it is my view that the Fed will be under pressure well into next year to continue to raise rates and push markets further down to eventually mean revert to pre-pandemic levels.**\n\nSo what to do?\n\n**C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me aka Delever)**. Even if the scenario of a Fed being more Hawkish than currently priced somehow doesn't pan out the risk-reward profile of markets at present is not favorable in my view. **Keep a lot of cash on hand**. Even if you're still convinced GME is the greatest thing since sliced bread, keep some cash. **Remember that high beta growth stocks are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates since their valuation depends in part on very far out csh flows that need to be discounted to present at a higher cost of capital.**\n\nAlso **consider hedging**. Put options might be an obvious play but also consider (and I usually hate ETFs)  like and ETF that is short ARKK or SOGU (which is short SPACS) or an ETF short emerging markets (which tend to get hit even worse than the US when rates rise quickly) or an ETF short the US housing market on a forward basis... not 16 months delayed like the CPI.\n\nAnd **diversify**. Sounds like boring boomer advice and the energy trade has become crowded but the energy sector and underlying commodities remain attractively priced in my view. Yes you would have ignored me 6 months ago and that \"would have been the time to buy\" but with PEs of 10s and low price to book and sky high dividends and buybacks this sector remains attractive in the face of rising inflation for the next few years until everything gets sorted out. Remember that commodities tend to rise in supercycles that last years and it's possible we're just getting started.",

And if you're wondering, no it's not super easy to just convert that space to residential units - the reason is you need a whole lot more plumbing and HVAC and electrical boxes/meters for residential than you do for offices, and it's not super easy to add that stuff to existing buildings.  I mean, it's doable, but it isn't fast or cheap, and often involves upgrading the lines coming into and out of the building as well as just the internal work.\n\nNow, onto the macro picture:\n\nFirst, the Fed has been lying its ass off for months now about cracking down on inflation.  They've been talking a big game since this winter about starting QT, or halting bond purchases, or any number of other things.  Look at what they're actually doing in the bond market - they're still buying billions of dollars of MBS and other bonds every day.  I believe that \"they're for sure going to actually start QT in June or July\" or whatever the next made up date is as much as I believe Biden is really going to turn student loan payments back on in August.\n\nNow, as far as the \"rate hikes\" they've been issuing?  The way the Fed raises interest rates is they increase the amount they charge banks for overnight loans.  It's gone from 0.0-0.25 to 0.75-1.0, which is a .75 basis point hike, right?  Not so fast.  Because if you'll notice, both times JPOW increased the Fed Funds Rate, he ALSO increased the ONRRP rate by the same amount.  The ONRRP is basically the banks lending the Fed money overnight and getting paid interest on it.  The current ONRRP rate is 0.8.  It went from 0.05 to 0.3 at the same time the Fed rate went from 0 to 0.25, and it went from 0.3 to 0.8 at the same time the Fed rate went from .25 to .75.  About $1.8-$1.9 trillion is going through the ONRRP every day.\n\nBasically the fed \"loans\" money to the banks at .75, then \"borrows\" it back at .8 every night.  Now it's not a 1:1 ratio, but it means that some banks are actually at negative rates right now (because they're lending money like they're paying .75 for it when they're actually paying -.05, which is a big increase in profits), while others are not.  Weirdly, it's mostly the big megabanks and wall street that are getting the extra cash out of this deal.  So strange that the guy who bought bonds himself then had the Fed buy the same bonds to drive the value of his up is also corrupt in other ways.  Total shocker.\n\n**Too complex didn't understand: the money printer never stopped going BBRRRR!! and in some ways has increased it's print run to the big boys.**\n\nFinally, the recent earnings reports are flashing giant red lights about the economy.  Home Depot and Apple had big hits, Target, Wal-Mart, and Amazon had big misses.  IE: construction, home improvement and luxury goods are doing well, but basic cheap stuff isn't.  This basically translates to the upper class and prime workforce groups are doing great, but the majority of the country who are in the lower classes are getting their asses handed to them by ever increasing food, housing, gas, and energy costs.  That's going to travel up the chain, and you'll start seeing people who upgraded to Whole Foods and iPhones over the last few years all of a sudden deciding a cheap android and wal-mart are actually perfectly fine replacements.\n\nSome positions and tickers I'm running, but if you follow you'll have a higher cost basis than I do, be aware of that.\n\n12/16 SPY 200p\n\n9/16 SPY 245p\n\n8/19 SPY 295p\n\nAs always, 90%+ of my portfolio is GME shares and leaps.\n\nI've got fair value on AMZN at around $500, and AAPL around $40, but I have no idea if they'll get that low, and if AAPL gets anywhere near that price, I have to imagine that between Buffet and their dragon's hoard of cash it would just be taken private.  They're both boomer P/E and dividend stocks that for some reason are still valued as growth tech plays.  Won't last forever, but this is a case of market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, so take care with those two in particular.\n\nGlobal food shortage this fall is shaping up to be really bad - but it's not completely locked in yet, weather pattern reversals and various other miracles could still happen - just something to keep in the back of your head when making plays.",

In this high inflation, low supply environment I propose buying and stockpiling a new investment vehicle: electric cars. \n\nGone are the days when new cars lose 50% the moment you drive them off the lot. There's a high demand and everyone is flush with cash from panic selling. Supply chains are stressed causing the inventories of new cars on lots to dwindle. Everyone wants that hot new EV as they see gas prices rise every week.\n\nWhen a new gaming console is released people will scoop up all they can to resell on eBay. Why not do the same with cars? Because the shitbags that do this are too poor, that's why. This is an opportunity for degenerates like us to step in.\n\nThere is no way this could go tits up. Dealerships are notoriously a pain in the ass to deal with. People will welcome the opportunity to buy from a private seller at a markup just to avoid paying dealer markups. If this entire sub gets on board with the plan we could buy every EV in America and then they'd have to deal with us. It would be exactly like the GME short squeeze. Exactly.\n\nEven if it doesn't work out exactly right, EVs are also chock full of precious metals. In a few years if the cars don't sell you could just bring them to a scrap yard and easily make a profit on that alone. If that doesn't work you'll have your pick of your vehicles to live in.

    "title": "Volatility and You: How Underhedging Creates Crashes",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR**: The market is, in general, underhedged. Lack of hedging with put options is creating a scenario that makes our ability to rally upward much harder and increases crash risk. Buy short-dated ATM straddles (more risky), buy puts, directly short the S&amp;P 500 (less risky), or stay in cash (not really risky at all) (see \"How to position yourself\").\n\n---\n\n&gt; *SINK RATE! SINK RATE!*\n\n\\- Boeing 787 MAX TAWS, being piloted by Captain Powell\n\n---\n\nLet's talk about options! The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) has the most liquid options market in probably the world. Now sometimes people, instead of using these derivatives for gambling based on what side of a yard a dog poops on, use them to hedge their exposures to stocks and the market. \n\nThey are bought and sold by market makers (Citadel's the king, obviously, but there are others). People (in general) buy put options and sell call options. Sometimes though, there are speculators who would buy call options and sell put options (think WSB, thetagang, your grandfather's pension, etc).\n\nMarket makers want to do one thing: capture the spread between the bid and the ask price. They don't care about short ladders or whatever. They'll happily be long or short SPX, GME^[1], TSLA, whatever if it makes them more money.\n\nIn order to hedge their exposure to the movement of stock price action (gamma), volatility (vanna), and time (charm), they buy and sell /ES (S&amp;P futures) to hedge to their delta^[2].\n\nIf dealers are negatively exposed to *gamma*, things get a bit volatile but if dealers get negatively exposed to *vanna*, things get real volatile real fast because they are selling into selling (which increases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) and buying into buying (which decreases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) in order to hedge.\n\nTo explain with a simple analogy: that crazy ex, she's vanna. Vanna will take you to your highest highs but will also take you to your lowest lows. And... yeah those lows will be low. And no, I'm not going to help you \"get over\" her. And by the way, my bf is coming over for the week so we'll need the house.\n\nBack to options.\n\nIt's worth noting that dealers quote their options in *volatility* terms, not dollars and cents^[3]. But implied volatility is relatively low for a 1000 point drop right now and [*isn't increasing as we drop*](https://i.imgur.com/ct8TGaJ.png).\n\nThis is because there are a lot of people systematically selling puts, driving down IV. And because IV is being driven down by the put sellers, bulls can't get a sustained bear market rally (since these rallies are often fueled by rehedging)\n\nBut it's pretty obvious to anyone who's traded that realized volatility has far outstripped implied volatility (especially on the \"FDs\") and that FDs are relatively cheap. VIX is 29 right now, which implies about a 2%ish (off the top of my head) move each day. We're getting multi percent intraday moves, even if close-to-close we're going relatively slow. *This is absurd.*\n\nI could go on but you get the point already so let's move on.\n\n# How to position yourself\n\nSo... there are a couple ways you can play this relatively historic event depending on your risk tolerance (from most risky to least risky)\n\n1. **Buy straddles extremely close to expiration, especially on days with large intraday moves.** Because IV is chronically underpriced here, you should be able to make money buying 0 DTE straddles. Don't use Robinhood or anything like that, they'll screw you over by market selling your position early. Also don't do it systematically, because you will lose out when you don't get the move you want.\n2. **Buy somewhat longer term put options.** SPX 6/21 3800p (SPY 6/21 380p) is probably a decent option and has a decent chance of going ITM. You can sell on a volatility spike or keep them going into expiration.\n3. **Keep hitting those tails.** 3\u03c3 30 DTE SPY put options (it's currently SPY 6/21 305p) are only 13bps ($0.50). On a massive move, those tails will explode in value. You're not going for them going ITM, you're going for P/L so you can unload your bags onto Citadel. Buy them when VIX is in the 20s.\n4. **Short E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures (/ES or /MES) or SPY or something.** This will be probably the least gut wrenching thing to do. You'll make a lot of money, but you probably won't get a heart attack in 20 years from the stress of watching options change rapidly in value. So... it has its downsides. Wait for a large volatility blow up (look at VIX) or for Fed to reverse course to unload your position.\n5. **Go cashgang.** Sure you'll miss out on gains, but you'll only decay at 8%/year vs. the 30%+ drop (+ decaying at 8%/year). You can [place $10k into I-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) if you're worried about inflation at an interest rate of 9.62% *risk-free*.\n\n(My positions are #4 and a bit of #3 opportunistically.)\n\nGood luck WSB, you're gonna need it.\n\n# Some anticipated criticism\n**But volatility is heteroskedastic!**\n\nYour criticism here is basically that IV doesn't move 1-to-1 with SPX and while that's true, realized volatility is still above implied volatility (VIX should be like in the 40s). But implied volatility is still implying that there isn't hedging and a deeper analysis reveals that in general, there are a lot of put sellers.\n\nThere's also a pretty well established inverse correlation in SPX with IV in general (although don't naively apply this to single stocks, especially ones like GME). \n\n**But volatility should be low for a sustained drop!**\n\nSure but volatility isn't constant and is based on a few things including how \"\"\"fearful\"\"\" the market is. And even so, even if we sustained a constant move down every single day (which we don't) you'd still have gamma P/L to contend with. This alone makes it so that volatility is 0 or whatever but it's also dependent on other factors here. What I'm contending here is that these factors are such that volatility is massive underpriced, especially with the massive intraday moves that we are seeing.\n\n**VIX is a bad volatility index!**\n\nYeah I know but I used it for simplicity. Anyone in the vol space knows that SPX vol and skew (not the SKEW index!) isn't being bid up all that much relatively so... yeah.\n\n# Footnotes\n1. Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options. MMs got caught offsides a bit by the January 2021 event (basically the options chain acted as if every option was 50\u0394) and the gamma profile was very negative then, as anyone who works on a desk will tell you (this is what the SEC got wrong in their report). It's an interesting happening, but it's a story for another time.\n\n2. Plus some to account for skew. Also, it's worth noting that delta-hedging exists independent of BSM. You still have to hedge for price movements, volatility, and time even if you aren't pricing your options using BSM, which practitioners don't.\n\n3. Remember that everything except for volatility and rates are known observables so these are the only two things that can really be \"priced\" per se. Something like BSM can be used to map IVs to dollars and cents.\n\n[1]: #footnotes \"Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options.

    "selftext": "Obviously his notoriety came from his massive GameStop gains but, even without GameStop, his spreadsheet portfolio has returned over 300% since April 2021, and over 1500% since March 2020.    Im assuming his current holdings are much different, but we work with what we got.\n\nThese are just incomplete notes on his process, not an endorsement.  Gathered from rewatching all of his livestreams.\n\nFirst and foremost, his process is incredibly simple, despite his knowledge and acumen being pretty damned advanced. \n\nHis method:\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have an exact routine he follows 100% every stream, but there are certain things he tends to do almost religiously when dumpster diving.  \n\n\nPlaces he starts?  \n\nHe often checks the holdings on Whale Wisdom for:\n\n- Greenlight Capital\n- Towle Deep Value Fund\n- Scion Asset Management\n- Abrams Capital Management \n- Baupost\n- Contrarius Investment Management \n- Carl Icahn\n\nHe seems to have the most overlap with the smaller market cap holdings of Greenlight and Scion.\n\nId expect an investor like Einhorn to perform incredibly well during times like these.\n\nHow does he weigh their holdings and decide which ones deserve his time?\n\n - % owned &gt;5% is a big factor as it can often mean the investor has deeper involvement beyond just the purchase of the shares.\n\n- Marketcap below $5bn.\n\n- Cross reference all holdings on Openinsider.com.  Looking for clusters of recent insider purchases (within the last 6 months). More recent= better obviously.\n\nThese criteria alone often result in a stock being added to his watch list.\n\nSimple.\n\nWhat types of companies does he like?\nCompanies with overblown bankruptcy risk.\n\n\u201cIf none of the companies you invest in go bankrupt, you aren\u2019t taking enough risk.\u201d \n- DFV \n\nLmao what a quote.  He\u2019s bought stock, had the company go bankrupt, but it was still a 2-3 bagger because of liquidation value compared to what he paid.\n\nSome people like to cross all their Ts and dot all their i\u2019s for every single stock they research.  Not DFV.  He views being able to quickly go through surface level analysis of 500 stocks to be far more valuable than deep analysis of only 30.  \n\nHe always maintained a cash position.  It fluctuated, and the lowest I noticed it go was 5%.  Not sure I ever saw it above 10%, can\u2019t recall.  \n\nBuy criteria and important metrics. \n\n1) SIGNIFICANT discount via the following multiples:\n - Price to book (anything where P/B &lt; 0.7 seems to pique his interest)\n- Price to tangible book\n- EV to EBITDA\n- Price to sales(YES, price to sales is not useless)  He seems to get excited when this number is below 0.1.  Often digs deeper when companies have &gt;$2bn revenue and &lt;$400m mkt cap.\n\n2) Insider Buying.  He checks openinsider.com every single day.\nHe admits that this may carry more weight than all other factors.\n\n3) Overlap with renowned investors (mentioned above)\n\n4) Positive Free Cash Flow.  Massively important.   Most of the trash he sifts through doesn\u2019t have it, but when he comes across a company at a high discount with positive FCF he gives it a deep dive.  GME was a prime example.\n\n5) Market cap size:  His sweet spot is between $200m-$5bn but He will buy any size though, this is just his preferred range.  Reason:  Companies in this range are sized so that max 1-2 large firms can take a significant stake but if price begins to move, more firms can pile in.  This range is also where the most mis-pricings occur. \n\n6) Balance sheet, bond prices, and credit risk.   Many of the companies he buys have declining earnings, so credit analysis is crucial.\n\n7) Seeing a path to positive investor sentiment.  Value alone isn\u2019t enough.  So you found a stock that is undervalued by a factor of 10.  Who cares? It\u2019s undervalued today, who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t remain undervalued for another 10 years.  There needs to be something in the road ahead that will cause people to buy it.  Sometimes it\u2019s simply a stabilizing of cash flows and revenues.  often it is a turnaround play, activist investors, macro tailwinds, etc\u2026 \n\n8) Stable gross margins. He consistently checks for this.  He still dabbles in stocks with bad/declining gross margins, but his conviction level is heavily influenced by this metric.  Another reason he was bullish on GME.\n\n9) Technical analysis.  He uses this just for timing. Not a pro at TA.\n\n10) He reads stock analysis articles, but Jeremy Blum from SA was the only writer I Ever saw him take seriously.\n\nGoal:  Find a company that investors seem to think will be bankrupt in a couple years, but will actually survive +5 years or even potentially thrive.  He is almost exclusively looking at trash companies.   It looked like 80% of his plays were either turnarounds or cyclicals.  \n\nExpectations:  50-100% yoy returns.  He\u2019s said that his style has crushed the market over the past decade.  Who knows if that\u2019s true, but a quick look at his spreadsheets revealed that even without GME, 2020 and 2021 would have returned him insane numbers. Not bad. \n\n\u201cThe reason most fund managers can\u2019t beat the market isn\u2019t because they suck, it\u2019s because they have too much capital.  That\u2019s our edge.  There\u2019s room for us to invest a significant % of our capital side by side with Burry in GME, or with Carl Icahn in Sand Ridge.  Buffet can never allocate even 1% to a potential 50 bagger.\u201d   Their success is what\u2019s holding them back, not their incompetence.\n\n\nMetrics he doesn\u2019t really care about :\n\n- DCF Models and precise valuations\n \u201cNobody cares if you can value a company.  It\u2019s not even possible to do it accurately anyway.  Just come up with a quick range, and demand an undeniably massive discount.\u201d    He never spends time doing a dcf. \n\n- p/e .  \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at companies that have a lot of hair on them, p/e means almost nothing.  Revenues are often declining, bankruptcy is a real possibility, so who gives a shit about p/e.\u201d\n\n- short interest.  It is almost irrelevant and if it\u2019s high, it\u2019s usually a turn off.   GME was an exception because of his deep knowledge of the company.\n\n\nHow does he use openinsider.com?\n\nAfter cross referencing holdings from renowned investors, he will look on open insider for cluster buys.   If he finds something significant, like 5+ insiders buying stock, he will google those insiders to see if they have a track record in investing.   He will toss the company into whale wisdom and see if any funds have a stake &gt;5% in the company, then research those funds to look for performance history or activist investor history.  If everything looks good, he will add it to the watch list and dig deeper later.\n\nFurther to that, I found this post where his spreadsheets were recreated.    These sheets are absolute found money.  Cannot overstate how useful they are.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/roaringkitty/comments/ux6iae/dfvs_roaring_kitty_spreadsheets_v07_now_available/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nFinally, what might his portfolio look like now?\n\nHad to delete, automod said most of the tickers were banned. :)",

    "title": "INCREDIBLE GRAPHIC OF WEIGHT OF INTEREST RATES",
    "selftext": "Interest rates are going to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.  Historically, interest rates have had to rise above the rate of inflation to lower said inflation.  This would imply a Fed Funds Rate of about 10% today, not the 0.75% we have currently.  The Fed and others will insist that inflation is going to subside, just as they already have with their \"inflation is transitory\" argument.\n\nThe reason the market hit all time peak valuations is that money was cheaper than ever up until the last few months.  The cost to borrow with interest rates so low allowed investors, corporations, consumers, and governments to borrow an unfathomable amount of money, \"promoting\" economic growth.  The issue now is that with rates rising, expansion is over.  Businesses are already slashing forecasts and projecting slowdowns. \n\nBut what is the real weight of the interest rates increasing?  Let's take a look at what a house buyer would have paid 1.5 years ago, and what one would pay today.  \n\nA key issue here is that rates are much more elastic than housing prices.  Housing prices will only drop once there is mass foreclosure such as the Financial Crisis.  The issue today is that, with significant inflation pressures, the prices are unlikely to come down.\n\nSo if you are in the market for a new house, I suggest you get moving quickly.  It will only get worse.\n\nOh I forgot, you apes have all your money tied up in $GME and $AMC.  Get your Diamond Hands a Ferrari with a 5th wheel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo5gxid64u191.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9477f61a0680581c04c704bb92f7627d937262fa",

We have seen hedge funds topple, war against \u201cretail investors,\u201d and overall market chaos.  $GME is a classic example of trade the chart and trade momentum, don\u2019t get caught up in the fundamentals.  It is comical when the \u201canalysts\u201d of the world talk about how overvalued the meme stocks are.  It\u2019s a classic example of supply and demand, and the people are demanding another rally.\n\nHere, we look back at the last 5 earnings calls, how $GME performed the week before, the week after, and the two weeks totaled together.\n\nWhat is of significant interest is the runup to these earnings, with Gamestop stock sitting up over 30% since May 23.  Despite the incredible runs $GME has had over the past two years, the stock has not, in this time period anyway, ever had as much momentum before earnings.  It begs to ask the question: is the momentum out of steam, or are we going to see $GME back in the headlines? \n\nAnalyzing the technicals, 23% of the float short and an RSI only at 57.  Shorts should be deathly afraid to hold their positions going into next week with these statistics. \n\n**Looks like a whole bunch of you apes are going to be buying Teslas again.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7dzrkenf0291.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9a9d65d2bdbc3ca857358d9edd48662702ece7",

    "title": "Market/Meme summer insanity coming. UVXY explained",
    "selftext": "So for all you nose bleeding, fairy godmothers out there, I am here to put some pepto bismol up ur ass for the summer. I want to help you, even though I hate your guts. I am extremely good at timing major market moves- this last 2 months was a very brutal ass pounding, but pretty precise in its wave dynamic in setting up for one of the most bullish moves with the vix &lt;25 in my lifetime for the next \\~2.5 months. Last week was a very strong initial confirmation and this week will solidify it.\n\nDoes anyone know why the Vix was smashing 35, but unable to break and why UVXY did not move in a parabolic way on this \"correction\" or \"bear market\"? Because we're not in a fucking bear market you finger smelling substitute teachers. This was the most violent bear trap I've seen in my life.\n\nThere's so many answers to this question, but one parameter to have a VIOLENT correction, the market needs to stabilize up. Wave 5, or B wave if you will. It's a FUNCTION of the stock market. It HAS to, or it will never go back up ever again. We haven't had that- it's represented by the movement in UVXY and the overall day to day movement in the market- We STILL HAVENT HAD IT. The importance of UVXY movement can tell you the \"strength of spy\" on a minute to minute, hour/day/month to month etc. Anyone who talks about UVXY and tries to explain its movement with \"decay and contango and front month futures\" just go back in your cage, Harambe.\n\nThe easiest way to explain/show this is how UVXY peaked early May, but the market went lower the next 3 weeks. On May 5th the market went up 1% in 1 minute. ONE % IN ONE MINUTE!!!! This is a stabilizer of momentum. The BULL MARKET stabilizes up, to allow for a violent overextension downwards (aka bear trap) **WHILE MAINTAINING A BULLISH BIAS**. I thought this overextension would last \\~3 days. The drop(hedge funds blew up that day), the doji, then CPI reversal, as most simple vix events last 3 days with that pattern. Instead it took 3 weeks- but the same pattern held true. The purpose of this is to maintain bearish momentum in the market...either much further out-years, or EXTREMELY violent this year, we'll get to that. \"that means the market knows where it's going?\" Yes. It does. Crazy for a million reasons? Yes, but true.\n\nThe importance of Friday's move is this...Market up 2% Thurs, UVXY flat. Market up 2.2% Friday UVXY flat. Market up \\~.4% in the last 30 seconds of trade, UVXY CRUSHEDDDD. The last week of movement wasn't bullish- it was just NOT BEARISH. The \"bull market\" just activated the last 30 seconds of trade...so what do you think is coming, apes? The market wasn't even impulsing higher, it was a reactive move off of the blow off bottom the last 3 weeks...and you know this...because of HOW UVXY MOVED. I've watched UVXY/SPY movement every day for 10 years. This is the correlation. This is why so many people are confused when they are both up or down together. It has NOTHING to do with decay. ur mother's ass warts, or Trump.\n\nAnother way to see this is May 19th. The market was flat but UVXY got CRUSHEDDD. This represents the market \"catching the weight of the market and holding+accerlerating up\". I know this to be true because, again, I've watched the correlation for 10 years. It may take a day a week or 6 months to play out, but it always does and it's up to YOU to figure it out. **It is the larger wave dynamic in the market doing what it needs to do to prepare for future moves.** And in this case, it is confirming it already!\n\nThis is only 1 piece of many many things I see and, thus, I see an enormous wave higher coming into the summer. I have my targets and assumptions of what to see. Basic TA can NEVER see these waves, which is why so many people get fucked. A candle is not a candle is not a candle. The quality of the intraday movement actually matters.\n\n**Targets: SPY ATH or close to ATH by August- we are in buy the dip trend not sell the rip- everyone in the world is saying sell the rip :), The meme/arkk trade will explode in June/July. I expect GME to break at least 250 with a target of about 380 with possible ATH. All other meme targets will track GME target as they are all basket stocks and move together.**\n\nSorry to burst the bubble, though, after this rally there is a very high chance we'll have a flash crash in about August **if** things get triggered. We will flash crash in a way the market has never seen before as per the VIX wave dynamic. This down momentum NEVER DISAPPEARS. It is FOREVER in the market until it gets released. If not this year, it will eventually happen that I can time when ready. I've never seen something this scary before. Like actually I get scared thinking about it. My guess is \\~75 on the vix, but REALLY fast with a fast recovery. This isn't \"the big one\" for the memes or the market itself either. It'll be a great buying opportunity into 2023 for boomer stocks if it happens in Aug.\n\nTLDR: Hopefully I could have shed some light on UVXY, which blew up my account many years ago- if I can help a few degens not double down on bearish sentiment, why not? Buy and hold memes into July and if things get triggered, a flash crash of epic proportions in August. Also, recession 2023 not 2022 fucking nerds xD\n\nNot financial advice\n\nFor those crying about show something. Max bear copium. I have no problem taking ur money. P.S. dont do like me and buy SPY. Buy SPX for 60% LTG instead. Whoops\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1pd1hcft5p291.png?width=971&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae3ca49fb04c5f1dcec80a620d41a616483388ae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yry7zyn5p291.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d4cd572caa4b6ce3109c1c0a608b2487814ec11",

    "selftext": "I've seen a bunch of funny memes and posts the in past day about the SEC's decision to create a special meme category for certain stocks such as GME and AMC...for \"consumer protection\". I saw that Mr. Burns looking moron give an interview lying through his crooked, yellow, rotten teeth about how this is meant to protect the consumer against risky investments. \n\nSo if an investment is risky it constitutes it as a meme? If so, is 90% of tech a meme? Netflix is down from 700 to 200, is that a meme? How about Paypal being down from 300 to 80? Both a part of a long line of profitable and sustainable tech companies that have possibly cost some investors a much larger absolute amount/percentage than what the SEC calls a meme. \n\nMy idiot cousin, who \"works\" as a broker, said it's easy to know what a meme is...just look at WSB and whatever has a bunch of memes about it is a meme. So if we post memes about apple, microsoft, amazon, and other blue chips do they become memes? Will the SEC put them in that category too?\n\nThis isn't just idiotic, it's corrupt and very dangerous. The government body meant to ensure the legal trade of securities in this country is actively picking and choosing which stocks to put in a shitbasket called memes. This is literally a government agency telling people which stocks not to buy...based on zero rationale.\n\nThe only meme here is that these morons take home a nice salary, get health insurance, and a pension off of our tax dollars.",

    "selftext": "I wanted to buy $136 strikes on GME today anticipating a rebound to that line of resistance from a few days back. They were $0.25 - so I was going to buy 8 for $200. Fidelity denied me stating \"(100963) Fidelity restricts certain opening option transactions to prevent exercise and assignment risk. Opening orders for options that expire that day are not accepted. Options for this security that do not expire today are eligible to trade. Please note, I had messed up the math and said I lost $1200 profit, but lack of sleep - I only calculated for 4 options, not 8 that I was trying to buy.\n\nThere is not risk of early assignment for a bought call option. Only for the sold option. When I checked later, the bid/ask spread had these valued at easily $225 each, meaning missed out on $1600 simply because Fidelity would not let me risk $200 of my own money, even utilizing settled cash.\n\nChat with Fidelity (my responses bold):\n\n **I have a question about my account e.g., moving money, investments, etc.**  \n\n\n*Please share some details so a representative can best support you.*\n\n**I was denied the ability to buy call options expiring today.**\n\nPlease wait a minute while I connect you with a live chat representative. There may be a brief delay before the chat appears.\n\nSession has been authenticated\n\nNew party ('Hannah') has joined the session\"(100963) \n\n**Fidelity restricts certain opening option transactions to prevent exercise and assignment risk. Opening orders for options that expire that day are not accepted. Options for this security that do not expire today are eligible to trade.\" - there is not exercise assignment risk if I am the long holder of a call option. This is ridiculous and costed me $1200 of profit. I know how to manage option risk.**\n\nThank you for contacting Fidelity Investments. My name is Hannah. I understand you may have has issues placing a trade. One moment while I review your messages\n\n**Is there anyway to remove this restriction?**\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a restriction that can be removed. I do apologize for any inconvenience. I will, however, submit you message as feedback\n\n**Thank you. Anticipate many users leaving Fidelity for brokers that do not have this restriction.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nFidelity fucks. They restrict us from risking our own money where there is no risk - max loss of $200 which I have settled cash for in my account. They \"cannot remove this restriction.\" It would make sense on selling a last day call, but not buying one.\n\nEDIT: Potentially my Fidelity account setup through my work fucks. Comments of people buying 0dte calls successfully in the comments.\n\nAlso, someone stated GME 0dtes have been restricted for a year, so another possibility.",

Some of you might remember me from the first two run ups after the squeeze - where we had similar setups - on a much smaller scale. This time we are working with a weekly timeframe, and the **largest setup GME has had** since the squeeze.\n\nWhat you are looking at in red is a falling wedge (or as I like to call it when it extends this far down, a descending wedge). In this context, since it has retraced far more than 50% of the original move, it's a reversal pattern. What this means is, I would not look for a price target further than the top of the wedge @ 344 or so. There are three reactions (almost four now) to the top of the pattern, which makes this a very solid setup!\n\n**\\[ENTRY\\]**\n\nWeekly close (Friday) **greater than** 147.00.\n\n**\\[EXIT\\]**\n\nPrice targets are 200.00, 250.00, 300.00, 344.00. GME struggles to sustain pumps, so I would play it by ear and take profits the whole way up.\n\nStop loss on a Friday close **back under** 147.00.\n\n**\\[INSTRUMENT\\]**\n\nStock, since IV is always jacked to the fucking tits on this thing and you are overpaying for your options. Not to mention, so theta gang doesn't eat your tendies.\n\n\\---\n\nIt might not be a glamorous 1000 PT full send entry/setup - but it's the highest probability one I have seen in a while if you are interested in playing this stock. Keep in mind you must wait for the **entry** for the setup to have any merit. Until we get there, the stock is in a **steep downtrend biased towards more downside.**\n\nAlso remember, technical analysis is a roadmap of probabilities. These are not absolute predictions.\n\nKeep it simple.",

This is how companies like RobinHood, TDAmeritrade and Etrade are able to offer commission free trading. In a nutshell, they intend to shut it down.\n\nOut of one corner of their mouth they are claiming it is for our own good, that our orders are not being fulfilled at the best price because they are able to go to wholesale brokers directly rather than putting them up for auction. This allows them to make a fractional cent of money off each trade, which adds up enough to allow them to offer commission free trading.\n\nOut of the other corner of their mouth I am hearing that this could put commission free trading out of reach, shutting down the entire business model that allow it to exist. This would drastically tamp down on retail's ability to trade so much, which could make the markets less volatile.\n\nReally not sure how to interpret it so I ask some of you all who know better what the true intentions are. My interpretation is that it is intended to shut us down to prevent something like GME from ever happening again. And \"unintentionally\" keeps the status quo on wall street so us filthy plebs stop mucking it all up for the upper crust. For the good of all of us.",

Today, the Xbox team provided an update on our approach and vision, which included how we\u2019re making last year\u2019s vision a reality by bringing the Xbox app to Smart TVs, starting with our partner Samsung, the global leader in TVs.\n\nTogether, Samsung and Xbox partnered to bring Xbox Game Pass to the millions of Samsung Galaxy phones around the world, and now we are partnering again to bring our Xbox gaming experience to their 2022 Smart TVs. I\u2019m excited for you to experience cloud gaming on Smart TVs on June 30 in 27 countries.  \n\n\n The Xbox app on Smart TVs presents new opportunities to play:\n\n* If you are getting a new Samsung 2022 Smart TV, you will now have more ways to play games in your house.\n\n# If you\u2019re new to gaming, this is an easy way to get into the fun without needing to buy a PC or console and also to join a thriving community of over 25 million Game Pass members worldwide. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n[https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/06/09/xbox-app-for-smart-tvs/](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/06/09/xbox-app-for-smart-tvs/)",

    "title": "There's Going to be a Global Food Shortage, Here's How you can Make Money from It",
    "selftext": "Yo, heads up monkeys, this is going to be long and involve math,&gt;! (ok, I ended up using less math than originally planned because this would have turned into a spreadsheet, and I want to type that up as much as you want to read it, so either accept the %'s I'm giving you or spend weeks reading agriculture reports, your call homie)!&lt; you don't like it, the fucking back button is up there on your browser. Or just skip to the end where I put a one sentence summary.\n\nOh, and if you think I'm some full of shit doomer, I'd recommend you browse my profile and note just how many of those DD's (like my recent post on real estate) are coming true fully fucking accurate.\n\n**TL;DR: There's not enough food for everyone, people gonna get fucked like Marilyn Monroe at a Kennedy family reunion.**\n\nOk, so at this point everyone has noticed that the cost of food and gas is going up. This post is about food. As for gas... something's going on there, prices of gasoline and diesel have become completely disconnected from the cost of oil, reminds me a lot of what happened to California's electricity when Enron was fucking with supply, I haven't looked into the gasoline market at all, but the price of a barrel of oil vs. a gallon of gasoline is more whack than Flava Flav at an all night buffet of crack.\n\nSo, back to food. In order to invest correctly we need to figure out just how bad things are going to get, and to do that we need to answer a couple of questions.\n\n1. How much is supply getting restricted?\n2. How much is that going to affect the price of food?\n\nLet's start with the easier one, how much of a shortfall in food production are we looking at? Let's begin with the war in Ukraine. According to the USDA, in 2021 Ukraine produced 41,900,000 Metric Tons (MT) of Corn, 33,000,000 MT of Wheat, 31,643,00 MT of oilseeds, and 9,900,000 MT of Barley. In global export terms they ranked between #1 and #5 in each of those categories. Current USDA projections as of May 2022 have 19,500,000 MT of Corn, 21,500,000 of Wheat, 22,420,000 MT of oilseeds, and 6,000,000 MT of Barley. However, these projection numbers are constantly being revised down.\n\nUkraine's wheat crop is 97% winter wheat, and the harvesting of it is supposed to begin in July. The fields are also located in the South and East of the country, around cities like Mariupul, Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson. If those sound familiar, it's for a reason, they're where all the fighting is. Equally important is the fact that Russia is blockading the Black Sea, so it's not just Ukraine's exports being reduced, it's other countries like Serbia as well. Currently there are around 25,000,000 MT of various agricultural goods locked up in Ukrainian ports getting ready to start rotting in warehouses and silos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[It's a blockade.](https://preview.redd.it/t155o0bwrc591.jpg?width=290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820560a8bdf123b8cf381be848bb9366dc9c7c6f)\n\nCombining the blockade with the severe damage to the roads and bridges (remember the story about the heroic Ukrainian who blew that one key bridge? Nobodies rebuilt any of those for civilian use yet) and silos needed to harvest, transport, and store grain and other agricultural products, plus the prime areas of farmland and distribution being contested or under Russian control, and the harvest getting ready to not start at all in two weeks, I'm gonna say that Ukraine's exports this year will probably be close to zero. Even the optimistic projections of the USDA right now show enough lost production to completely offset the number of MT that Ukraine normally exports. Ukraine might honestly go from a top 3 worldwide food exporter last year to a net importer this year if things get bad enough.\n\nWell, what about places that aren't Ukraine you may be asking? Now lets get into another issue facing worldwide food production: Fertilizer shortages. Those of you who made money on the various fertilizer shortage DD's floating around here a couple months ago know what I'm talking about, global fertilizer production was down at least 30% this year thanks to things like Ice Storm Uri, Hurricane Ida, and of course the Ukraine War and resulting sanctions on Russia, China stopping all Urea exports, and plenty more, which led to prices more than doubling.\n\nNow, generally speaking, fertilizer is worth about a 50% increase in crop yields. So a 30% decline in supply comes out to a 15% drop in food production, plus the losses from Ukraine, which are worth about 5% of total world food production (7% of wheat), and we're at a 20% shortfall in worldwide food production. Sadly, there's more thanks to the weather. While most of America's farmland is in a drought, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri are actually getting too much rain, and its lasted so long that Soybean planting is way, way, way behind schedule.\n\nMeanwhile up in Canada, the planting season got delayed by a week due to heavy snow and rain, which means if there's an early frost the Canadian Spring Wheat crop is going to take a massive hit. Spring Wheat is 75% of Canada's yearly production. Meanwhile Canadian wheat exports are down 40% yoy right now due to decreased exportable supply, thanks to a 38% production reduction due in large part to COVID induced shortages.\n\nChina, another large crop producer, is facing significant problems with flooding this year, mainly in the southern provinces like Guanxi and Guangdong. Basically, everywhere along the Yangtze River is getting overloaded with too much water, which has caused damage to 30 million acres of crops. At a recent party meeting China's agricultural minister stated that conditions were the worst in history. None of this is helped by the corrupt and incompetent local and national governments that are doing a terrible job of mitigating the issues from flooding. For example, in Zhengzhou, despite warnings from meteorologists, little was done to mitigate flooding, leading to almost 1000 deaths across the region and scenes like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[That's... not right.](https://preview.redd.it/9ls2alktrc591.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5c9a4c6ea0826bc36f01c89de878e027e10cb67)\n\nUS food exports to China tripled between 2018 and 2021, which offset the big losses from the autumn floods last fall, but that isn't looking like a repeatable pattern given US production difficulties. Some of you might think I'm being overly critical of the CCP here - I'm not, feel free to read \"Document No. 1\" for 2022, it's their main document about agriculture and food production, and the first third of it is just praise for Xi \"Winnie the Flu\" Jinping and his great spirit and plans. The rest of it is full of nonsense like \"Do a good job in grain production\" - that's an actual quote from it btw. Just like the Soviets learned the hard way, the CCP is discovering that the kind of bureaucrats that survive loyalty purges aren't big on imagination or competence.\n\nSo let's talk about US crop production. Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, Montana, and Texas are all experiencing droughts, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa, and eastern Kansas are getting too much rain, which is doing things like significantly impacting the ability of farmers to plant the years soybean crop in time to harvest it before winter. While in the US none of these issues will stop production, they will reduce yields per acre, and the crops produced will likely be lower in protein content. Total area under cultivation in the US is only up 3% YoY from 2021. The yield loss from reduced fertilizer alone is 5x that amount.\n\nThere is a new problem that has recently appeared, and that's a shortage of DEF. DEF stands for Diesel Exhaust Fluid. The stuff makes diesel engines run cleaner at about a 10% cost in fuel efficiency.It's needed for any big rig truck or tractor or combine or harvester built after 2014. The engines won't run without it. A shortage means the planting and harvesting machines don't work, and the delivery and long haul trucks don't run. If this comes to pass, and hopefully it doesn't, the results will be catastrophic.\n\nI could go through a bunch more big agricultural countries, but it just gets kinda depressing, basically everyone who makes a lot of food is having significant production and weather issues this year.\n\nSo, adding all this up, conservatively, we get a 15% reduction from fertilizer shortages, 5% reduction from the Ukraine war, and 10% from weather (I'm using the same % from the '72 shortages because those were largely weather driven as well). And we get a relatively conservative estimate of a 30% reduction in global food production.\n\nThe last time there was a worldwide issue with food production was the Soviet Wheat Failure in the early 1970s. (There were also price spikes/output dips in 1994-1996 and 2006-2008) At the time US production was enough to offset the shortfalls in Europe and the USSR, but globally food prices increased by as much as 50%. That was on a roughly 10% decline in the production of wheat and other high protein grains. Today we're looking at at least a 30% decline in worldwide grain output, with the potential for slightly better or significantly worse numbers depending on the weather.\n\n**During the 1972 Wheat Collapse, global food prices increased as much as 50% on a 10% reduction in supply. Today we're facing an unknown price increase on a 30%+ reduction in supply.**\n\nIf you're wondering, yes I've tried bringing this to the attention of elected officials in both parties. The main reaction I got was a staffer stuttering in fear before quickly bailing on the conversation. They know what's coming, and have no idea how to deal with it.\n\nAs for specifically how high this is going to drive food prices? Honestly no idea beyond just up, like up a lot, food is an item with pretty inelastic demand, because people gotta eat. Also, food prices and crop prices aren't a 1:1 ratio, because of the high costs of shipping, markups, and spoilage. For example, a head of lettuce that costs $2 at the store might cost only $0.12 to grow. Meaning that even if the cost of producing lettuce doubled, the price you pay would only rise by 6%, not 100%.\n\nSo, now that you know there's massive food shortages incoming, how do you make the money? Don't worry, I'm here to tell you. The first and most obvious way is to buy calls on crop futures.\n\n\\[Banned name\\] is an ETF that tracks Wheat futures. (technically it only tracks Red Wheat, but in a shortage people will interchange and take whatever they can get) Here's a chart if you're into that kind of thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Triangle with a strong ascending support line.](https://preview.redd.it/9toa3j5prc591.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b236e91cdee4412aba52e6e93febbefb23220122)\n\nSOYB is an ETF that tracks Soybean futures. Obligatory chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ascending channel, and another triangle it's looking to break out of.](https://preview.redd.it/6g6ul4iorc591.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17b21054ef1d247e9859391fac9ab32951bb0694)\n\nCORN is an ETF that tracks Corn futures. Chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Looks like an inverse Head and Shoulders forming in an ascending channel.](https://preview.redd.it/yhpo9fwnrc591.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29e92dae2447f401c57dd6718d3d0743e1763501)\n\nGoing long on any of these I *highly*, *HIGHLY* recommend shares and calls out to Jan 2023. The harvests will start coming up short in the next few months, but this isn't happening tomorrow. Weekly FD's will get you rekt down to nothing. Listen to Soldier Boy's PSA from the 80s here except replace drugs with FD's. You don't want to be a loser do you?\n\nGoing long on agriculture is the obvious way to play this, but there's another option for everyone who missed out on the collapse of Russian ETFs after the start of the war in Ukraine. Well, you're going to get multiple shots at replicating that here. The Arab Spring started and Syria collapsed because of a drought and spiking food prices. That's going to start happening again on a much larger scale. What you're looking for are countries with stupid, incompetent leaders, fragile economies and societies, and that are already in economic trouble. These are almost guaranteed to implode into civil war and societal failure when things start getting really bad.\n\nSo who meets these criteria? And are reliant on foreign suppliers for food? Turkey, Egypt, China and Venezuela, come on down! You're the next contestants on \"Which badly run country will implode and flood their neighbors with refugees!\"\n\n**Turkey** \\- Erdogan is the guy who thinks that the best way to fight inflation is to print more money, and no, sadly, I'm not making that up. Now, Turkey does only import about 7% of it's food, but instability has a tendency to spread, there's a dedicated Turkey ETF \\[Banned Name\\] and the country is already suffering from hyperinflation and otherwise in shambles. Plus, they have a long history of military coups. Some generals gonna get froggy here sooner or later. Downside, \\[Banned Name\\] options only go out to November, and the chain is extremely illiquid.\n\n**Egypt** \\- El-Sisi is, frankly, an ass. Basically he's the Egyptian version of all the tin-pot dictators the US trained up for South and Central America back in the 80's. He took over in 2014 with a narrow victory of only 97% of the vote. He's only run against pro-government candidates since. They have their own ETF \\[Banned name\\], they're incredibly dependent on Ukranian grain - about 23% of their total food supply is imported. Downside, \\[Banned name\\] doesn't have options, so you can't buy puts.\n\n**Venezuela** \\- this is like the ultimate poster child for a country that's going to descend into (even more) chaos when food prices explode. Sadly, it's already such a basket case that the biggest ETF exposure to it I could find is 0.37%, which is pointless. But hey, if you can figure out a way to short this place, go for it.\n\nFinally, the big one, **China**.\n\nSeriously, China is beyond a mess. They're basically bankrupt, and their failed real estate companies are only held up by Wall Street being unable to get out of their long positions and forcing the ratings agencies to avoid giving them the \"D\" and triggering their bonds' cross default provisions. Xi is the most incompetent leader they've had since Mao, and he's managed to consolidate his power. They appear to have locked Shanghai back down to prevent bank runs from getting out of control, and foreign capital is fleeing while record floods devastate their food production and the official government response is a document that basically says \"try harder\" and \"don't fail\".\n\nThey have tons of very liquid ETF's to buy puts on. And even inverse ETFs to buy calls on. YANG for example is under $13 right now. Again, aim for a long time frame here, Jan 2023 should be your starting point.\n\nPersonally, I have a small position in OTM Jan 2023 YANG and \\[Banned name\\] calls, it's a side position to the well over 90% of my portfolio that's long GME.\n\n**Super Short Summary: Not enough food for everyone, bad things happen. Short emerging markets and the second and third world. Long agriculture futures.**\n\n*EDIT: Specific positions are 3x Jan 2023 18c in \\[Banned name\\] and 3x Jan 2023 40c in YANG.  I wasn't kidding when I said my positions here were small because most of my port is tied up in one security.*\n\n*Yeah, I'm aware of stuff like the dropping level of Lake Mead, the Italian issues with river flow dropping so much that seawater is backing up the channels and poisoning the ground, the food processing plant fires, and more.  I stopped writing about them because it was genuinely getting depressing.  There are many more options, tickers, and ways to play this than just what I listed here.*\n\n*But make no mistake, the food shortage is NOT priced in yet, and it's significantly worse than people are aware of.  And no, it won't be the end of civilization in first world countries.*\n\nEDIT: just more than doubled my positions. I'm buying the dip. As always, you're free to do what you want. 6/30/22.  I'm comfortable with my research and timeframe. Will continue to average down. Invest only what you're comfortable with. \n\n\\*\\*Sources include but not limited to: the USDA, the USDA FAS, Bloomberg, the Brookings Institute, and the CCP for their Document #1.",

    "title": "A contrarian opinion about the \u201cimminent recession\u201d",
    "selftext": "I don\u2019t know shit about fuck - If my opinion offends you, then you can click off now.\n\nMarkets are heavily influenced by psychology, as well as a multitude of other factors. Currently as of writing this, the S&amp;P 500 has corrected down approximately ~18% from ATH. This is quite the correction, enough so that many think we may experience a rough market downturn into recession.\n\nI hear many sentiments within these posts about future projections of how this recession will take place. *\u201dJust wait until the layoffs happen\u201d*, *\u201dPuts on anything are free money\u201d*, *\u201dCPI keeps going up it\u2019s clearly runaway inflation\u201d*, etc. However, all of these sentiments are based on previous recession indicators in from that had different economic situations.\n\nThe Great Depression in 1929 is still highly debated among economists of why it happened. Obviously the great stock market crash occurred at the beginning, and many different schools of economic thought describe this event as prescriptive of the depression or a consequence of the the depression. However what we do know is that stock market crash greatly reduced consumer savings, caused a lack of confidence in the financial services industry, run on banks, and eventual job losses. Ultimately what pulled out the US from depression was the start of World War II and the extreme surplus of GDP caused by wartime production.\n\n2008 was largely caused by the packaging of junk bonds and mortgage backed securities into their own basket which was rated by investment agencies as better than they actually were. Along with the abuse of derivatives by financial companies such as Lehman brothers, etc - a housing bubble was created and ultimately popped leaving the pain onto consumers while the government bailed out banks.\n\n2020 (mini COVID recession) a flight to safety occurred where money was pulled radically out of financial products due to an extreme lack of confidence in global supply chains and globalized companies due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Subsequent lockdowns caused layoffs, a decrease in consumer income, and shortages from supply chains (bull whip effect). The overall pandemic was considered bad enough that the government allowed for trillion dollars in Covid related aid as well as stimulus packages for common Americans.\n\nMany say we\u2019re heading into another recession because of the current market sell off and a multitude of factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, runaway inflation, and Shanghai lockdowns for Covid. Overall, things look pretty bad.\n\nBut, and many will roll their eyes at this statement, the stock market is the most forward looking indicator in our entire economy. Many believe that the market is the culmination of all information related to the US economy synthesized into industries and indexes with dollar values. There is one caveat to the stock market though, it caters to the top 1%. The wealthiest 10% of Americans hold 89% of all stock holdings. \n\n#Let me repeat, the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold 89% of all stock holdings.\n\nThe covid stimulus presented an interesting thought experiment that I will walk through based on the covid recession and why the stock market behaved as it did. After the crash, many of us believed it would take years for the sp500 to return to its previous levels, however looking at the chart, in a span of roughly 6 months we were back at ATH. I truly believe much of this upward price movement was due to the stimulus checks given during COVID and the large amount of quantitative easing by the federal reserve. Additionally, inflation was rising back then, and don\u2019t forget equities and financial assets are affected by inflation just as much, if not more by the increase in prices.\n\nNow we\u2019re in a period where the federal reserve is reducing treasury holdings, and high inflation is reducing consumer savings so they have less to invest. However, high inflation does not affect the top 10% of incomes in America. They simply reduce the amount of luxuries they spend on. We\u2019re also in a period called the \u201cgreat resignation\u201d, where the opportunity for remote work has caused a labor shortage since high skilled workers are able to work at companies at a national scale without having to move locations. I believe this is more reasoning that we are *not* heading towards recession.\n\nWill there be job losses? Yes. But not for the people that it matters. See, everyone knows that America has been trending towards the middle class shrinking and causing a split where you are either a high income earner, or you are below the poverty level. This has increased over time due to student loans causing even middle income earners stuck living pay check to pay check from debt repayments. I believe much of the sell off is due to retail investors being pressured from high inflation to sell their savings for liquid cash to purchase gas and groceries. Don\u2019t forget, an extra 2400 in your pocket from Covid, and more if you claimed unemployment, caused a rapid increase in retail holdings in the stock market - especially during the rise of \u201cmeme stocks\u201d. Side bar, like bro I was in a fuckin Uber and he\u2019s asking me about what I think about AMC or GME, like wtf. The market experienced mania after the Covid crash, with retail buying anything and everything from shitcoins, AMC, to egg future contracts with no plans to actually own the commodity. And now, retail is selling out from the need of short term liquidity to fulfill basic needs like food and gas.\n\nHowever, the top 10% of Americans aren\u2019t as fearful as during Covid and pulling out of their 401ks or retirement funds. Financial services companies like Goldman or vanguard are actually hiring at a more rapid pace right now due to the large amount of high skilled workers looking for new jobs. The only people, as always in American, that are going to be hurt are the lowest 25% of incomes. There\u2019s a common adage in the finance industry that says, \u201csell in May and go away\u201d. After this mania occurred, market cycles still continue as normal, except normal market cycle sell offs are magnified by first time inexperienced retail investors cashing out their investments bought during the mania, in fear of losing it all and missing out on the opportunity cost of buying the goods they need to survive. I truly believe, this downswing will not last as long as we believed. Don\u2019t forget the news will always be bearish during market downturns, but these media companies typically skew the opposite of what smart money or big money is doing in the market. I\u2019m not saying next week SPY will go racing to ATHs again. I\u2019m saying the combined unique scenario of pumping the average Americans wallets with Covid relief money during a time when our orange man was saying V-shaped recovery and inflation pumping equity prices may result in a normal correction - but not a recession. Despite what everyone says, the job market is actually very strong for skilled workers right now. Many of these workers are seeing 10 to 20% salary increases from switching companies. While layoffs occur, most of the higher income Americans right now are doing excellent in this economy. Which means, eventually people will buy this dip, and retail will feel left out again because they panic sold while big money and smart money laughed at them. This all goes back to my sentiment that the market has a lot of psychology involved, and the mania experienced during Covid with meme stocks and free money caused a rapid increase which obviously needed to correct down again, but don\u2019t expect recession right away.\n\nI will say, anyone who bought leap calls during the falling knife of Covid would\u2019ve been extremely profitable, or even just dollar cost averaging shares. My honest opinion is probably by October we\u2019ll see a strong bull market again, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to just see some large swings in both directions with an overall sideways movement in the stock market from now own. The market is going to bleed out retail and then big money is going to move in like it\u2019s always been. My advice would be don\u2019t be too bearish, because there will be a time when big money cycles back into equities. \n\nTLDR: high inflation hurts the lowest 25% of Americans the most. The highest 10% of incomes own 89% of stock market holdings. Labor market is strong for high skilled workers. Recession may not be imminent, but retail getting caught holding the bag definitely is.",

    "title": "What are SWAPS, and how does it move the market?",
    "selftext": "I want to preface this post with an observation I have made recently regarding swaps and perfect hedging between certain 'meme' stocks. In these posts, the author attempts to show why two stocks are perfect hedges against each other by showing charts that illustrate positive correlation between market cap, delta change, and suspect runs by one or the other.\n\nThe FUD that has been going around is regarding GME and AMC, so I will address that example in this post.\n\nOn initial read, these posts are quite convincing, but when combined with a bit of logic, they fall apart. It is a great logical fallacy to have a predetermined conclusion and search to find data correlations to support the expected outcome. There will always be data to support any predetermined outcome if you can illustrate it in the correct manner. (This is very present in cults, or extremist groups)\n\n\u200b\n\nNow for SWAPS... By definition \"A swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange sequences of cash flows for a set period of time.\"\n\nSee below for reference.  I will quote this page multiple times:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/swaps.asp\n\nNow what makes a swap beneficial to be a participant in? \"Consider a bank, which pays a floating rate of interest on deposits (e.g., liabilities) and earns a fixed rate of interest on loans (e.g., assets). This mismatch between assets and liabilities can cause tremendous difficulties. The bank could use a fixed-pay swap (pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate) to convert its fixed-rate assets into floating-rate assets, which would match up well with its floating-rate liabilities.\"\n\nWell that is for banks, but what about stocks? If one party has risky assets but needs to take a low risk position, they swap their risky assets with a lower risk security or bond with another participant that willing to accept the higher risk.\n\nOne critical piece of swaps is that the party accepting the risk of a security does not \"own\" that security. Short reporting requirements require a shorts to be reported if they are &gt;5% of the float of the stock. If a SHF wants to short a company  into the ground, they can go short 4.9% and then swap with 19 other counter parties, each at 4.9% short to be near 100% short on the stock. None of this has to ever be reported. The only reporting required is that a swap between the securities took place, which conveniently has been held from the public.\n\nAccording to https://www.sec.gov/swaps-chart/swaps-chart.pdf\n\n'Security based swaps' are reported to the SEC, while the CFTC regulates 'swaps'. One key difference between the reporting is that the SEC does not require valuation reporting.\n\nhttps://www.kaizenreporting.com/sbsr-sec-swap-reporting-the-long-journey/\n\nNow back to the GME/AMC perfect hedge theory.\n\n\"A perfect hedge is a position by an investor that eliminates the risk of an existing position, or a position that eliminates all market risk from a portfolio. Rarely achieved, a perfect hedge position needs to have a 100% inverse correlation to the initial position.\"\n\nFor a perfect hedge, the losses in one would need to be perfectly paired with the gains in the other.  A simple glance at the chart and this is obviously not the case. In fact, it is the INVERSE of a perfect hedge. The two stocks are most likely involved in something called 'bucket swaps', where a group of securities are lumped together by risk index and swapped with another bucket with a different risk index. Both stocks were likely over shorted (along with several others) by using these bucket swaps for a long time. The benefit of lumping multiple stocks together in a bucket also goes back to reporting requirements. Lumping multiple stocks into a bucket obfuscates the value of each stock in the bucket and reporting for bucket swaps is good as useless. The participants can swap buckets back and forth with nobody besides the participants ever knowing what is contained in the buckets.\n\n\nI cannot find any stocks with near perfect inverse correlations to our favorite bucket stocks, so they are likely swapped with an alternate form of currency, or are hidden in the much larger and more stable blue chip stocks...\n\nThe swaps market is so large that in 2019, the notional amount was over 341 TRILLION.  In comparison the global GDP currently is 84.71 Trillion.  Leverage much????\n\nI will conclude this with my theory that GME and the other 'meme' stocks are mostly lumped in a swap agreement called Equity swaps, and are lumped into multiple different baskets as well to include popular indices (could this be a large contributing factor to why everything follows the SPY???  Probably above my pay grade...).\n\nHere's what equity swaps are:\n\n\"An equity swap is similar to an interest rate swap, but rather than one leg being the \"fixed\" side, it is based on the return of an equity index. For example, one party will pay the floating leg (typically linked to LIBOR) and receive the returns on a pre-agreed-upon index of stocks relative to the notional amount of the contract.\n\nIf the index traded at a value of 500 at inception on a notional amount of $1,000,000, and after three months the index is now valued at 550, the value of the swap to the index receiving party has increased by 10% (assuming LIBOR has not changed). Equity swaps can be based upon popular global indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000 or can be made up of a customized basket of securities decided upon by the counterparties.\"\n\n\nSwap reporting requirements can be found at the link below... but it is written using legal jargon that makes it near impossible for the average person to make any sense out of.\n\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-11-25/pdf/2020-21569.pdf\n\n\nI am completely open to anybody disputing my theory or adding to anything I missed. If you want to argue any points, I would love to go at it. Please give supporting documentation if you disagree with any of my statements.\n\nTL;DR - that sucks, I guess you will never know what swaps are.",

Blue : RRP , Orange : 4wBill](https://preview.redd.it/l8ebfr3cbb591.png?width=1587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c85c61e0473a7bd07b242eb35c5d07c07f6efc3)\n\nT-Bill : What only just few people on the Wallstreet know is that less than 90D T-Bills, mostly 4 week and 8 week treasuries, can be considered cash equivalents. We discussed this in our last post that T-Bill were trading lower than rrp in yields because the treasury cut issuance and not the case that MMF were buying it. Hence, due to low yields it was kinda creating a perception that someone is buying it. Hence 10yr bonds were trading around 2.7-2.8%. But now, my friends things have gotten serious; the rrp yields have now gone down lower than the short term T-Bills. Meaning the money is parked in reverse repo facility (excess liquidity ) waiting for Hfs to borrow it so that they can buy longer duration treasuries with it. But will they remain, the case remains to be seen for smoother QT. ( They got smoked on a \"Basis Harvesting\" trade in 2020)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDxy : We have already discussed this way before. Sorry guys due to max limit of 20images i cannot post this. But you guys know where I stand. Its in a 20yr Wyckoff accumulation pattern. Meaning it should in theory go to $120, but at what cost. And will it break it. The answer is idk. Technicals say it should, but c'mon guys. $120 would mean idk Great Depression, but then why did dollar go down in tech bubble. Shouldn't it have gone up kinda like today. But the capitulation started when people lost faith in Dxy. And also this time we have the ECB hike meaning the mirror theory of Dxy and Eurusd. So in all its complicated, but lets break it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFaith lost in Dxy : Hence Dxy below $100 and also the price of assets capitulates. Eurusd will be up.\n\nFaith maintained in Dxy : Go past $120 and also the price of assets capitulates. Eurusd will go down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApple : Guys who are new, please don't say Tesla. It has to prove the test of time to be called as cash equivalent in stocks. We are still gonna go with Apple. But guys i discussed this last to last time that even though guys, you might see an inverse h&amp;S doesn't mean it will go up. You have to look at the bigger picture why is apple stocks volume going down but prices going up since 2008. The answer is simple. It's called index buying. But since the latest data shows index buying has gone down compared to individual stock buying things have gotten complicated. Apple imo could very well go to $128 and then further down. Also, that Q3 earnings imo won't look good. Tim already warned us before, hence Burry is still shorting it. You can see my more detailed analysis of Apple in WS newsletter 5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Marking our boundaries in stock market indices**\n\nWe all know there are 4 indices on WallStreet that everyone has their eyes on. It's the S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq, the most watched. Next are Dow Jones and Russell 2000. But guys, we should give more importance to the last 2. Maybe they will tell us a good story. As you all know russell gave its peak in October 2022, followed by Nasdaq and then S&amp;P500. And dow jones somewhere b/w nasdaq and S&amp;P500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo leading indicators are : RTY , NDQ , DJI , SPX. So lets dive in and create boundaries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DJI : 1929 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/0pcrduupgb591.png?width=1821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=decb9e146477a4c321f3343328b86d4d39633eab)\n\n**Dow Jones :** \n\nOmg what is that and how horrible does it look must be the first reaction from you guys. But guys take a chill pill, i will explain it. You see, every billion dollar company has that motto. Expect the bad, but prepare for the worst. Hence I took that advice for my charts. The least % of our fallen indices is Dow Jones around 10-12%. Hence I took that and went as far as history I could find. There I saw in the period 1929-1933, the Dow fell -89% to -90%. This was called as Great Depression period, as you all must know. Cool thing is, depression happens over 90yr+ cycles. One happened in 1839, the next one in 1929, and then we could have seen the start in 2019, but our Fed being Fed, started saving us because then pandemic hit. So if that saving is going away in 2022, we should prepare for it in 2022. And it's coming guys. You can't stop it. It's either here in 2022 or it will come in 2029. Man, those charts look similar. Let me explain how.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The one on the left is trading at a 5 sigma bubble, whereas the present one is a 4-sigma std deviation bubble. Both are bubble honestly.\n\n\\- The Stoch RSI kinda gave it away. 1 and 2 are your bottoms, which are also called bottoms of \"Expanded flat\" correction pattern. ( There are three types : Regular, Expanded and running flat. The two tops and two bottoms and after that one giant move up and then come crashing down ) On the left and right we can see b/w 4 and 5. There is kinda a double top and breaking of neckline which suggests depression coming in after neckline break.\n\n\\- The RSI divergences and double tops also predicted respective tops of the bull market in monthly candles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you kinda want to ignore all of this shit, but you really can't. Look guys, i didn't mean to do this, but it is what it is. Btw don't sell right now. Make a decision in August 2022.\n\nNote : $4200-4300. This shall be your bottom. The price will at least come here if Depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NDX : 2000 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/0jyts0cwvb591.png?width=1821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cecbffed54b74469fd5441c61c2879c4d5cfc3f2)\n\n**Nasdaq :** \n\nI didn't really want to scare you guys up there, but I had to. It's my job as an analyst to give you first the worst case scenario. So now lets tone down a bit to mid case scenario. The one I call Forgotten Depression of 1921 or Dotcom bubble of 2000. Let's be honest guys tech is in a bubble. when you are in a bubble you crash -83% that is the rule the Illuminatis of this world have decided. You see it all around you in Voldemort class of assets. ( the one I shall not name here ) It originated from the idea created in the dot com bubble. So let's discuss some key points regarding this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Both of the charts show kind of an S-curve. What happens in this is you have a significant higher growth rate at the beginning, so you pull all the10yr earnings before and then go into a tech recession where only the strong companies scathe out alive. The rest shall be burnt as peacing to the peasant gods. Amazon did it in 2000. Let's see who does it in 2022.\n\n\\- The tech bottom is b/w range of 0.786 and 0.886 in fib retracement. Or you can just go with my favorite 200MMA. You're never gonna go wrong with this. Hence on the right you can see i created two bottoms. I am not sure which one of them is absolute bottom, but one of them surely is.\n\n\\- RSI as you can see, has broken that white line, which is the historical RSI averages of last 14yrs.\n\n\\- Stochastic RSI is in deep water and will swim there for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : $3000 or $5000 shall be your tech recession bottom. Also, why am I saying this is in a bubble for sure. Here's something you guys need to do. Open trading view and make a composite function of SPX/USM2, NDX/USM2, DJI/USM2 and RTY/USM2. You will have your answer. (  I can only do 20max picture here. Sorry ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dividing by M2 money supply : NDX\\/USM2 vs SPX\\/USM2](https://preview.redd.it/v8aet9b81c591.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a578bd4723c6fd8206210dc6b5e2d3330e0c4c)\n\nOmg these manipulators are everywhere. First, they did that crazy thing with curve inversion before russian invaded ukraine. Yes guys, it wasn't April 2022 when the curve inverted. It was a fuckin February alright. I saw it, its on my twitter. Now we can't make M2 composite function. Fuck you Govt. Guys here, i will share it. I made it last yr. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPX : 2008 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/m5quvvbf6c591.png?width=1821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c297c59d1d4dcf4e11cd536b82428fc3a0bd25)\n\n**SPX500 :**\n\nSo now, guys, I will tone it down a bit more. But it's honestly the same. Let's call this one the Global Financial Crisis. The equivalent mid case scenario. Most of you guys now will be like, you gotta be joking. This is most of our worst case scenario. No guys, this is not the worst case. This is the equivalent mid case with V-shaped recovery at the bottom, like in 2008. Worst case scenario is your Greater Depression. This one is what our pal Jamie is warning us about the hurricane on the horizon, and the government doesn't even wanna accept this mid-case one. Why do I call it equivalent, you may ask. The answer is beta. SPX is down -22% i guess, and our tech is down -30%. So i guess we roughly assume 20 and 30% our beta is 1.5. So just assuming our beta remains constant throughout the whole crisis, then if tech falls roughly around 80% then our SPX must be hovering around 53-55% which is exactly what our global  financial crisis should be. And guys, it's not like I haven't told you all this before. We are just repeating most of the things from previous posts and most of our famous economists and youtubers are catching up now. Some key points to remember here again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- That white line you see, i.e. 50MMA expect a bounce to upside from here in June, and then July and August will be green. My swing theory is based on this. But what I don't know is, will 50MMA come this month. What i am sure is about monthly green candles on SPX. So yes, indexes are safer for two months, but you might get more returns to upside in stocks, but you need to be sure to pick the right ones and not the ones where an FUD can be originated. Am I clear guys?\n\n\\- The RSI has a history of bounces from the 40-43 region and our stochastic RSI has bottomed almost and will shoot up but not come out of deep water like 2008.\n\n\\- Even the chart pattern is similar if you exclude out the covid anomaly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : The bottom here will be 200MMA at least i.e., roughly in the -50% range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Just looking back at Russell ](https://preview.redd.it/dlt6nl5vdc591.png?width=1827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d013a0f997715e965b0310d17dab84fd895cd348)\n\n**Russell 2000 :**\n\nIt's the leading indicator guys. So what can I do with it. There is nothing do here. Lets just now discuss the similarity we are seeing in Russell to the 2008 crisis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- First we touched 50MMA, then bounced up and then touched 100MMA and bounced to a new ATH and now we are finally heading towards 200MMA. That's it guys.\n\n\\- The RSI are now heading towards deep water. Wake me up when it does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : The bottom is $1100 or below, roughly -56%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion : \n\n\\- This was just a reminder to not forget where we are headed in the long term. -50% is coming in all indices. I will stand by my predictions. Also, a short term rally to the upside is just on the horizon so please build up cash and we are gonna short together starting August-September 2022.\n\n\\- This was all based on historical analysis. The real present analysis is simple guys. I will tweet about it if I get time. Can't do it here because of image limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Preparing for the worst in bond markets**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TLT buy date : May 15 - June 15 window](https://preview.redd.it/lslwb1vuhc591.png?width=1585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd6ff883a37f8e9d933f722d34aef37825bf0cb2)\n\nI'm pretty sure it has been a million times already that i have posted this chart everywhere. Surely by now everyone has got that at least 3.10% 20yr bond TLT making the average price roughly around $113-114. I told you to buy this bond b/w May 15-June 15. We are almost there. But guys, just in case this QT, i.e. Quantitative tightening for $47.5B/m for next 3months starting June 15 ( Yes, it hasn't even started yet. TB matures mid June and MBS at end of June) isn't priced in, then bonds are in trouble. I will take full responsibility for this ( because i told you all markets prices things beforehand), but i will take no responsibility for a volcker shock. I already have said this before \"Volcker shock\" will hammer bonds and equities together because you're jacking interest rates. This also won't be good for Gold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the reason why I tell you guys to buy this long term treasury bond is pretty simple.\n\n\\- At some pt in the 95B/m which has never happened in history, will blow up repo or rrp facility. Or something else will break, and hence for that reason at the end of QT we see that long duration trade step up in the market, causing the stocks to sell off more and TLT to go up in prices. In short Long duration trade will swamp the market.\n\n\\- The second reason to buy TLT is growth will slow down in future and deflation will come. For that purpose you buy bonds. It's gonna be even better than buying dividend stocks whose average returns are 4%.\n\n\\- The third reason i tell you to buy bonds is if a financial crisis happens like 2008 or tech bubble of 2000 implosion or even a greater depression of 1929 this will swamp up the longer duration trade. You can see the charts for 10yr bonds to show you that.\n\n\\- The final reason I tell you to buy is to look at Japan in the 80s. We are kinda doing the same thing and Fed longer term goal is to go for yield controls i..e buying bonds again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason you shouldn't\n\n\\- Inflation is going to 10% or above and we need a \" Volcker shock \" to bring inflation down. ( Jack up to 8%. I am crazy, i know )\n\n\\- In order to combat high inflation, we keep changing the definition of neutral rates or terminal rates because Fed has to go above neutral. But what is even neutral. It's bonkers. ( 2.5% or 3% ? )\n\n\\- I am wrong and QT isn't priced in. (47.5B/m and 95B/m )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion : Don't blow up entire money on 3.1-3.2% bonds. Maybe we could get 4% or even 8-10% in \"Volcker shock\". So I guess, save some money for the reasons you shouldn't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **A dive into metals and commodities**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Metals :** \n\n2008  ( Financial crisis : Already discussed )\n\nThose who are new might not know this, but certainly the old ones do. Buy Gold at financial crisis bottom because gold too falls in financial crisis like 2008. Bonds don't. But after financial crisis to about 2-3 yrs gold outperforms bonds and indices. So buy it after -50% in equities. That's how we will be creating wealth for the future.\n\nAlso, like bonds gold doesn't like rising interest rates. Don't forget it. But this has been discussed before. Lets learn something new today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart : Gold, Orange line : Inflation, Yellow line : SPX](https://preview.redd.it/tauv5vu4ek591.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22bdc0a3458f57265691fe0bab717bcc1a54467)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1970's - 1980's ( Stagflation comparison )\n\nAs you can see the first thing from this chart is two orange peak up way back in 1970-1980. I think you guys know what period it was. It was called the \"Stagflation of the 70's\". So how did stagflation happen? Some say it was due to oil shocks like kinda we are being told it is due to Russia's partial oil embargoes. But do you guys know what happened in 1970-71. Our President Nixon took us away from the gold standard. Yes, friends, it was the day when everyone thought the stock market should go down but instead we went up, and finally it led to that first peak of inflation in the same way our money printing of 2020 led to that first rising peak of our current inflation. But you have to know that inflation and stocks only go up to that certain time so that it doesn't impact forward earnings. After that, stocks go down even as inflation ticks up. So what does this chart tell us? It tells us Gold is the best fucking asset out there to own in a stagflation period. Not bonds not stocks. Just gold. So if gold is the best out there then i guess silver is your low cap gold which will absolutely rip in this stagflation doing a 10x in a period of 2022-2030. (Because they all move slowly)\n\nBut there's always a catch. If inflation as we know it has peaked already, then gold and silver are coming crashing down and making a double bottom while stocks go up, making the current bottom of first peak inflation as absolute bottom. And then we decide if a second peak in inflation is coming in or not. If the answer is yes, metals will go up and stocks will go down, but never touching the first absolute bottom. Hence, stocks will become volatile this decade and go up, and so will metals. But bonds man, they are gonna get smoked if inflation isn't under control. Because nominal yields = inflation + growth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent 2022 : [https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-may-2022](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-may-2022)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can read the full detailed high level analysis of Gold commentary in May. I'm just going to provide a summary of that ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay highlights \n\n\\- Strong bi-directional equity volatility failed to support gold prices as short term momentum waned.\n\n\\- Outflows of global gold ETF's totaled 53t ( US $3.1bn ) in May, losing 1.3% of assets; in contrast, US Mint coin sales rebounded and remain strong y-t-d.\n\nLooking forward\n\n\\- Gold prices seasonally have shifted in recent years, suggesting a historically strong late summer rally may come sooner that normal.\n\n\\- The ten worst quarters of equity performance have been met with positive gold returns in all but one instance. Current Q2 performance would rank in the bottom 20, yet gold is lower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Commodities :** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Commodity index](https://preview.redd.it/ct6xj23dqk591.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11336ab6a39e6c4ec88702a092f46a32716a406a)\n\nThis is your goldman commodity index. Lets dive in the story of this chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- In order to confirm that a commodity bull cycle is coming soon, we need a monthly close candle above the 2008 highs like 2003. Otherwise, it's still years to come like 2000. ( The 2000 and 2003 were trying to break the 1990 commodity top)\n\n\\- But what is certain here is it's at the top of the cycle and we are about to fall -20% or -30%+ from here. Meaning shorting the commodity index is a good freakin trade right now, especially considering inventories are building up and china will reopen soon. But oil shall be very complicated. I wouldn't advise shorting Oil right now ( you can gamble at $140 though. It's your choice ) because China's opening could put extra demand side pressure on Oil considering supply, or we can say inventories aren't building up here. Also, this green initiative we keep talking about is actually bullish for both and Oil and green energy prices. Oil gets benefit from supply cuts ( government be like stop carbon go green ) and green energy takes advantage of demand bursts. And then this will jack up the prices so much that countries will go back to coal coz its cheap and then green energy revolution eventually becomes carbon energy revolution. It's all in circles. Btw, I am just throwing darts here. Don't take this personally with me in comments section. Take this to the government.\n\n\\- Notice the stochastic RSI similarities to 2008. Both were in June. meaning that fake exit liq rally is coming and then we crash in october. We will be tricking investors by making commodity prices go down and which in turn will help inflation come down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Checking Housing Index**\n\nHousing : [https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market#overview](https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market#overview)\n\nGuys this time around i won't give you some stupid chart with only three variables involved, i.e. housing prices relative to income. 10Yr or 30yr treasury bonds, or MBS . inventories. But this time you guys will see for yourself what is happening in the housing market. So click on the above link.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overview :**\n\nJump into this website to see for yourself. Median sale price is up 15.3% yoy, whereas the number of homes sold is -11.7% yoy. Also, the 30yr fixed mortgage rate is 5% but this has changed recently i believe. It's 6.13% as of June 13. You can also see the demand and supply side of things with the conclusion given too. All I would like to say is this data is lagging. It's showing April data, so don't get confused because of this. You need to see the mom data to actually know how fast things have changed from April to June. And if you did you would know housing is next after Voldemort, bonds, stocks.\n\nThis is your S&amp;P shiller index ; [https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/data/case-shiller-home-prices](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/data/case-shiller-home-prices)\n\nand this website is cool too, like redfin. But do you wanna know a secret. If you check the NAHB index, you might see a divergence in NAHB and shiller. Kinda cool. Meaning we are about to fall like 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**News :** \n\nAlso, we know mortgage payment/ m is rising whereas rent prices are still flat/m. Expect rent prices to go up as well\n\n [redfin.com/news/redfin-rental-report-may-2022/](https://redfin.com/news/redfin-rental-report-may-2022/)\n\nLuxury home sales have already started sinking. -18%\n\n[https://www.redfin.com/news/luxury-home-sales-april-2022/](https://www.redfin.com/news/luxury-home-sales-april-2022/)\n\nBe aware of this adjustable rate mortgage trap. Don't do it.

Don't buy home in 2022. Wait for 2023-24.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reason :** \n\nInventories : Are Going Up, but Inflation : Is Also Going Up. Kinda contradictory, but this is what is happening all because of oil and money printing.\n\nSo Mortgage : Go up because Fed is on a hike cycle. Also Employment : Go up. Tightening labor markets but also dying liquidity and trouble for companies as they prepare for recession.\n\nHence Home sales : Decline but  Rent prices : Go up, forcing those rent payers to buy homes in 2023-24.\n\nBut if for some reason no one is willing to buy homes (an economic down thrust) at high mortgage rates, then we could see a death spiral. Supply keeps going up like a ponzi coin and demand is almost negligible. So prices will readjust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LHS : US employment vs Housing index, RHS : Mortgage applications vs housing index](https://preview.redd.it/ga066i7ufl591.png?width=1912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e44cd09f6c2978e0695521a8a371a4b7f50f8aac)\n\nOh my god, did i miss any of my charts for housing. I was going to, but I found this really cool stuff. In 2008-2012, unemployment rose and I mean tremendously. We are nowhere near it. Nowhere. So my point being, why did the mortgage application go sky high? It couldn't have been middle class or lower coz. How could they. They were busy saving. So who bought these. Maybe \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  So, my friends, when you see the breakout in mortgage applications with unemployment high. huh but this Turkey thing is bothering me. So lets make it only breakout in mortgages. When you see that in the data, you buy a house. No questions asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Looking at Geopolitics chart.

A noob guy like me would answer that there is no difference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the numerator we have IEI, i.e., an ETF that measures 3-7yr treasury bonds, whereas TLT is an ETF for 20yr treasury bonds.\n\nOn the denominator we have HYG, which measures the price of high yield corporate bonds, whereas JNK means junk bonds. The difference b/w the two of them is HYG has a higher cash holding i.e. 1.1% as compared to JNK 0.15%. Consumer cyclical holdings are similar, but a difference in 18.5% and 16.5% in communications, respectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe LHS chart shows the spread is widening and has reached its highest value since the decline it made off its 2020 high (The 2020 stock market lows). A higher IEI/HYG spread means the prices for Treasury bonds are higher than prices for Junk bonds. The current rising spread shows the ongoing flight from riskier corporate backed debt into safer government-backed debt.\u00a0This isn\u2019t too surprising as institutions have been derisking for months due to interest rates and CPI rising, but it further illustrates the poor institutional sentiment for owning risk assets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe RHS chart shows a similar thing. The only difference is the taste of investors to make predictions on what chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo know further more about them, you can read it here. ( Since I am a noob)\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/2684995-you-are-using-hyg-and-jnk-all-wrong-here-is-what-to-do-about-it](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2684995-you-are-using-hyg-and-jnk-all-wrong-here-is-what-to-do-about-it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me just give you an example of how to use this technique to our advantage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[HYG vs SPX](https://preview.redd.it/s4hovr57dm591.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebba70c28b8424ef4c1e183c84825519f091b4fe)\n\nAs you can see when we see the divergence in this graph b/w S&amp;P500 and HYG, then something needs to correct itself. Look at the 2014-15 period HYG started to make a lower high, but the stock market went up. This means the companies have started planning for some downturn. And then a few months later, you can see the decline started to happen in the stock market. The same was the case in 2018 and now 2021-22.\n\nSo we can use this theory to our advantage when HYG makes a higher low or double bottom but the stock market makes a lower low, then you can witness an upside rally in the stock market. Also, this rate of change indicator can come in very handy. You see, it needs to go down to 2008 levels and then make a higher low. And that, my friends, will be the bottom of the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Yield curves ( Just 10-2 yr and 30-5 yr)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LHS : 10-2yr, RHS : 30-5yr](https://preview.redd.it/n0dcxmu2kl591.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=217437c404030b1c4d046da0cf9c0be317a8e9a7)\n\nJust posting to let you guys know curves have reinverted again, meaning they are making those dangerous log down lines we keep talking about since the start of this year. I know Fed keeps talking about the 10-3month. Well, since I don't trust them, I don't want to look where they want me to look. Instead, I look at the 1yr forward curve called 30-5yr. I dont even know why, but I saw one analyst look at it and give detailed analysis. So Hmmm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **VIX Call me...!!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LHS : VIX, RHS : Call options](https://preview.redd.it/g8iyy2oqml591.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7b0f307f0a850278b307caa853c50d062d3fb2d)\n\nSmall traders buying call options have nearly evaporated. As for the VIX, well, unless it goes to 40 or 50, we ain't gonna see the bottom. Also look at the RSI, it's not even ticked up. As for stochastic RSI on monthly, it's at top and will go down in b/w June-September sharply. And then Q4 will be bloody hell upon the market when RSI shoots up to 80+ with stochastic RSI up and hence VIX index up to 40+.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Others**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[June is the baddest month in mid term elections \\( another reason for bottom is here \\) , unemployment ticking up. ](https://preview.redd.it/wrre4tkofm591.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afd23b6ec7828397e033a29b1041b36cd47f8a11)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fed rates impacting BOJ](https://preview.redd.it/c0g9xl4mjm591.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d0ca19381f3469f668441da88736909260e326b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see, Fed swap market is pricing in 190bps for the next three meetings and it has then again impacted our terminal rates, which were 3.2% before but are now projecting 3.8%-3.9% by August 2023 and 3.45% by the end of the year. You can check this data for yourselves by contructing a composite function. ZQF2022-ZQZ2022 will give you terminal rates by December and ZQF2022-ZQQ2023 will give you rates by August 2023. So if you go a step further till September 2023 and October 2023, you shall see that the rate projection is actually going down. That means the Fed traders are pricing the rate hike cycle to end by somewhere b/w august 2023 to september 2023. This is what that graph in b/w suggest so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this all USA rate hike cycle then in turn is impacting our Dollar. The dollar is going up, so hence the DXY index is going up. Since the dollar has a major percentage in Dxy. This in turn is causing Euro, JPY and other currencies to plummet against the dollar. So the countries that arent hiking rates, for example Japanese Yen or JPY, is getting destroyed and ripped apart by the dollar. Look at the JPYUSD on the right. It's going to the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The final Result :** **TL;DR**\n\nLet's wait for Powell tomorrow and see if we get our expect 75bps but get a 50bps rally or not. If we do then the bottom will be June 14 or 15. \n\nIf we get 75bps then the bottom will be somewhere in the last week of June.\n\nJuly is going to be green and august peak of the bear market rally. Crash starts August-September 2022 once this heavy bulldozer like balance sheet starts getting removed. Then we can have -20% swings in one Mondeathday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thank you guys for making it this far.**\n\nWith lots of love.\n\nRegards \n\nUchiha ( First member of Akatsuki )",

    "selftext": "Last year, I recommended a highly regarded, diverse, equitable and inclusive portfolio, [God Tier DD, Buy NOW &amp; Get Rich Monday. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n77rdn/god_tier_dd_buy_now_get_rich_monday/)\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the holdings' year to date performance. Now this is huge!\n\nTSLA \ud83d\udca5 623.31 \u27a1\ufe0f 639.30 \ud83d\udcc8 +4%\n\nGME \ud83c\udfae 152.84 \u27a1\ufe0f 125.73 \ud83d\udcc9 -18%\n\nARKK \ud83e\udeb5 96.99 \u27a1\ufe0f 36.98 \ud83d\udcc9 -38% \n\nPLTR \ud83e\udddb 26.78 \u27a1\ufe0f 7.67 \ud83d\udcc9 -71%\n\nBANNED \ud83d\udcbe 18.84 \u27a1\ufe0f 3.54 \ud83d\udcc9 -81% \n\nCLOV \ud83c\udf40 12.97 \u27a1\ufe0f 2.12 \ud83d\udcc9 -84%\n\nRKT \ud83d\ude80 10.71 \u27a1\ufe0f 1.18 \ud83d\udcc9 -89%\n\nBANNED \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbc 10.71 \u27a1\ufe0f 1.18 \ud83d\udcc9 -89%  \n\nPTON \ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffc 121.60 \u27a1\ufe0f 9.45 \ud83d\udcc9 -92% \n\nIf you bought 1 share of each company last year for a total of $1074.75, then today you've have $827.15! With a loss of 25%, this portfolio is doing just slightly worse than market indexes for 2022. \ud83d\udcb8 \ud83d\udcb8 \ud83d\udcb8\n\nRemoving outliers (TSLA), we're down 83% to $187.85. As Warren Buffet says, some stocks can keep your whole portfolio afloat and thankfully TSLA is that stock and Elon is the levelheaded leader we need to go to the moon! \ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't buy any shares in any companies and what I bought expired worthless (gourds). *Don't worry apes,* I DRS'd my GME shares in April, but unfortunately I lost the paper certificates on Christmas \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udfff when my car got broken into by coyotes \ud83d\udc3a. As they say, no risk, no reward, but on the upside, no coyotes. \ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a\n\n*Thankfully, I gained something worth so much more than actual money: experience.* Experience is the nugget of wisdom. And now, I'm sharing these nuggets with you for free, because you can't put a price on something priceless or a worth on something worthless. \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\n\n**1. Do insider trading \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f-** Insider trading is when you trade inside like at your house or office. It's much more profitable and comfortable than outsider trading, which is when you trade living outside in a tent or your car. Right now I\u2019m in a Hyundai Santa Fe outside of Santa Fe, CA, by the I-5 exit next to Wendy\u2019s. No, I'm not sucking off outside of Wendy's! I tried that, and they called the police. \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f\n\n**2. Watch futures \ud83d\udd2e** - After markets close, traders monitor futures markets, or \"Futes,\" to see how the market will perform the next day. After market close, I monitor Monster, Craigslist and Indeed because I'm been concerned about my future since my employer fired me for gambling all day. \ud83d\udd2e\n\n**3.0 Don't under estimate the earth-shattering potential of Web 3.0 \ud83c\udf10-** I paid six figures of for coins, tokens and monkey pictures. These digital assets were worth thousands of dollars and now they're worth dozens of dollars. This is highly disruptive technology. \ud83c\udf3d has taken me to a totally new paradigm of personal finance: chapter 11 bankruptcy. \ud83c\udf10\n\n**4. No Regulation! \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f** Everyone alive should trade stocks, even babies! \ud83d\udc76 I'll go January 6th if the SEC tries to regulate this! I am personally emailing Hunter Biden a flacid dick pic every day and I encourage you to join me. Tell the government: TURN THE PRINTER BACK ON! I'M FUCKING DYING! \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\n\n**5. Play dead \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f-** The only way to win in a bear market is to curl up and play dead. My wife took the kids and I didn\u2019t put up a fight. **Don\u2019t KYS, but do fake your own death.** Skip town, start over, take on a new identity. One good FD is all it takes to buy a fake ID, SS and birth certificate. This is blackmarket advice. \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\n\nIn conclusion, I miss my wife. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc67\n\nTLDR:\n\ud83d\udca5\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udfae\ud83e\udeb5\ud83e\udddb\ud83d\udcbe\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffc\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83c\udfda\ufe0f\ud83c\udfda\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udd2e\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf3d\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc67",

What if I told you the value of the dollar is about to increase by about 50% \n\n[Right here we have about a 50 year wedge that did a fakeout in the 2000's to the downside then pumped and broke out in 2015 and has been concolidating a double bottom since which just broke out two months ago. The price target of the wedge would indicate about a 75&amp;#37; move up, which about 60&amp;#37; of which is left to happen.](https://preview.redd.it/1evhipxyl5791.png?width=1385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c27c94447ec2f4b85f8195b013ce0ada0ea011b0)\n\nThings to note is that above is a MONTHLY chart meaning these things take years so I estimate 1-2 years of pumping dollar which mean everything else will go down in value\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond up is gold, your average idiot believed gold is the way but gold is painting nasty patterns and has been on a decline since the year started\n\n[over here we can see the red mini double top spanning about 2 years, once that green line breaks itll fall and the PT is about 30&amp;#37; to that red channel, However, it is within a massive almost 12 year double top which has a PT that is about 70&amp;#37; down from here](https://preview.redd.it/cenhaf1in5791.png?width=1411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1df2a122e634eacd292dedcda64f2d478f39897f)\n\nAs for the markets everyone was seen the large time frame 2008 comparisons so Ill throw it in once more for fucks sake\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwcy780so5791.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50e9fa9c4d2fd8ed926c81f9b21fa0cbe24ee0b3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe UVXY has been getting coiled down and big money tried to ban it like 2 months ago because its \"risky\" which sounds like when they tried to ban GME. Its gonna go parabolic once this all starts to move\n\n[This is an asset that should be going to zero and constantly down over time however over the past year it has been sideways forming a reversal pattern on large consolidating volume. SO someone is hoarding this shit](https://preview.redd.it/5jjzqqcpp5791.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74832a2bc957ad684e444c90b2420ef486b0b090)\n\nNormally and historically UVXY flies about 1000% but I think this time will be much more because of this coiling. Yesterday on closure it moved significantly up with that small move we got from spy so the suppressing is done and it'll moon going forwards. \\* this is a chart another reddit user pointed out to me and I dont take credit for it so thank you u/anh423 \n\n[Oil is also in a double top on the larger frame, had a bullish fakeout and is now crumbling back down, has about 35&amp;#37; more to go](https://preview.redd.it/iowrtfeuq5791.png?width=1406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6748a42caa1a958edcbdf1b10fa2908ac18764d8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the smaller frames we just broke a bear flag on the nasdaq commencing the drilling\n\n[This is the small domino that will start the big moves, it all starts today](https://preview.redd.it/7050q8vap5791.png?width=1399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76454bd6baa8001b5bb3c6ef10dd574218985fd1)\n\nI will not cover fake internet coins because those are banned, current positions are 3 September $30 UVXY contracts because I had no money because of my gambling addiction and I am getting laid off in 3 weeks. I got those contracts last week and hasnt opened my portfolio since because I dont want to know how much I lost so far as seeing causes emotions which in turn puts dents in my diamond hands. Im hoping to make 1000-5000% on them then ill short the vix top with spreads ITM for an easy 300% or so which should  give me a sum i can survive on until finding another job (the uvxy play is not mine as stated above) The reason I also believe this dump will trigger UVXY is because everything will go down, stocks, crude, gold and heck even the all reliable trustworthy digital real estate will be hit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTDLR: everything is gonna go down and im getting fired in 3 weeks, not financial advise (obv) lol but yea 3 contracts in September, charts are all monthly so yes technically yearly leap contracts would\u2019ve been smarter and trying to time the market is retarded I know\n\nEdit: fuck you Powell\nEdit: nothing here is ADVICE, not financial, not astrology, definitely not relationship advice but I would still let my wife\u2019s boyfriend fuck her cuz he buys me Cheetos.",

    "selftext": "TLDR; Buy leveraged volatility products....MARKET CAPITULATION...Vix spikes before S&amp;P bottom.... hold gains in SVXY to make more money while waiting for S&amp;P bottom... Buy S&amp;P bottom and hold....shop for houses in gaped housing market....take back our property from the big banks\n\nEDIT: PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT UVXY DECAY. SOME OF YOU SOUND SO STUPID RN. Both volatility products I\u2019m invested in have been green since January. Volatility is coiling.\n\nAs inflation continues to compound and fuck us day after day, it can be easy to get beat down in the dumps. If you're like me, you are getting paid nothing at a job that you are gonna lose by the end of July, yet you still dump all of your measly pay stubs directly into the market like the degenerate gambler you are. Some may call it irresponsible, I call it making lemonade out of the most bitter of lemons.\n\n**The lemons:**\n\nWe all know a recession is coming. We all know inflation will not stop with these pathetic 75 bp hikes. We all know that the housing market will crash. We all know that the stock market will crash. The fun and games from 2021 are over. Historically, retail traders get absolutely fucked under these conditions, and at the end of the boom bust cycle, the rich get richer as they extract wealth from the retail bagholders. This will happen no more. While yes, food and gas are beginning to become unaffordable and it seems like the end is near, I like to stay glass half full. **I aim to turn this \"once in a lifetime\" market turmoil into an event of massive wealth creation, and you should too.** My plan has 4 main phases which I will list below.\n\n***THE LEMONADE:***\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation (UVXY)--** Currently, I am in phase one of my plan: **buying as many shares of leveraged volatility products as possible.** Since Jan 2022 we have seen much market volatility. Although the market has sold off 20%, there has not been a large move on the VIX. This is not concerning to me. It seems to be indictive of organized selling and exiting from institutions. This has given me time to buy UVIXY on the dips as they oscillate during the sell off. Looking at 2008 this same set up can be seen. VIX did not move much at all as the S&amp;P sold off 20%. It was not until the capitulation when VIX spiked. When will capitulation occur? I'm not sure, but I am damn sure that I will have all the capital I can spare in volatility products when the day comes. I will begin to sell when VIX cracks 50, but my price target is 60+ or possibly 70s.\n\n **Phase 2: Bridging the Gap (SVXY)--** So VIX pops off, now what? Well if you look at the graph below, VIX spikes 4 whole months before the S&amp;P bottoms. So the question is, what do I do with all my gains from the volatility squeeze? I can't just have them sitting around uninvested. Answer: SVXY. SVXY is a leveraged inverse VIX etf. As VIX drops from the 60s to the 30s I can make an over 50% return by buying and holding SVXY until the market finally bottoms. This will allow me to make money while I wait to buy the REAL dip \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Capitulation in 2008, VIX did not spike until well after an S&amp;P bear market. ](https://preview.redd.it/4d4saqp5if791.png?width=3781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddcb1e3dfa3aecfd55f9bb4085449603c1e75bb3)\n\n**Phase 3: Buying the REAL Dip (SPY)--** S&amp;P Price target? See burry tweet below. Once I buy SPY, I will finally be able to rest, as the previous steps will require extreme stress and paying more attention to the market than any autist should.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Barring a miracle, I will not consider buying the S&amp;P until it nears 2000. ](https://preview.redd.it/xglbiewaif791.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a12910d0f41a0d4944a6c243d8cfa9c5f3572d66)\n\n**Phase 4: Own Real Assets (Buy a House)--** Honestly getting tired of typing at this point. We all know that for each % increase in the federal funds rate, housing prices drop by like 10-20% or some bullshit. On top of this, the housing market moves much more slowly than the equities market, so I will have ample time to shop around after the slow inevitable decline of the housing market.\n\nI never thought owning a house would be in the cards for me (especially after I lost all my GME gains betting against Tesla). It's time for redemption of every bear who went short too early back in 2021. **It's time for us retail investors to weather this bust cycle and end up with MORE money than we started it with. LETS BUY BACK OUR HOUSES FROM THE BIG BANKS.**\n\n**-FreshJury**\n\n \n\n[ Positions or Ban. ](https://preview.redd.it/du2v49ijif791.png?width=2987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9aaec14f749cb78c4913fc828aece72b043523)",

    "title": "Could these be the reasons for today's rally in the Stock Market?",
    "selftext": "Respected Traders and Investors,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry guys. I know my long posts are \"Awol\" right now but i promise you they are coming and they are going to be really big. So brace yourselves whenever they hit this week or next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[June 15\\/16 bottom dilemma ?](https://preview.redd.it/py228ur0sl791.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab90ec9db4ac3319a23c764cc6431d86514c591a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for my previous long post you all know my stance. Post June 15 Fed meeting we rallied and we didn't predicted it this month. We predicted it since April when that March rally was kinda fading. But the following day we went down further on June 16 which shouldn't have happened because my levels are so high above that i just cannot be wrong. So i wrote that day the reason was the Swiss Bank surprise rate hike of 50 bps. Many new people who read the post thought hey this guy sounds condescending and thinks so highly of himself. Some just thought he is full of shit and needs approval of us. To be honest guys i am not that kind of person. I'm just a person who just lives in his mom basement because he thinks the world is coming to an end starting this q4 but before that a more stronger bear market rally than march is coming which will fuck those bears who thinks their puts are gonna print millions of dollars when market goes down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's discuss what could be the reasons of market pump today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo things have happened today \n\n\\- We got Michigan data came out which in my opinion wasn't that bad. Here look it yourselves guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Michigan Data](https://preview.redd.it/t5qn90fbtl791.jpg?width=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fff63476c216386e2182dee1ff626c227fbd5a98)\n\nThe key takeaways were the 5 year inflation expectations. It's coming down and also the 5 year break even on the technical charts are. Now these numbers could easily be cooked. Also the inflation expectations for June are low meaning when we see the June readings in July CPI it could go down significantly considering we will be measuring inflation with last yr June in July high CPI read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Now this what i'm about to tell you is very contradictory. Many people won't like the guy who told me this but hey he was right about Swiss Franc. It's called Geo-Political chart.  \n\n\n[Poland 10 year bonds vs Poland Stock Market](https://preview.redd.it/1qv526u8ul791.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7b137eabdd8008ea67b1d3866afffa08cb1a08)\n\nSo i heard it on news that just maybe the Russia-Ukraine conflict is over. Look at the 10 year bonds. ( Bonds rarely lie in comparison to stocks ) The green candle is kinda anomaly since the war rumor started ( Green line ) and you could also look at the point when the war really started. ( red line ) You can also observe the breakout in the relative strength index on weekly time frame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these in my opinion is working out quite nicely for us heading into next month data we will be focusing on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- July 13 CPI : Which should come lower as discussed above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- July 28 GDP : Positive we go up , Negative ahh i'm not really sure. Could be we have priced it in or could be we should fall because things are not looking good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- July 26-27 Fed meeting : Right now i don't wanna comment about this because i'm ashamed of what happened last time. I couldn't write the post about the changes JP Morgan did at last moment and had to tweet about it. Many people didn't read it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo guys like i always say keep enjoying and have a good time. The US economy doesn't look so good. Even the people in \"All in Podcast\"  ( Do watch the episode guys. It's GOAT finance podcast ) kinda agrees with me because of this data below. This situation if you do remember is kinda like the time of S&amp;P and Moody refusing to lower the credit ratings on mortgage bonds. ( Blind lady from Big short )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Once this goes down. Boooooom](https://preview.redd.it/aj36i7hdwl791.png?width=1796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5720b40e91a17dd4857a2ae49adead1ae3a0aefd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if you do remember guys i have been bullish on Chinese stocks like NIO ( up 40% since my $100 portfolio. Reason : George Soros ) and BABA ( up 20% ) since the start of my Wall Street letter series. If you want more proof here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$3.86 on May 27 went to $86.55. That's 22x this year. Kinda like GME 2022 for institutions. Full disclosure i bought stocks not this.](https://preview.redd.it/hg6hp8gixl791.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9343345523174838864ab890c2e0e52cf1cf2ed7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso don't forget guys i insider traded Roku shares with Cathie wood. They are up 30% right now. So please don't sell them. SEC can track you down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all i have to say for now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a fabulous evening after work guys. Maybe we cross paths on NYC bars.\n\nP.s. Someone needs to open a bar only for stock market people. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you\n\nRegards\n\nUchiha",

Maybe, maybe... \ud83d\ude4f**\n\nThis is what the chart looked like when we closed on Friday. Showing signs of double top on very low volume. Quite bearish, if you ask me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlu3229in1891.png?width=2650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4673e3993e483a740a9d4372087b3bce07a7b128\n\nAnd this is what the chart looks like 5 minutes ago:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vaoakd9nn1891.png?width=2652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e81d6116a1c3f0483a22184b8cfa0ff7f0cad13\n\nThis picture above is *even more* bearish. More confirmation of a major reversal coming, even if it's the 1 minute chart.\n\nWhen the prices were closing on Friday, the price action of all the stocks freaked me out. There were several anomalies that made me [exit all my AAPL call positions:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vjxutl/a_modest_3k_gain_in_3_days_from_11k_to_14k_this/)\n\n1. All stocks across the board exhibited consolidation, which is normally quite bullish, but not all stocks had the same pattern.\n2. The volume was too consistently high for a lot of them.\n3. There was actually too little volatility that day for my liking.\n\nPut those points together, and there is actually a good chance that players were getting out of the game and exiting, instead of accumulating.\n\nSo out of impulse, in addition to closing my my positions, I took a small risk and bought some 0DTE SPY puts 388 strike.\n\n[Also picked up some GME shares 'cause the price action was really weird. Started dropping fast waaay before any of the other stocks did, volume increased, looked like it stabilized, so decided to make a move to add to my DRS stack.](https://preview.redd.it/e0649f0ko1891.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61cea93535d07b6e7fe44c7692c063895714ce3c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, first hour of futures is looking quite good, for the bears. Wanted to put this post out there. I'm not sure how low the price can go, but below 380 EOD tomorrow is not out of the question, imo. Cheers guys, hope you make it \ud83e\udd42\n\n**Edit 1 (Update 7:47 EST):**\n\n[Triple top, high volume at the peaks, even more bearish confirmation.](https://preview.redd.it/oglfoqyvy1891.png?width=2650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5ec6b6b615dd6d673bcca90dbe603cf949c58c6)\n\n**Edit 2 (Update 8:05pm):**\n\n[Consolidating here, trying to make a lower low.

Low volume still, consider it consolidation at the lows, we should be going lower soon. Unless, of course, I'm completely wrong. I could be wrong if the price crosses that green line.

This is what a bear would want to see. If there were signs of a bull trap, these would be it. And IF it is a bull trap, this would make tomorrow all the more red.

I am expecting a drop some time between now and 8am EST. There could still be a random pump from here to the high last hour, but I am still bearish.

But if you want to know a secret, I am seeing hints of bearish divergence, both regular and hidden \\(if you know what that means\\).

We can see that it's starting to get volatile, in the downward direction. If it were volatile going up for that last candle, I would've said bullish short term.

This is it, there's no coming back. Based on previous price action, 1\\) high volatility after major pumps, 2\\) on low volume, 3\\) a more massive manipulated pump, 4\\) immediate downward volatility consolidating at low fib lines, 5\\) waterfall drop, the chance of us returning to make highs from here is extremely unlikely.

It should consolidate, sideways, and down from here.](https://preview.redd.it/geuzj7hko3891.png?width=2650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc51153b19b0f8d75df4897ccd06b8d71e9672ea)\n\n**Edit 14 (Update 2:40am):**\n\n[What did I tell ya, consolidation and down, sideways and down, ezpz.

This is usually a pretty bullish signal. However, the price action isn't volatile enough in the downward direction for me to believe it.

I am not here for upvotes, I just wonder if you guys could help me understand something and I will be on my way with thanks.\n\n2 weeks ago, my brother in law convinced his parents and a few other family members to buy gamestop shares, as many as they can afford. They listened: investing way more than they can afford to lose in GME.\n\nHis justification is that there will be a squeeze, which I don't understand. He says that some big firms will soon have to buy back shares but will not be able to find a buyer so the price will rise by several orders of magnitude.\n\nI don't get it. Could anyone shine some light on this? Is he right? This makes no sense to me, why would these firms have a problem buying these shares, if anyone can buy them? Forgive my abject ignorance.\n\nSecondly, I have seen the term bag holder, and I read its definitionin the FAQ as someone who bought shares at the top, presumably losing money. Why is this called bag holding?\n\nThank you chaps",

    "title": "Activist Short Selling - I analyzed the performance of the most famous activist short-sellers over the past 5 years. Here are the results!",
    "selftext": "Activist Short Selling is one of the most controversial topics in the stock market. I believe it\u2019s neither well understood nor commonly used by retail investors. There are arguments from both sides with some stating that [short-sellers manipulate the market](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/12/business/dealbook/are-activist-short-sellers-misunderstood.html) with their reports and should be reigned in by the S.E.C whereas others argue that [short-sellers are watchdogs](https://www.hec.edu/en/knowledge/articles/how-activist-short-sellers-police-financial-markets) that police the financial markets!\n\nWhile I have no expertise to comment on the legalities of short selling, what I can do is see if we can make money out of their recommendations! I have collected the recommendations/reports made by some of the biggest activist short-selling firms over the past 5 years. This would be the ultimate litmus test for short-sellers as barring 2022, it has predominantly been a bull run and 2020-2021 was the period when the [everything rally](https://www.ft.com/content/d785632d-d9a0-45ae-ae57-7b98bb2fb8d6) was going on!\n\nBut before we jump into the results, it\u2019s important to understand how short-selling works and how companies and investors make money out of it.\n\n### What is Short-Selling?\n\nTypically, most of us make money in the stock market in the form of capital gains and dividends. When we are bullish on a stock, we buy it in the hope that the stock price appreciates over the holding period.\n\nBut what if you are bearish about a stock? Maybe you don\u2019t like Facebook due to their lax privacy concerns or you think Tesla is overvalued for the number of cars they sell - What can you do in such a situation to make money?\n\nThe answer is short selling. It\u2019s the process of borrowing a security and then selling it in the market. You then purchase it later at a lower price thereby pocketing the difference as profit. An example would make this much clearer.\n\nLet\u2019s say Apple stock is trading at $100 per share and you expect its price to go down. You borrow 100 shares and then sell them for $10K *(At its current market value)*. 2 days later, they release an abysmal earnings report and the stock price crashes to $80. Now you purchase 100 shares at $80 for $8K and then replace the shares you borrowed thereby netting a cool $2k from the crash[1](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/short-selling#footnote-1).\n\nThe astute among you might have noticed a critical risk with this strategy \u2192 that your gains are limited but your losses are unlimited. The max profit that you can make in this trade is $10K *(if the stock goes to zero aka bankruptcy)* but the max loss can be unlimited. If the stock jumps to $200, you are down $10k (100% loss) and if the stock jumps to say $500, you are down $40k (300% loss). This is exactly how hedge funds shorting GameStop stock went [bankrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/06/22/london-based-hedge-fund-closes-after-betting-against-gamestop-becoming-one-of-first-meme-stock-casualties/) during the meme stock rallies.\n\nNow that we have an insight into how we can make money betting against stocks, let\u2019s look at some of the most popular activist short-sellers whose calls I have analyzed.\n\n### The Contenders\n\nWhile there are hundreds of companies and hedge funds that short stocks to make a profit, I am focusing only on the ones that make their reports public. If these companies do end up making a killing in the market, only public reports allow us to follow their recommendations. I have analyzed 4 activist short-sellers for this research.\n\n1. [Hindenburg Research](https://hindenburgresearch.com/) *(33 reports in the last 6 years)*: The most famous activist short seller on the market. These guys are the ones that released the reports on Nikola *(Which caused the stock to drop by 40% and the SEC to open an inquiry into Nikola)* and Clover Health.\n2. [J Capital Research](https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/index.html) *(26 reports in the last 5 years)*: Although they focus mainly on Chinese markets, they have issued short reports for multiple companies listed in the US as well. For all the controversies associated with short sellers, they were also one of the most transparent companies I came across - Below is the header taken directly from their homepage[2](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/short-selling#footnote-2).  \n*Be warned. We are activists, usually on the short side. We are biased. We do our best to find and present facts, based on extensive primary research and using public sources. \u200bBut we will profit if these stocks decline or, when we are long, rise in value.*\n3. [Muddy Waters Research](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/) *(12 reports in last 5 years)*: They produce reports on business, accounting, and fundamental frauds in companies. They also mainly focus on the Chinese market. The firm is best known for spotting fraud at [Sino-Forest Corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Forest_Corporation), a Canadian-listed Chinese company whose stock fell 74 percent before it eventually filed for bankruptcy.\n4. [The Bear Cave](https://thebearcave.substack.com/) *(31 reports in the last 2 years)*: This one is the most interesting one among the bunch. Bear Cave is exposing bad companies twice a month. What distinguishes Bear Cave from all the others *(Other than its accessibility to retail investors)* is that Edwin Dorsey, who issues these reports, does not take positions against the companies and instead makes money solely from paid subscriptions. I guess this allows him to be more objective in his reports.\n\n### Results\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqhaejs54d891.png?width=1131&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5d934a2478266f521bc0a1894c79b186e1dd372\n\nWould you look at that! Short-seller reports absolutely wreck the stock performance. In all the cases, the 1-year performance preceding the short report was stellar but after the reports, the companies significantly underperformed the benchmark.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the performance of [The Bear Cave](https://thebearcave.substack.com/). Edwin made 31 short reports over the past 3 years. On average, these stocks returned a whopping 297% in just one year preceding the report. But, after the reports were issued, the average return for the next year was only -0.5%. Also, these stocks fell 8.2% on average just one day after the short report was issued.\n\nAlso, from our research, we can see that short sellers are not there for short-term stock price manipulation. The average performance of these stocks after one month, one year, and to date[3](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/short-selling#footnote-3) are all negative and considerably lower than S&amp;P 500! This shows that in most of these reports, the short sellers showcase fundamental issues related to the businesses they are issuing the reports on.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s see some of the best calls made by short-seller firms. Hindenberg Research is famous for bringing down some really big companies such as Clover Health and Nikola. Their short report on Nikola was directly responsible for Trevor Milton resigning from his Executive Chairman position. They also issued a short report on Lordstown Motors which alleged that the company\u2019s 10,000 pre-orders were largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4nfxgv64d891.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5ec8d4d297d2fa821a973eb05225ba1e7da456c\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe results do look rosy for the short sellers but you should be aware of some of the limitations in the research\n\n* Companies that were listed outside the US and covered by the short sellers were not considered in this analysis. The overall performance can be considerably better as developing markets have much laxer reporting standards and short-sellers can be much more effective there.\n* Garbage In Garbage Out principle is applicable here \u2192 All the data collected for this research was from the respective company\u2019s official website.\n* The returns might not be proportional to the drop in stock price. Since a lot of people are expecting the stock price to drop following the short report, the [implied volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp#:~:text=Implied%20volatility%20is%20the%20market's,factors%20for%20calculating%20implied%20volatility.) of the put option will be high leading to high premiums.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, before you jump into shorting stocks based on the next short-seller reports, you should know that it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows in the shorting world. Even veteran investors have burned their hands shorting stocks. Famous investor Bill Ackman [lost as much as $750 Million](https://streetfins.com/bill-ackman-versus-herbalife-what-happened/#:~:text=Five%20years%20later%2C%20it%20seems,Million%20on%20the%20short%20position.) shorting Herbalife. Hedge funds have [lost more than $20 billion](https://infinityinvesting.com/gamestop-hedge-fund/) betting against Gamestop and [Melvin Capital](https://infinityinvesting.com/gamestop-hedge-fund/) had to shut shop following the GME rally.\n\nAll of this comes down to the fact that shorting stocks is fundamentally an extremely risky strategy with limited upside and unlimited downside. If you can stomach the risks, it\u2019s a great way to make a killing in the market.\n\nWhile I do think there are some issues with short-sellers as [highlighted by the GameStop](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-short-sellers-under-scrutiny) saga, I believe that they are instrumental in weeding out the bad players in the market. In a market full of optimists, it\u2019s good to have a small bunch of pessimists!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Data**: All the data used in the analysis can be found [**here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/short-seller-reports-6ESlWYa2cLVdITP8wMjIIZ/live)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I am simplifying the process way too much here. If you are planning to actually do this, do [read](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/ins-and-outs-short-selling) about the exact process and risks involved.\n\n\\[2\\]  Imagine having something similar in investing/trading platforms.\n\n\\[3\\] Till date is considered June 1st, 2022\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

    "title": "$ARK posted some strategies to github, one of which was Monte Carlo, which they used this to give $TSLA a $3,000 PT by 2026. Let's use Monte Carlo on $GME (Gamestop) to show why $ARK model makes no sense.",
    "selftext": "ARK thinks $TSLA is going to be a $3,000 stock in 2026. They've used Monte Carlo as one method to help them determine that price.   \n\n\n# Why that is stupid: \n\n This unconventional mathematical method is extremely powerful in the study of stochastic process. Here comes the argument on Linkedin. \"Stock price can be seemed as a [Wiener Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process). Hence, we can use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price.\" said a data science blog. Well, in order to be a Wiener Process, we have to assume the stock price is continuous in time. In reality, the market closes. The overnight volatility exists. But that is not the biggest issue here. The biggest issue is, can we really use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price, even a range or its direction?\n\nThe author offered a quite interesting idea. As he suggested, the first step was to run as many simulations as possible on [stochastic differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation#Use_in_probability_and_mathematical_finance) to predict stock price. The goal of simulations was to pick a best fitted curve (in translation, the smallest standard deviation) compared to the historical data. There might exist a hidden pattern in the historical log return. The best fitted curve had the potential to replicate the hidden pattern and reflect it in the future forecast. The idea sounds neat, doesn't it?   \n\n\nInspired by his idea, we can build up the simulation accordingly. To fully unlock the potential of Monte Carlo simulation, the ticker we pick is $GME (Gamestop), one of the best performing stocks.  \n\n\nIf we used Monte Carlo on $GME (From January 2019, to May 2022) we would think the stock price would be roughly what it was in the beginning of 2019.....Whereas in actuality the black line shows what the stock did.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monte Carlo on $GME](https://preview.redd.it/l9chc3tfek891.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494e12bdbbada29f1aac45a18244978dbbae9796)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's look at $TSLA. If we are to use Monte Carlo on $TSLA we would think the stock price is just shy of $1500 today...when in reality it's $676.59 at the time of this writing...it's more than 50% off.   \n\n\nCathy is most likley going to have a PT that is well over 2x what $TSLA will actually be in 2026 using stupid stuff like this, potentially 3x too high.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monte Carlo on $TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/0aou7drvek891.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da91080070d8a82cbd7e27ed93efe1a0ad3107c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nUsing Monte Carlo in stonks is stupid.",

    "selftext": "TL/DR: the ultimate FD\n\nSo first, for those of you who don't know, Pascal was a French mathematician, philosopher and Catholic theologian from the 17th century. The most famous piece of literature he wrote was his own thoughts and he invented one of the first calculators which he called the \"Pascaline\" (which somehow sounds like a waifu name). Basically, a very humble individual, but still a big name in religions and philosophical history, and the reason I believe most people on this sub are christian at heart.\n\nSo before you start stoning me at the pyre of atheism, hear me out: have you heard of Pascal's gambit?\n\nBasically, here are the stakes:\nOn one hand, your life now, on the other, eternal afterlife.\nEither you live a boring and righteous life now and hope for an eternity of party and doing coke off stripper's tits after death.\nOr you live your absolute best life now, and hope that hell doesn't exist.\n\nThe only problem is, you have no fucking idea what the odds are.\n\nSounds familiar? That's right, there is a 100% chance this guy would be buying far OTM 0DTE calls for infinite return when the stonk inevitably moons because he hoped seriously for it.\n\nI bet you all know the memes about the GME autists acting like jeovah's witnesses? Well I bet you never knew the lore ran so deep did you?\n\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

    "selftext": "[The face of evil](https://ibb.co/Kr0Qn6q)\n\n&gt;\u201dApes are poor and stupid\u201d -Stefan Semanov\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nSemanov studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the Russian School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander. In 1976 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.\n\n**Financial career**\n\nIn 1983 Semanov established the Semanov Fund (later Quantos Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987\u2014but wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.\n\nSemanov\u2019s status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Semanov had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. \n\nAfterward Semanov bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound\u2019s fall, but the scale of Semanov\u2019s operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of Russia.\u201d In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him\u2014at least temporarily\u2014as he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February.\n\n**CURRENT:**\n\nLatest 13F filings show that Semanov has taken a rather large short position against $GME, to the sum of **$100,000,000**, of which he is currently up $50m.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all - he has many ties to BCG, and has made the bulk of his fortune shorting companies into bankruptcy (Radioshack, Toys R Us, Blockbuster are the three most noteworthy) and his portfolio now has both GME and BBBY shorts, aswell as some defense stocks (BA, RTX, RBLX.)\n\nStefan Semanov has made **far more profit** shorting $GME than Citadel. Stefan Semanov is an evil man.\n\n#TL;DR Stefan Semanov is an evil man who is up $50m on $GME shorts\n\nEdit: Shills in the comments are trying to convince you this isn\u2019t Stefan Semanov. It is, the rich and powerful don\u2019t like being brought into the light like this.\n\nShill army is working overtime. Post your shorts, shills.\n\n[Downvotes won\u2019t make stickied posts go away, shills.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=48H34ukFe8g&amp;feature=emb_logo)",

    "selftext": "**Does it surprise you that it's technically possible for a $1 purchase of an asset to shoot the market cap up by millions of dollars, or for a $100 Million purchase to not move the price by a single penny? Let me explain.**\n\n**Intro:**\n\nA lot of people seem to have misconceptions like thinking if x dollars flow into an asset, its market cap will go up by x dollars. In fact, it is not possible to determine how much money has been put in to an asset based on its market cap, or conversely how much a market cap will move when some amount of money flows into or out of the asset.\n\nPrice is simply a function of the current state of the order books across all markets that list the asset.\n\nConsider this: let's say the current price of GME on NYSE is $125. What does that really mean? It simply means that the very cheapest limit sell order currently on their order books is for $125. That's what price means by definitional, right? Price is just the amount you have to pay to buy something, so on a exchange price is always simply the current cheapest limit sell.\n\n**Example 1: Huge Purchase with No Effect on Market Cap**\n\nLet's say that the current price of GME on NYSE is $125, and the person currently willing to sell at $125(and who is thus the person currently defining the NYSE price of GME)is a whale who is offering 10.000 GME at $125. Let's say I am a whale buyer and I am put in a market order for 9999 GME. Well, I will end up buying all 9999 from the whale seller, leaving them with 1 GME still for sale at $125. Since they are still selling 1 GME at $125, the price of GME on the NYSE is still $125. So I just bought nearly $1.25 million worth of GME but the price (and therefore the market cap) didn't move by even a penny.\n\n**Example 2: Tiny Purchase with Huge Impact on Market Cap**\n\nNow imagine another scenario. The current price of GME on NYSE is $125, because the current cheapest limit sell is someone selling 1 GME at the price of $125. Let's say I decide to buy 2 GME. Well, half of that will come from the person selling 1 at $125, which means I will consume that seller. The price of GME on NSYE will now teleport to whatever the next cheapest limit order is for (this is the mechanism by which price goes up when people buy). If GME is very high in liquidity (which means lots of limit orders on the books packed densely across the price spectrum), the next cheapest limit sell after the 1 GME at $125 would probably be at like $125,01. But if the liquidity is low for the sake of the example, let's imagine a more extreme scenario in which GMEC liquidity is extremely low so the next cheapest offer after the 1 GME at $125 is at 126,5 fully 1% more expensive. Ok, well, I end up getting 1 GME at $125, and another 1 GME at 126,5 fulfilling my market order and leaving the price of GME on NYSE $126,5. So, I have spent about $252,50. but I moved the price of GME by 1%, which means my purchase of $252,50 increased the GME market cap by nearly $ 95 million.\n\n**Closing Thoughts**  \nThere you have it, that is how prices actually move. It's not possible to know how much a given buy or sell will move a market cap unless you know the exact state of the order books at that moment on the exchange you're selling on, as well as the amount of arbitrage friction between all markets.",

    "title": "AMC first impressions",
    "selftext": "Hello WSB,\n\nFor the last week, I've spent some time on $GME and $AMC. I have some first impressions, which I thought I'd share. I should point out that my views are limited by the amount of time I've spent on the companies, which is about 15 hours for AMC and 5 hours for GME. I generally recommend at least 100, and more preferably, 500 hours of research on a stock before initiating a position.\n\nThe TLDR is that both stocks are approximately fairly valued. Most stocks (90% IMO) are fairly valued by the market. The market is quite efficient. If you find yourself unearthing great opportunities every time you look at a stock, you're doing it wrong. Very cheap (or very expensive) stocks only appear rarely, and those opportunities don't last long. In hindsight, it is easy to say \"well TSLA was really undervalued for a while.\" Sure. But the risk-adjusted investment thesis wasn't obvious at that time.\n\nTo me, AMC is funny because neither the bulls, nor the bears are exactly right. The bears are missing the obvious: this was a fairly profitable company with an actually decent business model that will return to its former self. Sure, the financials right now are really ugly, but they have weathered the worst of it and have been able to refinance their very expensive paper. With the \"apes\" in town, AMC should have literally no problem accessing cheaper money. So the stock isn't going to 2: sorry, shorts. I will be sharing models &amp; notes at some point soon.\n\nThe bulls also have it wrong, though. The value of the company is limited by the somewhat small and competitive space of box office. US Box office is only so big and AMC's share can only be so big before our favorite useless US government agency squawks about monopoly. So admission revenue can only ever really be 3-4B. Admissions margins aren't that bad, nor is the food &amp; beverage that comes with. The base business is fairly easy to value, and as I mentioned, near-sighted bears forget this simple fact. $800m in EBITDA in 2018 is fairly juicy if we can return to that. I think we will. But, Aron does not strike me as an incredible CEO who can transform or extend the business. The Hycroft deal, in my eyes, is embarrassing and will not result in value creation. The other expansion plans are more reasonable but still risky. If you think Aron can pull off multiple expansions into adjacencies flawlessly, you will be rewarded. If you model a normal probability of success &amp; risk in those efforts, you get fair value. There is no free lunch here.\n\nThe other thing that bears miss is short sellers are not some value creation tool. While some short-term hijinks may very well exist, they do not really impact price. Why not? Price discovery includes long sellers, which dwarf short sellers. Put the bullshit of \"synthetic shares\" and other non-existent creations out of your mind. Is this a stock you want to buy because you are getting it for less than the price a normal buyer (say Warren Buffet, KKR, etc.) would pay for company in an auction? That's all that matters. To me, the answer to this question, is that if an auction to buy AMC were held today, buyers would pay the approximate market price.\n\nRough price target: $11 based on 7% discount rate as revenues return to 5B, growing to \\~$7B towards the end of the decade. I'm assuming the company returns to prior peak EBITDA. It's possible there is slight upside to this and I will provide updates soon, but I don't see $20 or anything as even possible unless Aron pulls off several tricky execution milestones.\n\nThis is Shkreli. You already.",

    "title": "\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Guide To The Galaxy Vol. 1: $Hood",
    "selftext": "What's up fucknuts, welcome to my new series where we highlight the living dumpster fires that you can potentially make money off. For the first volume I feel like taking a layup and highlighting something near and dear to pretty much everyones heart here. Even down 75% from all time highs it is overvalued to the tits. Put a pin over your nose, some goggles and let us dive head first into the sewer shit. \n\n**The Business:**\n\nContrary to most beliefs around here, stocks actually represent an underlying business. Let me tell you holy crap I got to give Vlad credit for creating a zombie debt company from the ground up that I personally believe doesn't actually try to make money and has zero competitive advantage now. Robinhood has yet to ever make a single dollar of profit, only sucking the sweet sweet milk of ZIRP circa 2015. Literally they had the biggest tailwind in history, the government literally locked everyone in their house, gave them free money, and played the market like a video game.  Even then, Robinhood couldn't even squeeze out an ounce of profit. Side note, I find it absolutely hilarious that on IPO Robinhood only released its balance sheet dating back to 2019, I would kill to see some off those early numbers. Well, now the tide is starting to go out on this QE fueled retard bull market that so many screeched new world order. Stopping the carnage at March 31st 2022 lets see some napkin statistics of Robinhoods operations: \n\n* **Total net revenues** decreased 43% to $299\u00a0million, compared with $522\u00a0million in the first quarter of 2021.\n* **Transaction-based revenues** decreased 48% to $218 million, compared with $420\u00a0million in the first quarter of 2021. \n   * Options decreased 36% to $127\u00a0million, compared with $198\u00a0million in the first quarter of 2021.\n   * Cryptocurrencies decreased 39% to $54\u00a0million, compared to $88\u00a0million in the first quarter of 2021.\n   * Equities decreased 73% to $36\u00a0million, compared with $133\u00a0million in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nNeeds no explanation, literally a money furnace. \n\n**Competitive Advantage:**\n\nThis is one of the few concessions I'll grant Robinhood, early on it really shook up the brokerage market. I still remember having to pay 7 bucks commission on a trade, offering commission free trading was pretty revolutionary, however this is not an advantage for long because now almost every brokerage offers this same service. Comparable to the first pizza joints that offered delivery for their pizza, worked awesome for about 6 months then the competition caught on and soon enough everyone was doing it. \n\nNow onto my favorite argument from retards defending Robinhood: \"But The Ui Is sO GOoD\". Holy Jesus, Mother, and Mary imagine defending a business that fucked your ass because it has nice pavlovian colors and confetti when you lose money. Much how other brokerages were able immediately replicate commission free trading, you bet they have invested significant sums in updating their UI to drag in retards.\n\nCryptards will say that it enables them to \"invest\" in that stupid shit, but as history has recently shown that is the modern day version of snake oil. \n\n**Customer Service(Or Lack There Of):**\n\nThis is arguably the most important arm of any self respecting brokerage. If people are deciding to entrust their own money with your company, you better believe that they will want the ability to contact a person 24 hours a day in case something goes wrong with the myriad of possibilities. To this Robinhood said: best I can do is a robot or a voicemail. Imagine trying to sell some securities but being blocked, and when you try to call the company it sends you to voicemail, on god this is retarded even typing. This inefficiency literally drove somebody to fucking commit suicide and waste their entire future because of a mistake on robinhoods part. Long story short, 20 year old Alex Kearns woke up to a 730k negative deficit in his account that wasn't reconciled correctly, after trying to contact Robinhood to no avail he offed himself thinking his life was over. \n\n**The Clientele:**\n\nLets be honest, we all know that most of the people that actively use Robinhood are not the most financially savvy to begin with. Coupled with an average account size of only 4,000 smackers, the number itself doesn't breed entrenched investment through thick and thin. Compared to other brokerages it is laughable. For example, E-Trade is average 127k account and Schwab 234k. \n\n**Regulation and  Controversy:**\n\nNow for everybody's favorite part especially you apes salivating in the back. Everyone knows the story so I'll be quick about it and get to the current ripples. Robinhood actually butt fucked its customers to save its own skin, not to mention the greasy last minute concessions by the DTCC. However, Vlad failed to realize that he is rich, but not connected rich. What do I mean by this? During the GME debacle, when brought in front of government testimony. Vlad straight up lied to the government and wasn't even good at keeping his stories straight between interviews. As opposed to Ken Griffin who was literally obviously reading lies of a teleprompter, favorite memory of that is he was questioned about it during the hearing and had to admit he had 6 other people in the room with him while giving testimony. Like chum in the water, Vlad and Robinhood were thrown to the wolves as a scapegoat for the whole debacle. Since then, the committee released a report verifying that Vlad was indeed lying in his testimony and problems were much worse then made out to be. Rule number 1: don't lie to the government and make them look like jackasses, they'll roast you on a spit. We'll see if this turns out to be something, I think once this bear market fully capitulates we'll see real action by the government to shift blame onto Robinhood instead of itself. \n\n**FTX and Robinhoods Fake Saving Grace:**\n\nLike watching a South Park special that only gets more and more ridiculous. Truly Robinhoods only saving grace is to get acquired by a bigger firm similar to what happened in 2008 with Merrill but on different terms. But instead of getting absorbed, it is like an LBO drama out of the 1980s, where a company is using massive amounts of leverage to buy an already unprofitable piece of crap. Everyone is heralding the Bankman-Fried fuck cause his cryptard platform platform is bailing idiots out. But what if I told you that he's the biggest sucker of them all for doubling down on douchey investments? What fucking idiot would want to buy equities on a cryptard exchange?\n\nOn a personal note, I actually have a cousin that works for FTX and literally every new development with his job is greasy as hell. First his office was located in Taiwan but kept getting threats from China and cyber attacks. Then, they packed it up and moved the office to Jamaica to avoid U.S. regulatory controls. Moreover, being the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b that I am I always kind of attacked him with questions on validity of teeeether and its backing, specifically its commercial paper related to china. This back and forth ended with a comment that it seared in my brain: \"why does there need to be an audit if prices continue going up\".  \n\nIf Robinhood gets attached to the FTX charade before the final bang it will only attach a bowling bowl to its neck on the way down to rock bottom.\n\nTLDR: [Grease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7FsAgPuVwU)\n\nPositions:\n\nSitting on some Jan 2023 20,10, and 5 strike puts acquired in Aug-Oct 2021. In retrospect, I made this position pretty paltry and wish I would have committed more forces in hindsight, but that's just the way of the road bubs. Currently, only problem is that the market has pretty much waken up to the dumpster fire and premiums are pretty insane and the reward for the risk is pretty low. Nonetheless, still considering just taking a regular short position on a bear market rally.",

There's no more squeeze to be squoze. Large funds fuck with the price to get retail investors to throw more money in before taking it even lower. It's a game to them. That's why the meme stocks all move together for the most part, because these funds have figured out how to profit off of the gambler's complex (not that hard).\n\nLook at Gamestop objectively as just a business. Consider whether this is a business that will do well in the future (NFTs??!?!?). Malls are dying, and Gamestops are dying with them. RC is trying to transform the company, but it's not even close to there yet. I'm staying away until I see more clarity on a path forward that I can buy into (not NFTs).\n\nPositions: Nothing for GME, but I do have a few hundred AMC puts.",

Sure enough:\n\n[This is not good.](https://preview.redd.it/d58q0nphd6a91.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43be70039105105c873bf5979a65852900df9660)\n\nSo not only can we establish that there is an issue with how JPow feels, and he has a bearish outlook of the market, no. We can also extrapolate to what would happen if he did not use his house (The Fed) to act.\n\n**We all had a taste of what pushing the brakes meant:**\n\n[2022 Escalated Quickly](https://preview.redd.it/mjibntv8b6a91.png?width=1736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfce2aef0987d909da0727f396f53a83eb5a7b28)\n\n**Labia Hypercompressialis** Is the medical term for what would happen if this went on unchecked. While we cannot be sure, it would probably look something like this:\n\n[This is JPows endgame if we don't correct course soon. ](https://preview.redd.it/92akgrldb6a91.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35edcda38c534b43d5eefcdbe0003488d777f7d4)\n\nSo psychologically we have arrived at maximum tension. If you are up for it, take advice from the permabears that come out of hibernation to preach about the crash. Because it is clear, we are levered to the tits, once again.\n\n[This is america](https://preview.redd.it/b0msrym2f6a91.png?width=2426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=094cab20445b364203876a226d86e48cb1adfa3f)\n\nWhich puts JPow at the crossroads, helping the economy (QT) or the markets (QE5). Both will have to suffer a bit, but one more than the other for sure. The fate of the remains of your little tech portfolio depends greatly on how this all plays out.\n\nBecause remember, initially we just overshot with inflation by a little bit, so technically nothing bad should have happened. But whatever the Fed does, it has to be BIG. So we ended up at a point of relative saturation of both markets AND the economy. .\n\n[Crossroads](https://preview.redd.it/cgrdg0wqb6a91.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9ef0b1a6d9a860fcf82b637c26ef1f4a62fbc83)\n\nSo with the relative hangover, killing the economy is somewhat priced in. The question is, will we start pleasing the markets again?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87k79u4ub6a91.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da0f3b0f2a8405066587cbdfbc2d281b748d763\n\nTough times to be on the helm of the fed.

If there is one learning from this whole rambling it is\n\n**They are trying to make you feel hopeless** so that you sell your portfolio and they take all your money. After that, the bulls will be unleashed once more. **They will laugh at you.** They will buy Yachts and shit with your money.\n\n**DO NOT FUCKING SELL**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lwgmo62c6a91.png?width=1416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5248bb1499543337820448b1a44029c2ce091b5a\n\nJ**ust hold on to your positions and don\u2019t sweat it.

    "selftext": "  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8zxmh2j96a91.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5053f11c55860727fc7dba5856d5be4e2bc9627\n\nThis is a simplified version of what has been talked about nonstop for the last 24 hours. **Everyone has their opinions, and like assholes, I would love to hear yours!**\n\nThe gist of it is that short interest is possibly well over 100% because of darkpool trading which enables some hedge funds to naked short. From Investopedia, *naked shorting refers to* ***short pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the market***\\*. Despite being made illegal after the 2008\u201309 financial crisis, naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems.\\*\n\nSimplified, naked shorting drives a price down when the shorts are layered on, and need to be covered at some point with real purchases of shares. It allows short interest to exceed 100% of the float, or available shares on the open market. These are made possible by some market makers who work directly with the hedgies. What is hilarious is that these hedgies are thinking this is a good idea when the market makers are often the ones taking the other side, meaning they are long, which is always good for $GME investors because market makers aren't in the business of losing money.\n\nIf the stock is delivered as a typical stock split, dark pool shorts would be unaffected. But if it is delivered as a dividend, this creates a bit of a dilemma for naked shorts, whose stock will not be converted in this 4-for-1 fashion. They will then have to buy 3 shares on the open market for every one they originally owned, driving the price up significantly.\n\nThis is all theory and who knows what will happen. But if it did, it would be hilarious! Also this analysis sucks so point out issues and know that OP appreciates you. I basically read a bunch of strings and tried to make it as easy as possible to follow along.\n\n**TL;DR: Until July 21 you're going to deal with $GME theoretical posts. OP tried to make something helpful and succeeded at failing.**",

GameStop has announced that its board has declared to perform a four-for-one stock split.\n\nGameStop announced yesterday that it would soon be performing a four-for-one stock split. In the news release, the company provides specific details surrounding the stock split. \u201cCompany stockholders of record at the close of business on July 18, 2022 will receive a dividend of three additional shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock for each then-held share of Class A common stock. The stock dividend will be distributed after the close of trading on July 21, 2022. Trading will begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on July 22, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhen markets closed yesterday, GameStop (GME) stock was valued at $117.41. Following the news of the upcoming stock split, the stock climbed as high as $125.45 in after hours trading. The stock dividend will lead to a decreased price in the stock, causing investors to flock to it. GameStop is just the latest company to announce a stock split. A couple months ago, Nintendo announced that it would be doing a ten-for-one stock split. GameStop\u2019s split was approved by shareholders during the company\u2019s annual meeting in June.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the upcoming stock split has on GameStop (GME) and its stock, both short-term and long-term. Specifically, we\u2019ll be watching closely when the company reports its latest round of quarterly earnings in September.\n\nSource: [https://www.shacknews.com/article/131241/gamestop-gme-stock-split](https://www.shacknews.com/article/131241/gamestop-gme-stock-split)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzlh31fbp4a91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b567c630f13fb9fb277a340004827dcaefed696\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**GameStop (GME) is up 9.37% pre-market today.

    "title": "Cutting through the GME stock dividend hype",
    "selftext": "It only took a matter of minutes after the announcement for walls of text to start spamming all relevant subreddits with misinformation about the stock dividend.\n\nIt only takes a few minutes of reading through investopedia to understand how it actually works. But since I know most of you struggle with reading, and comprehension in general, I'll try to point out the important points...\n\n[What is a stock dividend?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp)\n\nA stock dividend is a dividend payment to shareholders that is made in shares. The pool of available shares in the company increases, diluting the value of existing shares.\n\nSo, in GMEs case, they are issuing and delivering 3 new shares for each share owned to share holders of record as of 7/18, while the share price simultaneously gets divided by 4 to balance everything out to even value.\n\nSo, what's the difference between a stock split, and a stock dividend, really? \n\nShort answer: Almost nothing. It may have some tax implications, and some accounting differences in the corporate books, but otherwise it's almost exactly the same. The share count is diluted proportionally to the decrease in price. All positions are adjusted accordingly, to exactly equal total value.\n\nWhere does the money come from to pay the stock dividend?\n\nShort answer: Nowhere. It's basically an accounting maneuver that slides money from one column on the corporate balance sheet to another column. Holders of short positions do not pay stock dividends.\n\nMore specifically, the money gets subtracted from the [Retained Earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp) account, which is just the corporate piggy bank containing all unspent profits, and moves it over to the [Paid-in Capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paidincapital.asp) account, which is the money given to a company from investors. Both contain available cash for the company to spend, and this move does not affect the value of the company, the value of anyone's held positions, or the value of available shares. It all adjusts proportionally to the split.\n\n.....\n\n\nTLDR; Shorts do not have to pay a dividend, or scramble to find extra shares. They'll owe back 4 times the number shares to close, while simultaneously 4 times the number of shares exist at 1/4 the price for each. It all balances out.\n\nThe stock dividend itself will not cause any kind of pressure to push the price up. It's very similar to a standard stock split. If the price does go up due to this, it will be on pure hype and misinformation.\n\nNo positions in this particular shit show.",

    "title": "PSA: GME stock dividend will not force shorts to cover",
    "selftext": "A stock dividend is treated differently than a cash dividend. When a cash dividend is paid on a stock, anyone who has a short position against those shares has to pay that dividend back to the holder they borrowed it from. This is because a cash dividend is real economic value that the lemder is entitled to.\n\nA stock dividend, however, does not require the shorts to do anything because it doesn't represent missed economic value from the lender's perspective. If I lent you one share of GME representing 1% equity ownership and it does a 4:1 stock dividend, you now owe me four shares conveying 0.25% ownership each. There's no economic value being accrued to the shares the lender owns, so there's nothing the short seller has to pay to make them whole. The short seller does not have to return the share to the lender then re-borrow the four shares. \n\n**Here's the most analogous example I could come up with**\n\nPretend you're renting a four-room house (represnting GME pre-stock dividend) from a landlord (representing the lender of the shorted shares). you only rented this house because you believe it will decline in value. Once your lease started, you secretly sold the house to some sucker who buys it because he wants to live there and is confident that the housing market is artificially depressed by fake houses listed on zillow in the area. He also heard rumors about a new law coming into effect soon which will expose this fraud. You're secretly planning to buy it back once the market value plummets, then terminate your lease. This isn't meant to be realistic so please don't nitpick at things like home ownership titles.\n\nCash dividend:  the landlord has a magical marijuana plant which requires no care yet yields exactly one ounce of mid-grade weed every quarter like clockwork. As a tenant, it's your contracted responsibility to mail him this weed every quarter. Once you sell the house, the new homeowner is legally entitled to the quarterly ounce of weed from this plant, so you cant mail your landlord his weed anymore. Instead, you buy identical mid-grade weed every quarter from a dealer and send that to him. Landlord is happy to be receiving the mid-grade weed he's entitled to, and can't tell the difference bc shitty mids is shitty mids.\n\nStock dividend: a pointless new law is announced: all four rooms within this house now have a different address, and represent four distinct properties. As a result, your lease is changed to four separate leases, each at 1/4 the monthly rent. Your total monthly rent hasn't changed, and your landlord's house hasn't either. In other words, your monthly rent has not changed, and you don't owe your landlord anything. You don't have to move out of his house at 11:59 pm on the last day of your old lease and then move back in 2 mins later when the new 4-room lease kicks in.\n\n**TLDR and TDDU (too dumb don't understand)** - If that's still too complicated for you apes. The dildo I use on your wife breaks down into four stackable pieces of increasing girths, like those Russian matreyshka dolls. If I lend you that dildo and It comes apart while you're thrusting it into your dumb ass and can't figure out how to put it back together, you now owe me the four pieces of my dildo that add up to the whole dildo I lent you. That's it. You don't have to return the 4 shit covered dildo components to me then re-borrow them.\n\nI look forward to seeing where the next goalpost is placed.",

Babe Ruth's [Curse of Bambino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino) kept the RedSox from winning the championship for 80+ years. And now we have the Curse of GME Stonk - If you bet against GME during the meme stock phase, you got trouble. Here is rundown of what has happened to the key players so far:\n-- Gabe Plotkin, Melvin Capital. He shutdown the fund after suffering $billions in losses. He is looking for a job rn. Dude also has a stake in the Charlotte Hornets. Enough said.\n-- Andrew Left, Citron research. He lost 100% of his GME short position and has since [stopped publishing short reports](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qbfn5tftymfw/Amid-the-GameStop-Frenzy-Andrew-Left-Calls-It-Quits-On-Short-Reports-After-20-Years)\nOh and [his house was raided by the feds earlier this year](https://www.shacknews.com/article/128692/tsla-gme-short-andrew-left-of-citron-research-had-his-computers-seized-by-the-fbi-last-year)\n-- Robinhood - Stock is down 80% and even a FTX Billionaire Bro declined to buy 'em\n-- Vlad Tenev - Net worth down 90% and dude has been investigated by Feds and Congress. \n-- Citadel &amp; Ken Griffin - Last seen digging himself into a [deeper hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uzbkk8/after_robinhood_melvin_capital_now_ken_griffin_jr/)\n\nMeanwhile in memeland: GME stock has stabilized, is doing a stock split and the company is moving aggressively with its growth plans.

    "title": "$GME Technical Setup - PRIMED For A Huge Move",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR - GME form nicest big setup in a long time, wait for daily close over 144.00 to target 200, 250, 300 to be safe. Play weekly close over 128.00 if you are degen.**\n\n\\---\n\nIt's not often you see $GME form setups like this, so I figured I would share. You might find my point of view interesting since I am not a holder and I only swing the stock on a short-term basis, which gives me a rather unbiased viewpoint.\n\nSome of you might remember me from the last few rallies. Pretty much before every single large GME move to the upside, it forms setups similar to this. The other memey stocks do the same thing, almost like they are all correlated and binded to a sector of their own making. Anyway, let's get to the point.\n\nThe price action the past few weeks is particularly interesting because instead of just dumping after a huge green candle, we are instead maintaining a higher range and consolidating sideways, gathering energy for bullish continuation. This doesn't happen often with $GME.\n\nStarting with the 3Y 1W chart:\n\n[$GME 3Y 1W](https://preview.redd.it/5be78jq02sa91.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c757ea026c6d1bc20ed8de2cc7e2ac5d1c4b6f03)\n\nThis is a massive falling wedge (the setup I mentioned that we form before pretty much every move to the upside).\n\nThe breakout point is at 128.00 - we closed a literal nut hair above it last week. I don't like close calls, I much prefer sure things in trading, so I did not act on this quite yet. I'd like to see another week over to confirm it.\n\nRegardless, this is the largest setup of this nature GME has ever formed, with three solid reactions to the upper trendline. A confirmed breakout would target 200.00, 250.00, 300.00 as logical price targets. I know you guys want to hear GME to infinity, but I'm just being as unbiased as possible.\n\nMoving onto the 1Y 1D chart, which is another reason I have not entered yet:\n\n[$GME 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/pgumvgky2sa91.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3831d89d5107561f919210a87c9a02c7d41d1cfa)\n\nThis is the interesting price action I was talking about from the past few weeks. After that huge rally Mid-May, rather than dumping, we are flagging out and forming another falling wedge - right on the larger one's breakout point. This is an ideal scenario, and healthy for an eventual break to the upside.\n\nTo be safe, rather than playing the red line, you could play the purple one, waiting for a daily close over 144.25 to enter, and looking for the same targets.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is this teal line that has confluence with key resistance @ 162.50. This could yield a strong rejection and ruin a breakout, so keep a close eye on it.\n\n**Keep in mind - this purple falling wedge is a downtrend until it breaks. This is another reason I am waiting for us to break it. We could chop down and reject a while longer before clearing it.**\n\n**Also keep in mind, it's invalidated and no longer in play if we close a day under 112.65 - this is the bear scenario and could yield a violent breakdown to 78.00 and lower.**\n\nLastly, I'm looking to play STOCK with this setup. GME options are jacked to the tits with IV and have really shitty risk/reward.\n\n\\---\n\nThis is by far the most interesting setup I have seen in the stock since the initial squeeze, but keep in mind it is not a sure thing. Technical analysis is an assessment of probabilities, rather than \"this **WILL** happen\". \n\nIt doesn't really matter for a retard, since stop losses and stuff are mythical creatures to you all, but just something to keep in mind before you lose your shit if it doesn't go up 1000% tomorrow.",

    "selftext": "$LMND reminds me of Amazon $AMZN in their early days  \n\n$LMND reminds me of Amazon $AMZN in their early days. Keeping Shorty Shadow aside Lemonade is disrupting a Trillion Dollar Market. Global Insurance is huge over one trillion for just AUTO INSURANCE. The problem or market has been solved by the same old legacy insurance providers like GEICO, State Farm, All State, Liberty Mutual on and on. These legacy providers have milked a market with little change for centuries which provides Lemonade $LMND the opportunity to disrupt at lightening speed with a digital platform AI, Machine Learnings that allows them to acquire new customers at 1/10th the cost of legacy providers. This same digital platform also allows $LMND to manage losses more efficiently thus delivering greater customer satisfaction. Let face it the dumb commercials on TV do nothing. This is what happens when you have no real difference in your offering. You run dumb TV commercials like that gecko of GEICO but what insurance customers really want is great service, great pricing (we all hate to pay for insurance PERIOD) and great claim management. Lemonade $LMND delivers on this entire package plus the share price has been suppressed thanks to powerful short sellers, Hedge Funds like those that muscle Game Stop $GME (Steve Cohen, Point72 or Ken Griffith Citadel or Melvin Capital). Shorty will be squeezed like a LEMON. \n\nFurther Mr. Market has not factor in the power of bundle insurance solutions. Metromile $MILE is about to be absorbed at a very efficient price and this will allow $LMND to deliver a bundled insurance offering that will rival any insurance company.

    "selftext": "Say u bought some digital version of a game, say on PC (steam,etc.) or ps4/5, xbox, wii, etc. and u want to sell the game to someone else when your done or bored of it, like how in the old days with physical games, there was GameStop stores as the middle man (the physical marketplace)\u2026 now \u2026 with the GameStop NFT Marketplace, if a game developer/studio onboards, they can enable the digital resale of games, and each time a used game trades hand, GME gets 2.5% commissions, like how a credit card company does as processing fees, and the original game development company can get a 10% cut for each and every time a \u201cused digital game\u201d exchanges hands, THEREFORE the used game market is modernized and is brought back to life in the digital world.. now the same thing applies with used digital anything, from movies (like my collection of iTunes movies I\u2019ve paid for) and my selectively paid for digital collection of music albums on various platforms\u2026 this is what they\u2019re ultimate plan is, hence they only charge 2.5% commissions because GME plans to be a large volume processor and won\u2019t want to compete with or been seen as a threat to the existing digital distribution ecosystem. Instead they would want to partner with them and enable these companies to make more money from the huge volumes of digital assets people already paid for and eager to make a resale! Knowing that I can resell my iTunes movies will allow me to binge purchase movies!\n\nAnd\u2026.\n\nImagine if GTA game started allowing you to actually buy and sell weapons and clothes and etc. for real money on an exchange with other players using a low fee NFT exchange that everyone already knows and trusts! The entire game industry is going cash money! The global games market is NOW over $180 BILLION, which is more than movie and music industry combined!\n\nTLDR;\n\nGME will push forward with \u2026 \n\n1) NFT as we know it yesterday\u2026 speculative digital art?\n\n2) NFT exchange to facilitate tradable progress/achievements within games (think GTA guns &amp; gear) between players.\n\n3) NFT as a resale marketplace for used digital games/movies/music by becoming a large volume processor like Visa.\n\nThis is like investing in Apple when it was about to go bankrupt and Microsoft had to bail them out!!\n\nTo the moon, and build a base!\nBUY, HODL, DRS!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: Just saying\u2026\n\nDo you mean like this one?

    "selftext": "*EDIT: Should be obvious to everyone reading the comments that this is NOT clear knowledge, as there are multiple different answers. At least some of you are confidently incorrect*\n\nThe record date is 7/18, the new shares are doled out by GME on 7/21, actual split occurs on 7/22.\n\nMy understanding is that I need to own the shares by 7/18 in order to receive the additional 3 shares. But I'm a bit confused about the actual implications.\n\nIf it were vital that I own the shares, then I'd have to factor in the T+2 settlement time, which I believe would make **Wed 7/13** the latest I could by shares. Or is it Thursday? \n\nSo, does this mean that if I buy 100 shares on, say, Thursday or Friday, that come 7/22 I will *not* get an extra 300 shares on 7/22?\n\nHow about all the GME options that will expire this Friday? Due to the T+2 delivery time, does that mean everyone who auto-exercises those ITM contracts on Friday will only get a 100 shares per contract, and will *not* receive the extra 300 share dividend on 7/22?",

It was to stop Elon Musk from nailing his assistants sister-in-law\u2019s aunt, who would eventually give birth to the asshole who built Skynet at 25 and caused all this hell. Thankfully, that\u2019s been taken care of. I got Elon to sleep with one of his executives instead. \n\nAnywho\u2026 I\u2019m trapped in 2022, so feel free to ask me anything about the market!\n\nEdit: sorry, but I\u2019m not a sports guy. I have not been keeping up to date with sports news\n\nEdit 2: wow thanks for so many great questions! I\u2019ll do my best to answer what I can, but apologies if I don\u2019t get to all of them!\n\nEdit 3: been getting a lot of recurring questions, so here are some quick ones:\n\n- GME will squeeze to $2000+ several months after the split, then the SEC will announce that it\u2019s getting delisted from NYSE and the stock will fall \n\n- Elon is still the wealthiest man \n\n- There are 3 Genders in 2052: man, woman, and cyborg \n\n- The orange guy won\u2019t be president again\n\n- COVID becomes a much simpler cold. People get an annual flu/COVID shot, and nobody really tests for it anymore.\n\n- Elon did not take over Twitter, and he won the lawsuit. Twitter had to testify in court that there were bots, and that screwed them over big time.\n\nEdit 4: DISCLAIMER!!! Keep this info to yourselves please. Knowing everything that I\u2019ve told you could mess with the timeline, and change the flow of events.",

Since then,  tech has been crushed, down 26.8% YTD, S&amp;P 500 down 18.95% YTD, and DOW down 13.9% YTD. Some of the \"top\" tech companies are down way more than that, Netflix down 71%, Shopify down 77%, Paypal down 63% etc. While I still think these stocks have room to decrease, this begs the question of are there any stocks that are still way up that have a shit ton of room to lose value and I should buy PUTS on? The answer is yes. From the Covid bottom (which to simplify things I marked as the date March 20, 2020) until when I ran this analysis on July 3, 2022, there were a ton of companies that were still up 1000%, 2000%, 3000%. Examples include RENN Up 3800%, AMR Up 3600%, AR Up 3100%, SM up 2700%, MVIS up 2000%, VTNR up 1800% etc. - Go look at their charts. I started buying PUTS on these companies and will continue doing so until they all burn. My positions are at the end of this post - Down over 50% since buying these PUTS :).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intro:**\n\nNo one should listen to me and this is NFA. I have most of my money in Gamestop, but decided to try and go out on my own and think for myself for once and take a couple thousand dollars to throw into options. The question I had in my head that I was trying to answer was simple. Since the market is trending downward and appears to be in a bear market, and a lot of tech stocks have already lost a shit ton of value...Are there any rando stocks that have increased a shit ton in value from the bottom of the covid dip but still haven't fallen in value in relation to current prices? \n\n**Process (Not that anyone gives a shit):**\n\nI got free data from [Stooq](https://stooq.com/db/h/) over the past couple decades. It's just open and close price data. Honestly not even sure how accurate it is but oh well, this is WSB. I did this ANALysis in less than a day so hopefully I didn't make a mistake...oops. I used four dates in particular:\n\n1. The pre-covid dip date of February 14th, 2020 (the approximate date before stocks started tanking leading up to COVID\n2. The Covid bottom date of March 20, 2020, which is the rough date when most stocks bottomed out and the Fed and JPOW turned that money printer up to full speed. Everything started increasing from then on.\n3. The EOY 2021 date of December 31, 2021 when most indexes peaked and hit ATH.\n4. The Date when I ran this ANALysis which was July 3, 2022\n\nFrom these dates I took the closing price of these days and calculated the percent increase of every stock in the NYSE and NASDAQ from the COVID bottom up until July 3, 2022. I really didn't expect much but boy was I wrong. Note that I had incomplete data, there are a number of tickers missing from the STOOQ website because certain dates closing prices were missing (oops).\n\nHere is a list of the top Increasing NASDAQ stocks from March 20, 2020 to July 3, 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ibk3xqpeub91.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1b245652b54a364abaee85017e13ac5d8f24b00\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a list of the top Increasing NYSE stocks from March 20, 2020 to July 3, 2022 (Hell yea GME):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fini9xcqeub91.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72b0f4cb60f5922320658efa0db275e84fa94e20\n\nIf you don't believe me, here are some of the tickers above with their charts provided:   \n\n\n**MVIS: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.18 to 07/01/2022 Price of 3.95, Up 2000%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/clh2nuh1gub91.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e0e1b4abf95d46a5831914617c21913bfacefd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VTNR: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.57 to 07/01/2022 Price of 10.72, Up 1800%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ux5skyopgub91.png?width=1454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be4993a5dc77e3e8af4ec3feb5d304dc98d742f9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RCMT: (03/20/2020 Price of 1.17 to 07/01/2022 Price of 19.23, Up 1500%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkcwjcq4hub91.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf7b0d8cb62814f314a37cdaac5992ace702cfd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RENN: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.75 to 07/01/2022 Price of 29.69, Up 3800%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/25eixsd0iub91.png?width=1406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3490fcb42ae6174b17c28849710a7d57a7332b2c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMR: (03/20/2020 Price of 3.38 to 07/01/2022 Price of 124.87, Up 3600%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9vimyv5iub91.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91e794c9c8908085ecc1b66802d3d6eb5fb399bc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AR: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.95 to 07/01/2022 Price of 30.74, Up 3100%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxsnwjgaiub91.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=315e99add0afd488b207a2b5e22d184add19c73e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SM: (03/20/2020 Price of 1.24 to 07/01/2022 Price of 34.08, Up 2600%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6shod7kdiub91.png?width=1506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=630085c0da0120fa205a3c37d071798544d01892\n\nSo now that you know I'm not full of shit, I used these top gainers to buy puts on since there was a trend reversal. Most of these peaked around the beginning of June, and started tanking since. So i used this and bought the following PUTs (With the exception of Airbnb and Wells Fargo - those were emotional plays because I think they are shit). \n\n(Far right column is Total Gain/Loss)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66adojw0lub91.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca78f18a252d6c09f76b435cfe683ee786f4eb5e\n\nAs you can see I'm doing really well, I still have until August so will post updates if anything changes. Until then... stay retarted and buy those 0DTE Options.",

The broker has a list of MMs that they pick between to sell your order to. We only pay if your order trades but if it's currently through the nbbo we have to make it trade. All of us MMs are ranked based on how far inside the nbbo we fill our average customer. Then based on a combination of relationships and our execution quality they give us more or less of the flow next month.\n\nIf you have any questions that you thought were too stupid to ask, I'm your man.

You don't need to downvote due to title.*\n\n# AMC\n\n**February last year in the black boxed out area:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jyhx76g2dc91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a551aaa96bbd1abf5cd3be6d33b23de2c6a25207\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z80ehu5bucc91.png?width=919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98fc86cf5994712499bd1414a3cafd0c31c7b6b\n\n**Why did $AMC stop and consolidate at $5.50-$6.00 in February of last year?**\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n1. **$5billion in debt due 2026**\n2. **Straight to streaming movie releases**\n3. **Covid-19**\n4. **Broker PCO and/or buying limits**\n5. **Dilution**\n6. **Institutional selling \\[Wanda\\]**\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n1. **Retail investors liked the price of the stock**\n2. **Biggest movie theater chain**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The company was not in great shape overall, yet the new found retail investors managed to stop the drop at approx $5.50. Short sellers had ridiculous price targets \\[even at 1 penny\\] which shows that a $5.50 drop was not low enough. After a bit of hanging around this level it popped up over $10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/el2fx15n3dc91.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e2b921fa650c28fa2a706a9d9d349686446278e\n\n&gt;It did its rip, an attempt to shake some retail out and it consolidated up high. The short sellers began to lose strength. Instead of now consolidating at $5-$6 it was consolidating over $10. Well if they cant get you to sell while its down or when its trading sideways... only one way for it to go and it is up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxt2ewaf4dc91.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fc66afcbc387f64d86cb15acfe97b636ba2bd3\n\n&gt;Now what we are looking at is something similar to February. They spiked the price down and yet AMC held its ground at around $10 instead of $5. They drove the price up a bit just like they did back then to try and shake some retail off, it worked as it now consolidated lower instead of higher like it consolidated last year. Now it seems to be trending upwards and some of those retail investors who jumped ship may now be loading the boat again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qckyhyv4dc91.png?width=919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=831347039fde7798e28663ea7fc48393f7d8b082\n\n&gt;Plenty of green now, strength is being shown in the price as of recent and it has been consistent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So now that is a break down on how the price has moved for the last year or so. Lets talk about what has changed this time around. This is the most vaguest of honestly in my opinion meaningless TA on AMC. That is just solely talking about price, to me it seems we are headed slowly into a spike as shorts are starting to worry. \\[at $16 short sellers are down 60% if short at $10, any short seller who is green may also be worried about diminishing profits\\]**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FTDS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sr1et1385dc91.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94591a727bbcad13fdc9974ea37c39055bb5e950\n\nAs of recent we had a massive spike of FTDs for AMC. June 28th approx $130m worth of shares \\[\\~2% of float\\] had FTDs. Think about that for a second, 2% of a FLOAT missing. To put that in perspective, you only need 0.5% of the float FTD for about two weeks to go on threshold securities list \\[normally only happens to penny stock\\]. This is 4x that. The HIGHEST FTD amount was approx 11m in May between the January-June run up.\n\n# ORTEX data\n\n\\[Two week lapse\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5as9kfi96dc91.png?width=737&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbf1e935612eb283ba9e5bd45e7e33cab3315251\n\nA steady increase in short interest shown above. Two week old so not up to date. Exchanged report SI % of FF is lower then June but much higher then the second consolidation levels in about April. It is also steadily rising along with the price which IMO is juicy, The lowest point prior to the June run up was about 17.6% of FF SI. We havent seen those number much since the drop in price in the June run up. It has been steadily rising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Higher REPORTED SI &amp;#37; of FF then the April consolidation.](https://preview.redd.it/1cuv88iu6dc91.png?width=354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b20fc98495b900cfa985491bfcb240bf0eae7ba3)\n\n# Highest short interest ever\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxtrxait7dc91.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7efcbca87010612252dc4d0f59bb13ef8ffe8f11\n\nUnlike % of FF this is amount of shares sold short with no relation of float and it is not % based. It is an important number to look at. Simply a huge amount of shares sold short.\n\n# Number of Loans per day, highest ever\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3skrqpa8dc91.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1ad056988a0cff8319af6aa1ecb925f7e4e043\n\n# Cost to borrow spiking to pre-June levels\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pwdhefh8dc91.png?width=317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aacb0f74c7e5a8ba33c6431b27d34910b57c1fc3\n\n# DTC/SIR highest since 2020\n\nShort Interest Ratio /Days To Cover \\[simply a mathematical equation that varies but for Ortex they do **shares on loan** and/or **estimated short interest** and DIVIDE it by **2 week and/or 3 month volume average.** Doing this you get 4 different number and all 4 are higher then prior to the June run up of last year. SIR/DTC is a number that is often used to verify if short sellers are having a hard time maintaining a short position on a stock. It is one of many short squeeze indicators.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/engmpguk8dc91.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8765637414bc75ad4a528132a1837bad2b214631\n\n# Utilization 100%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5y5gr6g79dc91.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9069848b24f4ad664a32b0e66f31ebda34d9c7e\n\nYeah.. that is some time with 100% utilization... what is important to note is that the shares on loan did change but they almost immediately borrow up every share made available. Utilization is a % of amount of shares that are being made available to borrow and how much of that is borrowed. If only 100k shares are borrowable and 100k are borrowed then we can have 100% utilization but that doesnt mean much if the float is 500m right? So the AMOUNT of shares being borrowed in correlation to that 100% is important. So yes they borrowed it all up, but how much shares were borrowed? Obviously they are in panic to borrow it all up right away but what was actually borrowed?\n\n# A fuck ton\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70pp05nt9dc91.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbe38049a9eee10053d107f1330f621138a76422\n\nJust like in June, the number spiked and began to take a dip as the price started to move up. Is that an indication of some lenders asking for shares back? In my unprofessional opinion... yes. More so evidence is that the shares are being returned and not made available again, Utilization remains 100%.\n\n# So what the F is the difference this time around?\n\nIf you are scared to buy into AMC, ~~then you are being a little bitch,~~ you need to realize the company fundamentals and TA is much stronger now then before.\n\nLets take a look at AMC last February:\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n1. ~~$5billion in debt due 2026~~  **restructured and now due 2029**\n2. ~~Straight to streaming movie releases~~  **Exclusive theatrical releases now**\n3. ~~Covid-19~~ **Nope**\n4. ~~Broker PCO and/or buying limits~~  **atleast not right now**\n5. ~~Dilution~~  **with what?**\n6. ~~Institutional selling \\[Wanda\\]~~  **majority held by retail who bought between $10 and $70.**\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\n1. **Retail investors liked the price of the stock**\n2. **Biggest movie theater chain**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The top 3 most important to take notice of is:**\n\n1. The debt is not due until 2029 so that blows a hole in many short thesis that existed last year when they managed to bring it to $5. I simply don't see it coming down to those levels.\n2. No PCO and/or buying limits. This is important. Imagine having a stock with limited or no buying allowed and the lowest it was brought is fuckin $5. So who is the risk of buying it at $10-$15? You are allowed to buy now so how can they bring it down to those levels again if buying is currently being allowed?\n3. Covid-19, limited seating, fears of catching the virus, Delta/Omnicron... all of that was happening last year and obviously put a bit of fear in the movie going experience. A lot of that is gone now. People are now flocking theaters... look at Minions/Spiderman No Way home.\n\nThese were the TOP THREE Shortseller talking points for AMC last year. I don't see any of these fundamentals growing for shortsellers, if anything all three are either weakening or don't exist anymore. The price of the stock currently in my eyes is super suppressed and the short sellers are not shorting because they believe its worth $5... they are shorting because they have no other choice. These clowns are fuckin trapped.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! Hope all is well.  I just wanted to share some chart's I colored on to show you that GME is about to see significant gains.  None of this is financial advice, I'm extremely retarded and eat crayons.  GME has been developing this triple bottom that we are seeing since 5/26.  A triple bottom is a very rare, but an extremely effective reversal pattern.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/ptyz9tesclc91.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195e052868c3f3336b83a190270c15aba3685921)\n\nThe pink line is showing the triple bottom I mention above.  Closing about 151 is the triple bottom high and that shows that a break out is coming.\n\nThe Purple arrow is showing a wedge break out that happened today\n\nThe MACD (orange arrow) - has been positive since 7/12.  It is diverging and going up\n\nStoch (blue) - is also going up with room for more\n\nA/D (red) - is going up\n\nAroon (yellow) - is also going up\n\nOverall- There are 2 very bullish patterns that GME is about to break out of. All indicators I use are pointing up as well.  we have seen green candles (for the most part) since the cross over on 7/12.  We are about to see even bigger green candles coming soon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nupdate 7/20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 day](https://preview.redd.it/qo6xrs6qoqc91.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb8114020e4dfaedb19aea94fbc711ac1fa0a9e0)\n\nGme had a successful break out this morning and looks like it will still continue up the diagonal support.  resistance at 160 and support at 155.\n\nall indicators are point up as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 4 hour chart](https://preview.redd.it/xit6va61qqc91.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29c3879b301c2aedf13faf1f89000bcac2a66663)\n\nit looks to me the gme is in an ascending channel and still will continue to climb up, I still speculate  a significant breakout coming.\n\nupdate 7/21 eod\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 day](https://preview.redd.it/bss2r30dxzc91.png?width=1142&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72346a6fd65d45d249d8a7213bb6ae4483de1da7)\n\nShorts tried to push it back down to the diagonal resistance and support.  They failed, GME is still climbing up the diagonal support. let me show you something super exciting if anyone is checking these updates\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 week](https://preview.redd.it/zykiaaooxzc91.png?width=1147&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3f4fa07ff1bfc7a4c3926732dcab6d38e5985f4)\n\nAll indicators are pointing up. this is on a 1 week macro scale, so we can see significant up tomorrow or next week. The fun is just beginning\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "title": "I've seen some dog water technical analysis on Gamestop's stock, so here's my technical analysis and an analysis of u/routine_huckleberry5's FUD and BS.",
    "selftext": "**Firstly, Here's Why** u/routine_huckleberry5**'s \"9/21 EMA\" is pure bs:**\n\nIn his chart, u/routine_huckleberry5 shows a basic strategy that every course-selling technical analysis guru uses - the most well-known and useless strategy out there, a MACD crossover. This strategy is dog water for two reasons: a MACD crossover is a lagging strategy, used mainly to determine trends in combination with other indicators, instead of having any real predictive value on its own. To explain it simply, a MACD crossover just shows that returns for a shorter-term period have been higher than returns for a longer-term period. If anything, such an indicator is actually a bad sign from a mean reversion perspective of T/A, as it could indicate the short-term profits might be overextended.  \n\nHe explained that the two profitable trades shown in the chart are **proof that the strategy works, and responded** to a redditor who called out his BS by saying the following:\n\n&gt;**\"**Uhmm,, it crossed DOWN in December as the chart shows, and look at the effect it had? Went from $182 down to $83**\"**\n\nTo test his **amazing** **\"strategy\"** of buying on the crossover and selling on the crossunder, I spent around 2 minutes to run a simple tradingview backtest. \n\n**Backtest Results for** u/routine_huckleberry5**'s strategy**\n\nThe backtest quickly showed that if you followed this 9/21 EMA strategy since the IPO of GME, **only 26%** of your trades would be profitable, and ignoring the two successful trades that u/routine_huckleberry5 was using to claim the strategy worked, you would have **lost over 81%** following this strategy since IPO (Jim Cramer level losses). Now the two trades that he did show in the graph were phenomenal, bringing the backtest back up to profitability, but they're clearly not representative of the larger sample, as shown by the enormous **drawdown of 92.52%** and the terrible profitability of the strategy. \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21.  \n\nOf course, the backtest's results are this bad, even while using the incorrect assumption that shorting can be done with 0% interest payments. \n\n[Chart 1: Backtest results for u\\/routine\\_huckleberry5's mindblowing strategy](https://preview.redd.it/6vtpi4wttic91.png?width=2682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e584372cc3e96ab67cb647328907729162805297)\n\n**With that out of the way, let us move on to some technical analysis:**\n\n[Chart 2: Weekly Candlestick of $GME ](https://preview.redd.it/2p5jqofxuic91.png?width=2678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f248ba4efab5fee64ad8062383c00adb50894d7)\n\nOne glance at $GME's charts should tell anyone that this stock is a bull without a head, and can run in a random direction very quickly. With this in mind, nobody can predict this stock with any degree of certainty unless they are manipulating the price. \n\nStarting with the T/A concepts of trends, support, and resistance, it should be clear to anyone that has studied technical analysis that chart 2 shows that $GME is running into an area of resistance around roughly 148 to 151, which was confirmed 3 times by pivot highs and one time with a bearish engulfing. GME is also trading below the moving average for the past 300 days. Both of these are signs it's better to be shorting the stock than to be in the stock right now. Of course, in theory, both of these signs can be reversed and broken, which is why I added extra indicators to check.    \n\n[Chart 3: Daily candlestick chart of $GME with MA 300, NDO 14, and SQZMOM Indicators as well as support and resistance levels drawn  ](https://preview.redd.it/xoqf6me9wic91.png?width=2684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9c117e8a31c6df5c83233d2aa6dc88b4df964a)\n\nThe two indicators called NDO (Normal Distribution Outliers) calculate a z-score for volume, which helps determine if the volume is statistically significant for a day. In this case, both the NDO 14 with normal volume and the NDO 14 with short volume for the past week have been fairly insignificant, falling within less than 1 times the 14-day standard deviation of their average. This takes the short squeeze argument away from shills, as the short volume is nothing special now, and so a short squeeze can't happen. It also shows that the recent 1 week's rally doesn't have much strength behind it, as few shares traded hands.  \n\nOn the other hand, using Lazybear's Squeeze Momentum indicator, which is pretty good at spotting reversals and momentum in the short term, the indicator has turned to green, which is generally a good sign for a stock, showing some squeeze potential, however, the size of the green candle is so minor I don't believe that GME will be able to break resistance at the level around 148 to 153. \n\nSo overall, technical analysis of $GME reveals that the stock will most likely not go far above 153 in the short term. Of course, if a whale suddenly jumps in and buys 5 minionillion shares then the price will rise, but in my opinion, this is less likely than the possibility of $GME's stock going down in value in the short run. \n\nP.S. if anything, DO NOT BUY OPTIONS RIGHT NOW if you don't know the basics of option greeks. According to ivolatility.com, the current implied volatility is around 131.22%, whereas the 30 historical volatility is 86.45%, a difference of 44.77 percentage points. This means u will get fucked by theta for buying options\n\nEdit : apparently cramer was bearish on gme, therefore all my calculations r wrong, and its Hella bullish rn. Gme  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: the combination of cramer bearishness and another redditor posting technical analysis with more lines and colors than me means the price might actually break out rn and moon. It's too risky a trade for me, but I wish all bulls good luck!\n\nEdit 3: GME to 0 EOY. It crashed hard.",

MS has kept very detailed notes about my investments and where I trade at, after a few moments he asked if I still held AMC, GME and a few others. He asked how many AMC and I told him 12,000 plus and he said to not sell and they would love to help me set up an account with them. He even offered me a very attractive interest bearing account to move money his way. He asked me to send a screen shot of my holdings to see how they can help me reach my goals. He did say I should hang on to the AMC. I think they are a good group but this was an unusual phone call. What are your thoughts?",

    "title": "RKT the Spanish Inquisition of meme stocks",
    "selftext": "Looking back at the GME and AMC runs of that last year. We can draw a few conclusions on why they worked. They blindsided the Hedgies because who in their right mind would invest in game stop? Digital downloads should be making game stop be irrelevant. Yet a hand full of smart people could see this was overblown and GME has growth and life ahead of it. AMC was all so declared dead by Wallstreet because of covid. \n\nI present you with RKT. Rocket mortgage. Right now Rocket been beaten to its knees with the rest of the market. Housing is been declared dead. Rightfully so most would add with rates going up mortgages slowing. Sound familiar, no one on Wallstreet wants to touch this company or retail for that matter. It\u2019s how you can bleed a stock down over 50% from its highs. It\u2019s when people are dead set on a companies doom that we have the most opportunity. Ask you self this, arnt we all cheering for the housing market to crash so we can buy a home ourselves. That demand for a home is why housing never truly dies. It will correct like any market but in the end of the day people want to own homes, go to the movies and go down to the game store to bullshit and buy the new copy of call of duty. \n\nThe other thing that GME and AMC had going for it was high short Interest and a small float. Rough estimates on RKT shot interest sitting at 31%. I say rough because as we know shorts have ways to manipulate this data. Shares are also hard to short at the current moment and expensive. \n\nLike GME before it\u2019s squeeze the sellers in RKT have been largely exhausted. I can confidently say this by just looking at todays trading action. CNBC top page articles was about the slowing housing market. \u201cMortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers\u201d and \u201cJune home sales fall 5.4% from May, as prices set yet another record.\u201d\nDespite these headlines RKT was up 1.6% as of me writing this. \n\nHow is this possible? Because of 3 things.\n\n1. We have reached a bottom in sellers. The people who bought this at 20 have either sold are now longs. \n\n2. The market is forward looking and like me a lot of people are starting to think we saw the peak of inflation. Gas is coming down a number of commodity\u2019s have come down a lot very recently. Feds going to raise another .75 or a full point. The effect of which should bring down inflation further. If inflation chills out we can see the fed Slow down. Rates for home loans will follow suite. If and in my opinion when recession. Is declared on the as we creep close to an election. The fed will be hard pressed to remain hawks as the economy worsens. They would likely cut rates to bring back jobs. If the worst is behinds us when we have chill adjustment period with rates staying even for a while. Still much better for the housing market. RKT lender is the largest and has the most capital of all the mortgage players to take advantage when they rates turn\n\n3. COE and CFO have been buying the dip. They have been in the The mortgage business for over 30 years. They know how to play these cycles. 08 being a prime example while other mortgage lenders went belly up RKT took advantage of the carnage in the following years and 3 to 4xed the company to over take wellsfargo as the largest lender in the country. \n\nRKT to me is a rocket just waiting for buyers to trigger the launch sequence.",

I was scared because no one else in my life loved me and I didn\u2019t want him to abandon me so I let him anally violate me. And it kept happening over and over and I didn\u2019t tell my parents because I was ashamed. I couldn\u2019t help myself. It kept escalating and eventually I was taking his raw cock daily. He eventually suggested having a gang bang with his friends and they all laughed at how pathetic I was while they all took my hole and some of their cocks were so big that my asshole was destroyed and had fissures and tears. I cried while getting raped and hated myself for crying because the sadistic bastards got more excited and went harder. I was in school getting extra shame piled on because the teacher would give me a hard time for taking extra time in the washroom because it hurt so bad to go after what he and his friends had done to me. But I let it keep happening again and again because my parents didn\u2019t love me and he was nice to me so I was psychologically helpless to escape the abuse.

I was at the mercy of my own financial situation and made terrible decisions as a result. I\u2019m adding insult to injury by making this post so you degenerates can finger my sore infected asshole and literally rub it in and add extra cum to the bloody mess to make sure I get AIDS and am reminded of my suffering for the rest of my life every time I take my Truvada in the morning.\u201d\n\nFUCK YA!\n\nSo if you\u2019re going to hurt yourself sharing loss porn\u2026do it right.\n\nExpose yourself properly so that we can see your wounds and salt them while pretending to care.\n\nPut yourself one step closer to the loony bin or suicide.

    "title": "The Story of a Regular Investard, journey of 20k to 150K to 10k to beyond",
    "selftext": "Sit down, smack down, lube it up, let it go. \n\nGet ready for this story of volatility, extremity, regardrarity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs once the wise tendie gods, crazy apes, and regard pigs all say, a goldfish can invest in 2020 and make 300% return. \n\nMy journey started in 2020, my family was a traditional working class family, I've heard that my dad lost 10k or 20k in the 2008 crash, but he stopped investing anything after that. Due to this, I got into investing late. Sometime around 2020 right after COVID, one of my buddy recommended me to buy oil and gas stocks. I obliged and put in 20k in GUSH, I think back then it was trading at $40 or so. And also some changes in hotels, GME, AMC, Etc. \n\nAround the beginning of 2021, I was up to 40 or 50k. From there, hearing the news of Ocugen awaiting vaccine approval from the FDA, I was able to scope up Ocugen for $0.10 a share or so, later on in the year I made about 10 to 20k on Ocugen selling it around $8. At this point, I was strictly shares, I did not have any derivatives of any sort. \n\nEnd of 2021, I played around with meme stocks such as PLTR, SPCE, Steel gang, etc. Initially, the success was apparent, WSB was full of pump and dump posts regarding these tickers. I kept a consistent gain selling in morning by monitoring the ticker appearances on the sub. From here I reached around $110k in liquidity starting from 20k in 2020. \n\nAt the end of 2021, I've read about the electric bus program and electric charging stations, and Biden's plan of pushing green energy and passing a new bill. I bought CHPT and PTRA before the bill got passed. This was my downfall. I think my net profit from both tickers was around 10k-20k if realized; however, as a newbie investard I had very unrealistic expectation for both tickers, I think I still do, that's why I lost so much money. \n\nThe gay lord Gabe visited me and gave me the idea of joining the regards of option trading. At first I was doing well, riding the SPY wave up and down and selling in time to cash about 15k of profit. Then March of 2022 hits, I wanted to go for a YOLO play so I bought about 70k of Put option expiring in two weeks, 390P set on SPY. And we all know what happened during March FOMC, stock market rallied, and we stormed all the way back to $460, I still think that shit is crazy as fuck. \n\nThe problem with me is, I get too greedy and refuse to take profits and I sleep too fucking late. Regarded me be like sleeping one hour late and missing $5000 of profit, or I would hold on to option just a few days longer when it loses all the value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much it, I know it's not as glamorous as some regards here, but I will have 2 Alaskan King Crab with fresh butter and a diet Doctor Pepper.

There should be an existing downtrend in place before the pattern occurs.\n2. The three lows should be roughly equal in price and spaced out from each other. While the price doesn't have to be exactly equal, it should be reasonably close to the same price, such that a trendline is horizontal.\n3.

    "selftext": "So what kind of coked out adderall overdose made me go bold with this prediction of imminent doom when the market has been doing uppies all week? It's pretty simple. Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting. Then on Thursday we have the Q2 GDP numbers come out confirming we're officially in a recession. (a fact I called last October btw, it just took a couple months for the data to catch up) The real action though is in the Thursday after hours Earnings Reports. Specifically, the ERs for two of the biggest companies on the planet, both of which I expect to fail spectacularly.\n\nApple and Amazon.\n\nJust in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.\n\nI think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?\n\nFor Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Amazon C-Suite](https://preview.redd.it/pnhvt5avduc91.jpg?width=202&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05b98c07a8fc2cc1a5eba7ba2a12275fe2c681f)\n\nFor Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China. If you haven't noticed, China ~~is currently approaching~~ [has reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlpC5OC0q_A) the \"tanks in the streets\" level of civil unrest and banking collapse due to the ponzi scheme real estate and infrastructure plan they've been running finally collapsing. (if you need a primer on why and how that's collapsing, see the DD \"One Company, Two Debts\" pinned to my profile from 10 months ago - I been like Burry level ahead of all this shit)\n\nSo, to recap, on 7/27, you're going to have a FED rate hike, then on 7/28 you're going to see headlines screaming about how we're officially in recession all day, then that night you'll see two of the biggest pillars of the market report dumpster fire earnings. Given all that, what do you think boomers and algos and momos are going to do Friday morning?\n\nSo I just scrapped my 21 year old pickup after the motor blew. I'm gonna spend $200 on this lotto play. I've put in $100 so far, I'll throw in the other Benji sometime between Friday and Tuesday.\n\n**3 D0G 8/19 41c**\n\n**1 AMZN 7/29 101p**\n\n**1 AAPL 7/29 133p**\n\n**2 SPY 8/19 315p**\n\nNormally this would be flared as a yoyololo, but I'm not putting nearly as much $$ on this as required by sub rules, so I guess meme since I'm not including enough info for a real DD post? But if you need evidence of conviction, my house has a 30-year fixed 2% mortgage, and I'm currently selling it to go live in my buddies basement to try and front-run the real estate collapse - I'm probably too late, but we'll see!\n\n**TLDR: Black Friday next week (maybe, but maybe not, I'm only putting $200 on this)**\n\nAs far as an update on my food shortage play, I'm now up to 20 1/23 calls on W3AT and 5 11/18 calls on S0YB, I just keep buying that sweet dip. Once I get enough S0YB calls I'll be adding some C0RN as well.\n\nFinally, more than 95% of my total port is now long GME.",

But people were dumb and bought shares.\n\nBecause most large institutions didn't anticipate these purchases to happen they were caught off guard in their short positions. The value of the shares went up really high and then crashed back down. This screwed over some institutions and made early investors a lot of money.\n\nThis also created a lot of bag holders because people were greedy. A lot of people didn't want to miss out on the squeeze and bough in too late. They got caught up in the hype and threw lots of money in on the way up just to lose it on the way down.\n\nThey wanted to get their money back and the solution to make that happen was to spread a bunch of misinformation online to encourage people to keep buying as many GME shares as possible. They succeeded and caused the shares to keep trading at a higher cost by getting enough idiots to buy and they recouped some of their losses.\n\nNow a whole bunch of idiots are holding a whole bunch of shares and not selling because they don't want to give up on hope or admit to themselves that they listened to bad advice online.\n\nThe company now has \\*correction\\* an 11.7 billion dollar market cap that they could leverage to restructure the company and turn profitable again. But the company was failing for a reason.\n\nTheir idiotic management decided to make an NFT marketplace instead. Which is basically the equivalent of selling overpriced image files that will do nothing but depreciate in value over time when the hype wears off. They're essentially the digital equivalent of beanie babies.\n\nJust like the share price right now, they are essentially only worth what idiots are willing to pay for them and don't have any intrinsic value. Human minds are fickle and this is destined to turn into a catastrophe similar to the great beanie baby crash of 1999.\n\nWhy am I griping about this now? I guess because I just want this bullshit to die so that I can go online and try to come up with some solid strategies to make money on stocks or options without being endlessly spammed with increasingly schizophrenic sounding GME posts.\n\nOh right there is a 4:1 split and today the shares are going to start trading on a split adjusted basis. What does this mean for the stock? It means absolutely nothing!\n\nIf you have $1 you have $1. If you have 4 quarters you have $1. The only real reason share splits are done is because people are fucking idiots. People perceive lower numbers as cheaper and are more likely to buy even if there is actually no reason whatsoever to do so.\n\nSo it can give the share price a temporary boost before people lose interest and get into something else when it just keeps trading sideways on lack of news.\n\nWhat impact will this have on GME? I have no clue. Why? GME isn't rational anymore. GME is like that kid you went to school with who gave no fucks, showed up high on LSD and somehow still aced his biochemistry exam. That kid did later die by electrocution because he thought he was a monkey and the power station down the street was a jungle. But everyone remembers that kid.\n\nNo one remembers Elissa, the quiet mild mannered girl who didn't talk much, studied diligently and aced all her classes. She's now the CEO of a boring company that sells generic brand pharmaceutical products online and is worth 1.2 billion. But everyone remembers that crazy ass kid Michael who went out in a literal blaze of glory due to a mescaline induced stupor. Even the traumatized paramedics who showed up to the scene to find brain matter, bone chunks and bits of skin stuck to the fence remember Michael.\n\nWhere am I going with this? I don't even know, but it makes more sense than that post that is currently pinned that is basically something that Michael would have written while he somehow impressed his friends as well as the scientific community by remaining conscious enough to write while having done a heroes dose of DMT.\n\nWhat's going to happen to GME tomorrow? I don't fucking know. I have no predictions and no way of making them. It's like trying to predict what Michael was going to be doing on a Friday night. It's a futile endeavor. Michael himself probably didn't know what he was doing half the time because he was just running from his demons in any way he could.\n\nWhen there is irrationality there is no way to make predictions. That's why GME is a no go for me. There is no rational way to predict what GME is going to do tomorrow. That's why I have no position on either the short or long side and I won't.\n\nI'm tired of hearing about something unpredictable that I can't make money off of because it's unpredictable.\n\nThen there is Elissa. She was predictable. If I could have bought calls on Elissa's grades in school I would have because there was like a 99% chance they would print.\n\nElissa, in case the reader is full on retardant (unlike Michael who combusted) , is a metaphor for the types of plays I want to be fucking reading about. Yeah, Michael was entertaining. But Elissa was basically a blue chip. You knew when she would succeed and when she would fail. Long on Elissa's grades and short on Elissa's social life. That's the kind of reliable plays I want to make.\n\nI tried to figure out how the GME share price would respond to the split. Guess what? There is no fucking point to even try to figure it out. GME do what GME do. Ape do what ape do.\n\nThat is all. Some things just aren't rational. Happy split day!\n\nWhatever does happen today, though, I'm sure will go down in history as something absolutely fucking crazy. Good luck, you're gonna need it since logic has gone out the window and there are no signs of it coming back.\n\nYes, I kept writing AFTER I said that is all. Why? Perhaps a metaphor for the irrational behavior of everyone's favorite stupidstonk. Cheers.",

Some say in fact that once the shit hits the fan they\u2019ll be the new currency for lack of clean alternatives.\n\nIssue as I see it is fungibility since as we all know one anal bead is not like the next by either size, comfort or barrier to entry. There has to be a clear way forward to determining superior beads since right now it can be a painstakingly slow process which requires extra outlays/sunk costs due to large Vaseline expenditures.\n\nThoughts on the future of this asset class?

I thought we were in the end game (honestly, we probably were) but the can got kicked again. \n\nI quit because I hated my job, wanted access to my $250k 401k so I could buy more GME and I wanted to spend time with my kids before they went back to school. I did a full YOLO direct rollover with my $250k and bought in at $300+ which took me like 3 months to get over because I could have had 3 times the amount of shares had I waited or dollar cost averaged. (I know\u2026.. a true ape) \n\nFast forward 14 months and somehow I have managed to survive without any income. I sold my truck that was paid off. I sold my RZR for a small profit. I got some money back from my tax return but I\u2019m afraid I have nothing more to sell and it\u2019s time for me to return to the workforce. After everything we\u2019ve been through I can honestly say I have no regrets. I have enjoyed the time spent with my family. I\u2019ve picked up a few new skills. I\u2019ve lost 30lbs from diet and exercise. I\u2019ve read 10 new books. I\u2019ve learned to live more within my means and most of all RC gave me a stock split that makes me feel better about my $300 buy in. \n\nThis leads me to my main point. I have a job interview tomorrow morning which I feel pretty confident about. My mentality has shifted to the realization that I have to go back to work next month. I have nothing of valuable to sell. My son starts Kindergarten next week. And GME isn\u2019t going to take off until we are fully DRS\u2019d.\n\nOr is it\u2026\u2026..?\n\nI don\u2019t know. All I know is whenever I make a decision and accept it something unexpected happens.\n\nTLDR; Be Patient. The best things happen unexpectedly. Nearly all the best things that came to me in life have been unexpected, unplanned by me.",

    "title": "$GME Technical Analysis",
    "selftext": "Hey guys, I decided to post my technical analysis of $GME. Initially, I wasn\u2019t going to post anything, given that there are so many $GME bulls within this subreddit that would almost certainly throw hate. But anyways\u2026 moving on. I think many of us were anticipating greater movement towards the upside following the stock split. However, given the macroeconomic backdrop and rising fears of a recession, $GME doesn\u2019t appear to be breaking out. Yes, I\u2019m fully aware that $GME isn\u2019t like any other stock, especially given the amount of YOLO traders \ud83d\ude09 continuing to push its price higher. Albeit, at this point, I would argue that retail investor capital is drying up, making it harder for the bulls to contend with the bears (at least in the interim). In addition, the increasingly bearish outlook for the retail sector has been contributing to the cuts in valuations within the sector.\n\nSo\u2026 it\u2019s now time for me to pull out my crayons \ud83d\udd8d with the aim of illustrating a potential $GME short-term tumble. My \u201cwork\u201d primarily consists of analyzing the MACD and RSI indicators. I noticed that every time (for the past year and a half) that the MACD line crossed the signal line, a downside followed (see red arrows -&gt; 10/10 times -&gt; there aren\u2019t any exceptions). Downsides averaged -33.9% from the day $GME recorded a second (and consecutive) negative MACD spread to the day the stock bottomed and a reversal followed. On average, it took 16.3 days for the stock to bottom (or 11.5 trading sessions).\n\n[Timeframe: 2021 -\\&gt; 07\\/27\\/2022 using 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/7lt85brjc7e91.jpg?width=1307&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d0609fd3cad7e612ac1cafa333c28ffdb6ea5ab)\n\nSo\u2026 why should anyone care?? Well, $GME recorded a negative MACD spread of -0.17 on 07/26/2022. In addition, RSI (from the moment a trade would\u2019ve been theoretically executed based on the above MACD strategy) is aligned with historical averages and indicates an opportunity to execute a bearish strategy. ***A reminder that this is not financial advice. Please do your own DD before investing.***\n\nNow, there\u2019s strong support at the $29 level (after split). According to the historical average downside (-33.9% -&gt; see above) following a negative MACD spread (and if history were to repeat itself in accordance with this average), it would suggest that we could potentially see $GME bottoming out at the $22 level in the short-term (see the pink line). On that note, there isn\u2019t as strong of support at the $22 level, which makes the $19.50 level slightly probable.\n\n[Timeframe: May 2022 -\\&gt; 07\\/27\\/2022 using 1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/o633pf9wc7e91.jpg?width=1418&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5180d608b80b1c669072fc21e35d67075f0c672b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am aware that the MACD can bear a false signal, but I believe I have accounted for that by ensuring the indicator records a second (and consecutive) negative result (just like the U.S. GDP coming out this Thursday lol). I also ensure that the second negative spread is strictly less than the first spread (i.e., more negative than the first).\n\nAnyways, on that note, I bought some $GME 32.50 puts expiring Aug. 26th. Again, this ISN\u2019T financial advice. I hope you appreciate the slightly different insight (especially since we usually see extremely bullish DDs &amp; Charts). I\u2019m not saying that $GME won\u2019t eventually go to the moon \ud83d\ude80; this is simply my short-term play.\n\nPlease go easy on me in the comments\ud83d\ude43",

I also ensure that the second negative spread is strictly less than the first spread (i.e., more negative than the first).\n\nAnyways, on that note, I bought some $GME 32.50 puts expiring Aug. 26th. Again, this ISN\u2019T financial advice. I hope you appreciate the slightly different insight (especially since we usually see extremely bullish DDs &amp; Charts). I\u2019m not saying that $GME won\u2019t eventually go to the moon \ud83d\ude80; this is simply my short-term play.\n\nPlease go easy on me in the comments\ud83d\ude43",

    "title": "When's the last time you purchased anything from GameStop? A dive into the anecdotal evidence.",
    "selftext": "We all know the story on GameStop by now so I don't want to get into the trading hype side of things.  To be frank, the entire thing smells pretty fishy, to the point my nose suffered so much I had no choice but to do a little investigating to alleviate the fishyness in my nostrils.  So I started digging around to see if I could come up with anything.  I started with the Q1 earnings report, in case you didn't hear, GME's earning increased year over year for Q1.  I pulled a couple highlights below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Net sales were $1.378 billion for the quarter, compared to $1.277 billion in the prior year\u2019s first quarter.\n* Sales attributable to new and expanded brand relationships contributed to the Company's growth in the quarter.\n* Inventory was $917.6 million at the close of the quarter, compared to $570.9 million at the close of the prior year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting a continued focus on improving in-stock levels in merchandise to meet increased customer demand and offset supply chain headwinds.\n\n[GameStop Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Results](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2022-results)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sure looks like they're doing great until you dig a little deeper.  Now I am aware that GameStop claims to do about 34% of it's business via e-commerce ( [GameStop Reports 2020 Holiday Sales Results](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company\u2019s $1.0 billion growth objective;\n\nBut this figure was from 2020 and GameStop has since gone quiet about their e-commerce.  Why is that?  It's because no one bloody purchases anything from GameStop online.  It's hard to provide concrete evidence but I welcome anyone to do this for themselves.\n\nI visited all the top Discord servers, MineCraft, Fortnite, Apex legends, etc.  The experience was excruciating but the information gained was invaluable.  I simply asked when is the last time anyone purchased anything from GameStop online.  I was expecting my result to be low and it did not disappoint.  Out of the survey of about 3 - 4 thousand people in my estimation, only 12 said they had purchased anything from GameStop online.\n\n34% my ass, is anyone checking up on this figure?  I don't think so, I believe this to be a massive over estimation.  However I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, that still leaves 66% (illuminati number) left over in physical sales.  So I went out to see how this 66% of physical sales is doing... but in real life.\n\nI live close to Philadelphia so you can verify these locations for yourself.  I simply sat outside these locations and counted the customers, I also went inside to grab a snapshot of the state of the store.  Now when I tell you these locations were dead that would be an understatement.  We're talking low margin sales with at minimum 2 employees on duty, at least while I was observing.  And on top of that the stock they keep in these stores is insane, half of them are outdated games and we can't even see what they have in the back. I stayed at each location for 3 hours between 4 - 7 PM.\n\nWarminster PA - 6 total customers, 2 of whom were kids waiting on the mom at the haircuttery next door shelves full\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/8hsGtuz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo)\n\nEwing NJ - 8 customers, but again 2 were a father and son waiting on the mom getting a haircut, side note why are there so many haircutterys next door to Gamestop?.  shelves were full, but I did manage to get a snapshot of a couple people\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/CHLjNlN](https://imgur.com/a/CHLjNlN)\n\nGloucester Twp - Here we did manage to hit double digits with 11 total customers, one happy couple bought a new PS5, ca-ching for GME I guess,  but I don't think it's enough to pay for the 3 employees that were working and overhead.  WHY DO THEY NEED SO MUCH INVENTORY THOUGH?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/q5pk7dO](https://imgur.com/a/q5pk7dO)\n\nWarrington PA - This was my last stop and the slowest of them all, 3 total customers, and I don't think any of them bought anything.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/s1CeQOe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo)\n\nMy conclusion: GME is basically a modern day BlockBuster that's already dead but is being propped up by the markets to rob the meme stockers.  This may only be anecdotal evidence but it is damning none the less.  They are operating their stores at a massive loss and inflating their e-commerce numbers.  The only way it makes sense is if it's one big money laundering operation, which I guess isn't completely impossible.",

The insane short interest  - 2 million or whatever - even that is not unheard of.\n\nWhat makes this truly unique is the call option contracts coupled with the small float. Retail can spend $3,000 on 100 shares or $3,000 on six $30 call options that cause the option writing funds to buy 600 shares as soon as the contracts go ITM.\n\nThere are over 6,000 August call option contracts that are ITM according to Yahoo from strikes ranging from $2.50-$30. That alone is over 600K shares locked in hedge. That doesn't consider the volume on each strike today, the fact that the $35 strikes and likely $40 strikes are going ITM tomorrow and the open interest on the September to February options.\n\nGamma squeeze indeed.

    "selftext": "https://newsfilter.io/a/53a8668b31a68335d92b3c59bb0d0a8f\n\nLock and load retards. AMC is doubling its shares in a preferred short position. What does that mean? Hedgies are double deep and having to buy a share of the new ticker, designated APE, and will have 2 days to fill every order of an entirely new ticker.\n\nEDIT 1: Well I\u2019m a retard, so go figure I\u2019d mess this up on my first go-round. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019m on here, after all. \n\nWith $APE, there will be a total of 516,820,595 individual shares to be distributed in a quantity coinciding with the count of the current float. If you own a legitimate share of $AMC, you will get a share of $APE. AA stated this is essentially going to function like a share count. Shorts will have to purchase and provide shares for each short they hold position in. They will have 2 days to do this from when $APE goes up, market makers will have 35 calendar days to cover because fuck you, they get 35 days. This is POTENTIALLY the same reason we haven\u2019t seen much happening after the GME split - we haven\u2019t reached the 35 day mark. This is also not inherent dilution because while $APE can be traded for a share of $AMC, that will have to happen only with the approval of shareholders at a future date. As of right now, $APE is its own ticker. \n\nThis is not financial advice. I don\u2019t claim that any of this is factual or even remotely correct because I have 2 brain cells and you should do your own damn research. I\u2019m sure I have continued to fuck this up somehow anyway. I\u2019m not an expert. Like I said before: there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m here and not somewhere else. \n\nI am also openly challenging u/Stylux to a bet if they aren\u2019t too afraid.

A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders and is determined by the company's board of directors. Dividends are often distributed quarterly and may be paid out as cash or in the form of reinvestment in additional stock.\n\nDefinition for stock split:\n\n&gt;What Is a Stock Split? A stock split happens when a company increases the number of its shares to boost the stock's liquidity. Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same because a split does not fundamentally change the company's value.\n\nSo in laymen terms, a stock dividend is when the company shares its profits with investors either through a cash dividend or gives then increased equity with a stock dividend. DO NOT confuse this with a \u201cstock split via dividend\u201d. A stock split is simply when a company decided to split the amount of shares in a company without changing the overall value or market cap of the company.\n\nYou know gme had a stock split for several reasons. One, they did not share any profits with share holders. They have 0 profits to share to begin with. Two, they did not give anyone increased equity in the company through this dividend. Three, every share holder owns the exact same percentage of the company they did before the split. Just distributed over more shares.\n\nSo why is it called a \u201cstock split via dividend\u201d then?\n\n&gt;\u00a7 173. Declaration and payment of dividends. No corporation shall pay dividends except in accordance with this chapter. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation\u2019s capital stock. If the dividend is to be paid in shares of the corporation\u2019s theretofore unissued capital stock the board of directors shall, by resolution, direct that there be designated as capital in respect of such shares an amount which is not less than the aggregate par value of par value shares being declared as a dividend and, in the case of shares without par value being declared as a dividend, such amount as shall be determined by the board of directors. **No such designation as capital shall be necessary if shares are being distributed by a corporation pursuant to a split-up or division of its stock rather than as payment of a dividend declared payable in stock of the corporation.**\n\n&gt;8 Del. C. 1953, \u00a7 \u2002173;  56 Del. Laws, c. 50;  59 Del. Laws, c. 437, \u00a7 \u200210;  65 Del. Laws, c. 127, \u00a7 \u20025;\n\nGameStop is based in Delaware. Delaware, like any other state, has specific laws governing how dividends work. What this is basically saying is you can have a cash dividend, a property dividend, or shares in the company. If you\u2019re going to pay a share dividend, then no shares should have a value less than the par value of the other shares of that class. If they are going to be less then that would be decided by the board and they might be a different class of shares. In either case, capital has to be designated for doing so, ie, using company profits.\n\nOR there is no need to designate ANY capital IF you just split the shares. Ergo, a stock split. That is the part I highlighted in bold.\n\nIt\u2019s the exact same thing as a forward split. I\u2019m not sure Delaware law allows you to call it a forward split but it works exactly like a forward split.\n\n&gt;The most common type of stock split is a forward split, which means a company increases its share count by issuing new shares to existing investors. For example, a 3-for-1 forward split means that if you owned 10 shares of company XYZ before it split, you'd own 30 shares after the split took effect. However, the overall value of your investment wouldn't change (at least in theory). So a forward split results in more outstanding shares but a lower price for each share, with no net gain or loss in the company's overall market value.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that sound exactly like GameStop\u2019s \u201csplit via dividend\u201d? That\u2019s because it is.\n\nSo the gme filing said shares will be distributed from GameStop to shareholders. Distributed in this context just means they voted to 4x shares and every share holder will get 4x shares they currently hold. It doesn\u2019t mean that Ryan Cohen or Matt furlong will personally go around to each of your brokers and hand out a limited quantity of shares for each registered share holder. It doesn\u2019t mean they are \u201cdistributing\u201d stock certificates to each holder. It means the distribution of company wealth or market cap changes from 78m shares to ~250m shares. The same way that you can distribute $10 over 40 quarters or 100 dimes. It\u2019s the same amount of money with a different distribution. The board and share holders voted on that, but they\u2019re not physically distributing shares. Each individual share doesn\u2019t have a stock certificate. Stock certificates haven\u2019t been used for over 20 years.\n\nSo when some brokers say \u201cwe\u2019ve received the shares from Dtc\u201d (seems to be the German brokers) either it\u2019s a mistranslation, the service rep doesn\u2019t understand how it works, or they literally just mean \u201cwe\u2019ve been given the instructions by the DTC to officially perform the split.\u201d It DOES NOT mean they received a limited basket of shares from the DTC.\n\nMods please delete or reflair if this post is too regarded for this sub",

    "selftext": "I feel like I am getting a brain aneurism reading through 99% of the posts regarding a short squeeze on BBBY. It feels like I am in the BEETEECEE subreddits. **Before you downvote me, bitch, know that I am LONG the stock - for the retarded goldfish in the back: that means I am BULLISH.**\n\nTo start this short post off: suck my dick you fucking nerd bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpwx6211mxf91.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc29e8a6b33f527faded58a9a213c10f6e5530a8\n\n**Disclaimer: I am BULLISH on BBBY because it is a deep value play against bankruptcy, which I believe won't happen. Add the SWAP correlation to other ,,meme stocks'' into the mix as well as the exposure from over-shorting (personal opinion) and mis-pricing in the market, as well as Ryan Cohen, then you got a no-brainer. Similar setup as Gamestop, though I believe not quite as spicy due to the lack of appeal compared to Gamestop. Fuck I loved Gamestop's setup so much I bought XXXX in November 2020 for 11$. This is not the same.**\n\nSponsored by Kenny G\n\n\\---------\n\n**What do you need for a fucking short squeeze?**\n\n**Shorts that feel forced to close their positions and a dropping short interest.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Are shorts forced to close their positions?**\n\nIdeally we would need an environment where a short position is under water and the hedge fund feels threatened that it gets worse. And even then they would most likely hold out because retail usually doesn't execute calls which frees up shares from delta hedging to drop the share price strategically when volume drops.\n\nAlso, not implying that there are any bad actors, you could use a befriended market maker to supply liquidity and short the fuck out of the stock to scare away those piling into options and calls today. You can fuck them in any way possible.\n\nSo let's see if shorts are most likely under water. The closest guess we can make is to check how long the price has been below the current price. For the sake of it, let's say 8$. Because the longer we are under water, the sooner they will close out and seek a better opportunity in the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xfelg1rgxf91.png?width=1510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1712b839134d1339308b90a59a7dc3378c2220ba\n\nWe have exactly been approximately one month in 2020 (covid crash) and one month prior to today below the current price. So to be underwater with your position, you must have opened a short position ONLY in the past 3 weeks and at the very end of the covid crash. Not before, not after. That's only a level of being retarded that WSB or Jim Cramer could achieve. Also given the comparably low volume of last month, its highly unlikely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell maybe before that short positions were opened like on GME and they held through the whole time to hit bankruptcy jackpot?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0ezutvdhxf91.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6846572d3e827edff1452e9ce20855b50262351a\n\nThe last time BBBY was below current levels was in 1997. So before most of you fucktards were even born. And the price action doesn't really look like it was shorted back then because those shorts would have been closed out when BBBY hit 80$ more than a decade later.\n\nWhat about rising cost to borrow as another indicator of SHFs scrambling to get shares to close out former positions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa3l9ai0ixf91.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a5645640005e657bfdb80c1f479199d1ec3418e\n\nThis is literally change. Given the market cap of BBBY of much less than a billion, even if they shorted the stock 10 times over, this would be nothing but change for several SHFs.\n\nSo no, shorts aren't being forced to close when their investment (short position) is still not remotely to being in danger after shorting it from 80$ down to 4$.\n\n\\-----\n\n2. Short interest isn't dropping\n\nIf you have a short squeeze, short interest will drop dramatically. So since we don't have data from today, let's take the data from 07.07.2022, a day where we had more than 60 million volume and a price rise similar to today. That's a comparable data point to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3prinjnixf91.png?width=904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c88c49487309cb4607fe347a5055302c7599c2c\n\nShort interest rose in that period, which doesn't indicate closing the short position (read: being squeezed), but looks like pre-mature FTD covering or netting of positions (CNS) or being exposed to Swaps - it surely wasn't the news of an insider buying a few shares (laughs at media). But those topics aren't to be discussed today.\n\nSo this is not a fucking short squeeze.\n\nBut wait, could today ignite the short squeeze for next week due to delta hedging ending in a gamma squeeze? For the sake of it lets pretend everyone is exercising their calls, which is near impossible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/svj0hockjxf91.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=651a01d6eafdfc3357f4be20ada1a03883682b91\n\nThat's what...quick maff... 35000 calls ITM? That's 3.5 million shares if ALL OF THEM WERE EXECUTED. Which is not happening. Never.\n\nThere hasn't been a single day where volume was lower than that in months. Average volume in a week is usually between 30-150 million.\n\nSurely 3.5 million shares would blow up a short hedge fund with an ITM position. A hedged position. With a friendly market maker.\n\nSo no, this is not a fucking short squeeze YET. You aren't squeezing anything but your left nut.\n\nStop running around screaming ridiculous price targets for next week.\n\n**My educated guess: we are seeing settlement (CNS or FTDs) from settlement cycles we have been seeing in the past years on the meme stock baskets. The current run-ups are not in-sync between the stocks, so I am assuming someone needs to let steam off the (volatility) swap pressure to avoid the price exploding during OPEX settlement.**\n\n**TLDR: You guys are absolutely retarded to think you are squeezing anyone out of their position. There is a good set-up for a mispriced retailer that is being valued as bankrupt. Ride this wave, do a x2, x3, x4 or just yolo into 0DTE (not now, retard) or ATM Leaps. We are currently seeing settlement (CNS or FTDs) or/and a valve of volatility swap pressure.**\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.",

    "selftext": "I asked myself this question before buying in. What makes a brand come out of bad financial situation that is close to bankruptcy.\n\nOther than the reasons this stock is being hyped for, like RC is in it, or it's shorted 101% or 46%, or getting a new CEO. A main aspect is often overlooked, it is FREE MARKETING!!!!\n\nYesterday lots of people didn't know BBBY existed or never bought from it before.\n\nToday after it got some traction here, lots of people are mentioning in their posts that they've bought the 29$ annual subscription from BBBY and they're buying items from their shops.\n\nFree marketing and brand awareness cost billions of dollars. Next time when you need an item sold by BBBY, you're gonna choose them over their competitors, especially that they have a bigger variety in of items in their niche.\n\nSo regardless if the short squeeze happened or not, the stock will grow organically as more people are aware of the brand.\n\nThat's just my 2\u00a2 on it!\n\nTLDR; \nBrand awareness and free marketing will revive the business and drive sales up organically.",

    "selftext": "Honestly, I don't get it. The business model is attracitve, but nothing can support 30%+ gain in a day. I like it since I bougt a car via Carvana before. When share was down to $29, I thought it is cheap enough, so I bought 1000 shares, but soon after it was down to 19 something. So I cut lose of 500 shares. Now it is over 40 becuase of a so-so earning report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cylogktt3xf91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ff10f7151d14a904cd649667faa0ae76d8de88\n\nCould this be new GME? I doubt it. The Astec socre is just 5 right now, which is far from triggering a short squeez. But somehow people is buying it crazy. Yes, 300+ a share for a online car dealer is absolutely a BS, but really 20 bucks? That is also not right as well. For that I see a potenial profit. Just not realizing it will be this fast.\n\nMy DCF model predict the price of CVNA should around 40 bucks a share by year end. This is considering the used car market is not going to cool off for next 6 to 12 month, thus higher EBITA exit multiple. Eventhough the price surge had cooling off, but price still remains high.\n\n[US CPI Cat, Used Cars and Trucks.

And most importantly you all seem to have had the \"humor\" part of the brain drilled out of your fucking skulls because you think you're waging economic jihad against the forces of Satan and **every. single. comment or post** you make just drags the fucking vibe down talking about how absolutely deadly serious it is that your broker hasn't tucked your diaper in the right way when filling your latest buy order.\n\nThis subreddit actually used to be kind of fun! And now half the time it isn't because it's just spammed by different apes fighting each other or fighting everybody else instead of posting gain or loss porn.

So, my calculations are probably inaccurate, but I hope they approximate the exact values.\n\n\nGME\n\nGME is listed on NYSE since 1996, it reached its lowest value on the 3rd of April, in 2020, having a price of $0.70 and it reached its highest value on the 27nth of January, in 2021, having a value of $86.88. Its current price is $40.02, and based on the companiesmarketcap.com, its market cap is $12.18 billions and its earnings are -$0.49 billions. Based on these, I found the following calculations;\n\nOutstanding shares = 304,347,826\nEPS = -1.61\nPE ratio = -24.85\n\n\nAMC\n\nAMC is listed on NYSE since 2014, its lowest price was $1.98 on 5th of January, in 2021, and its highest price was $62.55 on 2nd of June, also in 2021. Its present price is $22.18, it has a market cap of $$11.38 billions and its earnings are -$0.66 billions, based on the site mentioned above.

The float is 500k right now with almost the entirety of the shares locked up by institutions, it has 2.8 million shares short with 1000% ctb and an earnings report soon. even minimal volume this can trend the same way gamestop did in the beginning. Another redditor wrote this up, courtesy jsmith108. \n\n\n\n\"What makes the GETY gamma squeeze situation unique\n\n500K float is one thing. A lot of stocks have floats like that. The insane short interest  - 2 million or whatever - even that is not unheard of.\n\nWhat makes this truly unique is the call option contracts coupled with the small float. Retail can spend $3,000 on 100 shares or $3,000 on six $30 call options that cause the option writing funds to buy 600 shares as soon as the contracts go ITM.\n\nThere are over 6,000 August call option contracts that are ITM according to Yahoo from strikes ranging from $2.50-$30. That alone is over 600K shares locked in hedge. That doesn't consider the volume on each strike today, the fact that the $35 strikes and likely $40 strikes are going ITM tomorrow and the open interest on the September to February options.\n\nGamma squeeze indeed. This is GME on steroids.\"\n\n\nIs there a reason this is not trending here? Its well over the market cap of 500m and seems like a prime candidate atm.",

    "title": "Besides Those Mad Dog Type Option Trading, How to Build Up Your Wealth?",
    "selftext": "Some updates, lots of losers said I should fuck off and post it somewhere else. Well if you don\u2019t like it, deal with it. This post is perfectly good fit in here. My largest gain, is from MeMe shares. Never saying you should not buy those stocks, but need to control your risk exposure. I believe people are still try to make money here, not to throw them away (If that is your intention, please pm me so I can be part of your money giveaway). I am just sharing another way besides gambling with options. As long as it makes money, why the fuck you care how it\u2019s been done?  \n\n\n[Suck it up](https://preview.redd.it/juu8hwh2b4g91.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71ececbfd39d4056fc53d44807e834094a992ea9)\n\nI been watching WSB for a while, I did notice that there are quite a few try to beat the market by investing some heavy risky derivatives, i.e., naked call/put option. If you are a professional trader, ignore what I say. But if you are just into the market and try to gain some money, here is a right way to do it.\n\n**For start, you should avoid any short-term action**, which by IRS, any position hold for less than a year. Not because some BS around, simply for tax advantages. Any assets hold less than a year is subject to ordinary income tax rate which in general, MUCH higher than long term capital gain. You don't want IRS to take a cut of profit for no reason, right?\n\n**Secondly, do not timing the market.** If there is one thing I learn from the past 5 years of trading, nobody knows how market could do tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or next week, next month, or next year. This has been proven over and over. But people just don't believe it. They created graphs, lines, chats, all kind of \"Voodoo\" try to predict a short-term market. But so far, we haven't heard anyone who become super rich by timing or predict it.\n\nBut people still doing it anyway, just like those historical numbers on roulette, you know mathematically previous results has absolutely nothing to do with current results, but we just try to connect the dots, and still enjoy it even though it is a BS.\n\nI do it as well, it is human nature. But if you want to make money, you have against it. In 2013, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences was awarded jointly to Eugene F. Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert J. Shiller for proven that short term market movement is not predictible in short, it is ramdon movement (actually it is Geometric Brownian motion, but we don't need that much details). Which kind of officially announced everything is BS in financial market. However, for long time prediction, it could be very accurate. That is why when you are seeking advise from any kind of finical advisor (As long as they are licensed), they will recommend you invest at least for 3 years.\n\nHere is a list of long holing stocks I have since 2017, you can see since time elapse, the only factor to determine a stock price is it cash flow. Which is how the price of stock is valuated. The price of stock represents company future cash flow discounted to current dollar value.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7a1wnc3l0g91.png?width=2702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e87a513029e1c7f8ea2ff7d9880e2a52b80117e1\n\nSo, our job is simple. When market is in panic mode, assets won\u2019t price correctly. Companies with solid fundamentals, will trade less than what it worth. We buy in and hold until the fair value is presented. Sell only if you need money for vacation, buy a car, a house or support child for school, or the fundamental of a company has changed.\n\nIn finance, people use Discount Cash Flow  model to calculate a company future cash flow discounted to current value. The calculation is complex, and there are lots of parameter input is by human guessing. That is why you need to invest in multiple companies to increase you chance of success. Which leads to my third point: unless you have non-public information from a reliable source, such as our house of speaker Nancy Pelosi, or company\u2019s C level executives, which then you are subject violation of insider trading; **you should never put more than 10% of your entire portfolio into one single assets.**\n\nYes, people paste lots of attractive screen shots by gambling solely on GME, AMC, BBYC, etc. But the thing for gambling, is that the overall expectation is not in your favor. There is always lucky winner for each draw, but most likely will not be you. Since you are not kissed by God, investing in multiple assets is your only way to make money in a constant pace, which means portfolio diversification.\n\nBut to manage a portfolio is expansive and time consuming. It feels like working on a 2nd job. You basically acting as a fund manager, reading research reports, following news, trace macro economy and all kind of data, even with all that, sometimes still got fucked by the market.\n\nLucky, for every demand there is a service. We can investing in mutual fund or simply ETFs to achieve similar results by paying a small portion of fees. Which is I recommended most people to do. My self for example, have 60% of positions on varieties of mutual funds or ETFs. I know my limitation, I am good at value those high-tech firm, since this is the area that I work for almost 10 years, I know the future of the industry, better than those analysts. So do this part by myself. The area that I am not so familiar with, such as traditional industries, energy, and etc, I buy funds that will covers it. Together, these assets create a Fund of Funds, which basically covers all good companies across the globe. This strategy went well so far. Average annual return for the past 5 years is around 18%.\n\nThis way has been proven that will work. by throwing everything into a Monte Carlo (commonly used in assets return prejection for a LONG period of time). My portfolio return is granteed. Althought leaglly fund manger can't promiss you anything, but for sure, long lasting funds will genertate lots of money in a long period of time.\n\nHowever, no body like to be rich slowly.  You must give your money time to grow. It will pay you back in time.",

To be clear, this is not a \"forget $GME/$AMC/$BBBY, try growing beetroot\" post from Yahoo Finance. This is an observation from multiple meme stock spikes over the last two years. Therefore, due to completely anecdotal evidence that is backed by zero technical research, I believe $COIN will go north of $120 in the next two weeks. The reason for this is based around the rise of alternate currencies during the same periods as the previous spikes and the recent decline of various coin prices followed by a surprising reversal and trend upwards.

    "selftext": "There's lots of talk about the issuance of APE to immediately dilute AMC stock. This is not how dilution works.\n\n*B-b-but more shares price go down means dilute!*\n\nThis is not what defines dilution, so unless you want to start redefining words, let's get to what dilution really means. In order to dilute a stock, you need to reduce the % ownership of a holder who does absolutely nothing but hold. If you have 10mil shares of AMC you own roughly 2% of the company. If you bought those 10mil on March 10th, 2021, you owned 11.7% of the entire fucking company. On March 11th, your ownership dropped to 2.2% ... Yes, you read that right. In one day, you woke up to seeing your ownership of an entire multi-billion dollar company go from 11.7% to 2.2%! That's some serious dilution. It would go on to dilute a tiny bit more over the next 5 months, like drop your 2.2% to 2.0%-ish.\n\nRelax, Adam Aron said this *good dilution.* [There's good dilution and there's bad dilution.](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555949799362396160?s=20&amp;t=3Q24Fd9JGUnXbRm_SEWdEw) This historically has allowed AA to cash out of ALL of his AMC position that he was legally allowed to sell (retirement is difficult to prepare for, amirite?) AND raise funds for the company, this is good. Don't worry about your own ~~bags~~ portfolio, that's not part of what makes dilution good or bad. Let's focus on the ~~execs~~ company, because without the company, you shareholders are worthless.\n\nOkay, so [AA is technically correct](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555959338442919939?s=20&amp;t=3Q24Fd9JGUnXbRm_SEWdEw), this initial APE ticker going live August ~~19rd~~ 19st* is not dilution. But wait, what's this about [offering more APE?](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555959339487313922?s=20&amp;t=3Q24Fd9JGUnXbRm_SEWdEw) Ahhh, here's where we get dilution. How many we talkin here, equivalent of ~~dumping~~ selling another 50mil shares?\n\nWait, what? 4,500,000,000 additional? That's what an upcoming vote will be about, the real dilution. They cannot dilute this without a vote. The entire reasoning behind APE is to trick shareholders into voting for dilution via APE since diluting via AMC didn't work (voted NO already).\n\nPosition: never bought a single option or share of AMC in my life. 70% of my portfolio is in GME and 20% is in BBBY.\n\nEdit: ew linking AA tweets gave this a god-awful Bruce Lee AA pic...",

I am a 34 year old with 11k lurking for the last week, also majorly regarded and getting a little sense (not enough) of what is sus around here but like a muscle I need to exercise my sus detection. I can make everything back that I have by working for 1-2 months if I lose it all so that's not a big as long as can afford food, gas, gym, and rent in real time by working. So actually ending up with $0 is great cuz it means I tried. So I want to bet 10k of the 11k at the right time on the right thing, and how much can I end up with if i bet right?  1 million? I want to bet WSB the right way so next time there is a major thing i want to be on the train like with GME back in the panny. I wonder if I sound regarded to everyone. To me I sound regarded as read back what i wrote. But anyway and important regarded question is for real bruh i cannot read 15,000 messages per sub-redit on WSB, it's too much for anyone to read everything. How do i know what is real and where to focus my reading energy? Maybe I am doing things wrong. Maybe I am too old for Reddit so it doesn't come naturally to me. Oh, and before I forget, fuck you.

    "title": "Breaking Down The Ape Dividend",
    "selftext": "This is the first time I've written here but I feel it's important enough to bring awareness to how this dividend will be handled. I'm by no means an expert on anything. My wife's boyfriend had to read the documents to me, but if you'd like a background, I've written a few pieces of DD elsewhere including breaking down the Credit Suisse report last year. Anyways, not financial advice. I'm not here to tell you whether you should be in anything or not, that's fully your choice. I'm merely going to interpret the data as given.\n\nLet's start with the announcement:\n\n[https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2022/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-AMC-Preferred-Equity-Units/default.aspx)\n\nThere is A LOT to unpack here, but I'm going word for word in their official documentation and will try to break it down in finer detail.\n\n*LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (the \u201cCompany,\u201d or \u201cAMC\u201d), announced today that it has declared a special dividend of one AMC Preferred Equity unit (an \u201cAMC Preferred Equity Unit\u201d) for each share of AMC Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 2022. The special dividend is expected to be paid at the close of business on August 19, 2022.*\n\n*The Company has applied to list its AMC Preferred Equity Units on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the symbol \u201cAPE\u201d starting August 22, 2022 and each AMC Preferred Equity Unit is designed to have the same economic and voting rights as one share of Common Stock.*\n\n*The AMC Preferred Equity Units can convert into Common Stock, but only if the Company proposes and investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, in an amount at least sufficient to permit the conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock (through a \u201cCommon Stock Amendment\u201d).*\n\n*Regarding the dividend, Adam Aron, AMC Entertainment Chairman and CEO commented, \u201cToday we are rewarding and recognizing our passionate and supportive shareholders, both to our shareholders in the U.S. and internationally, with a dividend of AMC Preferred Equity units that will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol APE. Shareholders will receive one AMC Preferred Equity unit for each company issued share of AMC common stock that they own. This means that based on our 516,820,595 shares outstanding, we will be issuing a dividend of 516,820,595 AMC Preferred Equity units.\u201d*\n\nSo this the first part telling you how it's going to happen. A new ticker will be created August 22, $APE with a total number of 516,820,595 \"units.\" While it isn't common stock in the parent company (AMC), it shares the same economic and voting rights as one share of Common Stock. What does this mean? It means that if you have 1 AMC and 1 APE, you now hold 2 shares worth of voting power in corporate actions. It also means that August 22, AMC and APE are going to start off with a shared a market cap.\n\n**EXAMPLE**\n\nAugust 21, AMC closes at $22.00.\n\nAugust 22, AMC opens at $11 and APE opens at $11\n\nSame market cap, split in half between two tickers. Don't take my word for it though, Adam Aron went on a FUD cleaning spree earlier. Let's see what he says: [https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555946487384866817](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1555946487384866817)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vej8gulrv6g91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f14c77f0777e8db72a0ac6dd1e0e940c067cc0a\n\nYou're being given 1 APE share for 1 AMC share and then the stock price of AMC drops in half the following day. In other words, a stock split via 2 tickers. Remember APE and AMC both have the same economic and voting power in corporate actions. It's not really a dilution if you redefine it right? Thanks for that lesson J-Pow and co...\n\nI can already hear the screeches... \"BuT tHeY'Re OnLy GiVeN To ShArEhOlDeRs.\" Bless your heart, let me take you down a side track real quick. DRS over in that sub is relatively hit and miss. While there is no official count, as is the case in GME when they include DRS numbers in quarterly reports, let's say 25% is directly registered with the remainder being held in broker accounts. Got some bad news for you, if only 25% is directly registered, that leaves 75% registered in \"street name\" whether they are bought or not. The name of the DTC Nominee is CeDe and Co. So while they're technically correct, and only given to shareholders, the full number is still distributed. All 514,000,00 of them. Don't take my word for it here either tho.\n\n[https://www.computershare.com/us/becoming-a-registered-shareholder-in-us-listed-companies](https://www.computershare.com/us/becoming-a-registered-shareholder-in-us-listed-companies)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsoaw91tv6g91.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=812d9d6b66c84550a60e0788ff15755c0d52b97a\n\nWhatever you choose to call it, there is the first dilution since your AMC shares start at half price on August 22. Here's the kicker, you as the shareholders will have to approve the amendment to dilute next year in order to redeem your 1 APE for 1 AMC.\n\n*The AMC Preferred Equity Units can convert into Common Stock, but only if the Company proposes and investors vote to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, in an amount at least sufficient to permit the conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock (through a \u201cCommon Stock Amendment\u201d).*\n\n*If the Common Stock Amendment is adopted by shareholders, each AMC Preferred Equity Unit will convert into one share of Common Stock and such Common Stock will be distributed upon conversion to holders of AMC Preferred Equity Units on a one-to-one basis (one share of Common Stock for each AMC Preferred Equity Unit held).*\n\nThere is your second dilution. If the majority of APE is still in CeDe and Co, there is enough voting power to approve the dilution next year. Invest in what you want, but DRS your shit. This is my last attempt at bringing data to the ultra smooth.\n\nPeace\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit\\* Bonus round on why investors will have no recourse is found in their registration agreement with Wand back in 2013: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746915001918/a2223294zex-10\\_17.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746915001918/a2223294zex-10_17.htm)",

    "title": "Want to know why Hedge Funds Are Petrified Of BBBY &amp; GME Investors?",
    "selftext": "Before I start, I will disclose my position: **2000 BBBY shares and 900 GME shares**. Yes this is my entire life savings. I'm not a rich man or a whale. I have no retirement account. No 401k account. No IRA. No emergency fund. No money in my checking account. My credit cards are maxed out.\n\nI was introduced to investing through WSB. The first 4 stocks I bought ever in my life were bought on February 2nd 2021 because of WSB. Those stocks were Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and Gamestop or BANG for short. What I've noticed since then is that the mainstream media has produced hit-piece after hit-piece against retail investors.  \n\nWhy? Why should super rich and powerful hedge fund billionaire owners be scared of poor retail investors like me? Why presumably pay millions to news media so that they keep writing negative news articles about GME and BBBY? Keep telling people not to invest in those companies? If those companies are so awful and dying anyway, what does it matter if people invest in those companies or not?\n\nTruth is, hedge funds are petrified of GME/BBBY investors because they're irrational. **Irrational to the extreme.** See, most investors are paper hands. If the share price starts falling, they sell for a loss and move on. Most investors get upset and scared when the share price falls. GME/BBBY investors get happy when the share price falls because they think of it as a discount, a sale on the shares! What scares other people, brings a smile to their faces!\n\nHow can you fight such people? How can you force them to sell their shares? You can't! You simply can't! What's happening now isn't a coincidence. It isn't just a fluke! GME and BBBY share price rising, the GME TA indicating that a Golden Cross is occurring. All this indicates that hedge funds are slowly giving up their battle. That both GME and BBBY reaching triple digits in the next 4 months is very much possible.\n\nAny of you watched the 2014 movie **Dracula Untold** with Luke Evans and Charles Dance? In this movie, the Sultan of Turkey, orders Vlad I, ruler of Transylvania, to send a 1000 Transylvanian boys to Turkey. So that those boys could be trained to be janissaries (warriors) and fight for Turkey. Vlad of course, doesn't wish to do this but also cannot easily refuse the much more powerful Sultan.\n\nVlad instead goes to a certain cave located high up in the Carpathian mountains. A cave inhabited by an very old &amp; powerful monster, a vampire. Vlad enters the cave and is immediately cornered by the vampire. The vampire then says **\"Everyone who is caught by me reeks of fear and yet in you, I smell hope. Why do you enter my cave and become hopeful when you see me?\"** Vlad responds that he has come to become a vampire so he will have the power to destroy the Turkish army. Vlad is then turned into a vampire and he indeed destroys the Turks and saves his people.\n\nGME &amp; BBBY investors are Vlad. Where others feel fear, we feel hope. When the share price goes down, we smile and buy more shares. There's simply no defeating that attitude.",

    "selftext": "Alright you fellow rehtards, I just want everyone to know that this is just day 1.\n\nWe aren\u2019t middle aged dads that are going to get pushed out of our positions to fund some child\u2019s education. No- we are going hold until we can send those children to wherever the fuck they want to go in a new lambo. Or yolo into GME if kids are too expensive in November when the BBBY squeeze is done.\n\nA quick look at the option chain tells a quick story that everyone is expecting more, much more, $80 more. [Cohen\u2019s Option chain abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjdpgh/bbby_look_at_this_jacked_option_chain/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[GME squeeze day 1](https://imgur.com/a/H1vZAjL)\nHere is an image back in January 2021 day 1 of the GME golden age. Same price action as BBBY today. (Look at Jan 25 before your blind ass comments)\n\nMy positions: \n650 shares at 7.66,\n45 $80c Jan 2023\n\nDon\u2019t listen to the fake media and fake posts getting 30 awards in the first 5 minutes. We don\u2019t loosen our grip on their nuts while they squak and scramble funds before being margin called. Today was just the first taste while they determine to close their shorts or wait out the storm. Tomorrow we go higher.\n\n\n\nI just hope this sees enough so we don\u2019t start fuckin panic selling. But not enough so some other reitard positions and bans me forcing me to do more fucking work on this subreddit.",

    "selftext": " Hey guys, if you have not seen my Yolo post, here is a shot of the position at the time \u2026.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6bx6d3rm2fg91.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3d24bf0a0bd8446e2a29b44a9c7bc945165041)\n\n...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  \n\n\nMy Thesis on this Play is as follows -  \nI have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..\n\n  \nAfter the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.\n\n  \n\u2026Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it\u2019s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- \u201cBuy Buy Baby\u201d. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.\n\n  \nWith GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC\u2019s cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478d80696050b72babda6908d275b968acd075ca)\n\n  \nAs GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  \nThat said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.\n\n  \nAgain, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I\u2019m glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.\n\n  \nSo again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of \u201cmeme basket\u201d and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.\n\n  \nSo back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME\u2019s stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.\n\n  \nI waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time\u2026 either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.\n\n  \nAs things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  \nThen last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279)\n\n  \nAfter watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post\u2026 I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)\u2026.  \nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.\n\n  \nThe stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  \nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  \nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.\n\n  \nThursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.\n\n  \nFriday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  \nSo yeah\u2026 I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  \nAgain, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of \u201cMOASS\u201d like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.\n\n  \nAs one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  \n It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.\n\n  \nIn closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).\n\n  \nFor anyone interested in the statistics on short interest end all around holdings I would urge you to check out - w w w. byebyeshorts . c o m\n\n  \nIn regards to the Yolo\u2026\n\n  \nI Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, &amp; the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.  \nI decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why\u2026.  \nMuch love everyone!

    "title": "BBBY- The Do-Or-Die Moment for Short Sellers on 8/8 and 8/9 (DD)",
    "selftext": "I had been working on some DD prior to the initialization of the squeeze, but didn\u2019t finish it in time, and there\u2019s a lot of good DD out there already. I\u2019m going to focus on what\u2019s happening right now (8/9, BBBY down \\~20% and what it means).\n\n**TL:DR;** $BBBY has a lot of underwater short interest that is actively working against a squeeze. Today was a do-or-die moment.\n\n**Positions:** 11K shares at about $7. Took profits along the way, but I\u2019m holding what I have left to see what happens.\n\n## Shares, Ownership &amp; Short Interest\n\nBBBY has been buying back shares for the last few years (terrible capital allocation imo, but that\u2019s water under the bridge) and is now down to **79M shares outstanding from 186M in 2015:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olsk42b65qg91.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae9337fa823a6d3a0c2661bda05316a4a6f238b5\n\nCurrently, institutions and strategic entities are long **84M shares** out of **79M outstanding** \\- yes, they are long more than 100% of issued shares. We\u2019re not even talking about float here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9shqtnw75qg91.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363edeb45e8cfcf1e6cff1ba8ba166e0749ce708\n\nAs you can see from the blue line in the first chart above, there was one large short cover during the squeeze in Jan 2021, but since then, the short interest has been mostly flat up until July of this year at about 20M shares - despite the buybacks.\n\nThat\u2019s from quarterly short interest reporting. Now, S3 reports that **10M shares were shorted below $7**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo7mhoad5qg91.png?width=835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66cc9dacca854c0a0f7e6fd13f121329d3d5e490\n\nThe short thesis here, again, is bankruptcy. Admittedly, this is not an impossibility, though the higher the share price goes the less likely (given the potential to do share offerings to raise capital).\n\nSo, nutso summary here:\n\n* **80M shares issued**\n* **85M shares owned by institutions and funds**\n* **30M+ shares short, with 10M shorted below $7**\n\n## Price action on 8/8 after hours on 8/9\n\nI was pretty attuned to the GME squeeze in 2021 having written a lot of posts as part of my EndGame series. I\u2019m seeing many similarities in behaviors. Here are some notes:\n\n* Shorts tended to defend the price level of 2x their entry. For GME, this was $15.8, which was defended hard a few times, and when that level was lost it was squeezetown. $15.8 represented **2x the entry price of a large quantity of shorts.** Why is this significant? At 2x the price, your short is now at **-100% and it\u2019s very likely your risk mgmt group is going to shut you down.**\n* BBBY started going on 8/8 and in particular after hours. Why did we have a 16% spike after hours? **That started at $12.** **My hypothesis is that there were a group of shorts that entered at $6 and began to get force closed at -100%.**\n* Premarket at 8/9 was sitting at **$13+**. If the market opened bbby at $13+, there would have been a slew of force closures from smaller and potentially larger short entities as that would represent -100% for larger and larger portions of the 10M short shares added under $7. **It was critical for shorts to move the price down. Do or die at $13.**\n\n## So it's do-or-die, what do shorts do?\n\n* Selling during low volume premarket to establish downward trend\n* Shorting via synthetic shorts (short calls / long puts)\n* Analyst downgrades\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snvpahsh5qg91.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba2111b9a9b32a6f2d5ee0cd540325aedc2a148\n\n* Potential astroturfing in WSB (low karma, low post history accounts sharing negative sentiment in daily thread)\n   * A decent amount of algos follow sentiment in retail, and in addition to shorting you can astroturf social media investing sites to change sentiment\n* Once BBBY hits -10%, they can\u2019t short on the bid, so they establish sell walls to keep the price below ask (examples):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37lifq8l5qg91.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d24eb24f35033e1eae45703a253cdd71e4ba5eb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05gaejgo5qg91.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4126d9fe8c91366f36a8405f4a1ba80dc6e43ebd\n\nAdditionally, today marked the opening of a slew of strikes upward, **which is generally bearish b/c a bunch of retards tend to buy the highest strike, leading to negative pressure on the underlying when MMs later dehedge those positions.**\n\n## Where does that bring BBBY today?\n\n1. Shorts have won the day, turning momentum around with a massive reversal from 13+ to $9 currently\n2. However, they\u2019re still sitting on 30M shorts, and probably more after today, with 10M+ entered below $7/share. So far, this hasn\u2019t undone the beginning of this squeeze:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sosc4oq5qg91.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9a5b5011e344ec6b9aa557df23d3387817b49f2\n\nFinally, short shares availability is quite low - **so there's no evidence that shorts have actually covered at all during the 5-day rally.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Blue bars: short shares available. Red line is short borrow fee. ](https://preview.redd.it/uz4iys386qg91.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=524f21743a2735c778e44188acc1800f40be70fe)\n\n## So what now?\n\nThe long game: The short thesis is bankruptcy for $BBBY. If $BBBY can avoid bankruptcy, the short thesis is squashed and they\u2019ll need to exit. This may not be today, tomorrow, or next month - but that\u2019s the long game. Personally, I\u2019m betting $BBBY finds a way to squash bankruptcy risk which will push this to a long struggle to get out for shorts.\n\nThe short game: It\u2019s generally looking like retail is giving up the short game in the face of many strong short-seller tactics.\n\nIn my opinion, buying OTM calls just helps move the price down as MMs de-hedge, while shares reduce the pool of people that shorts can buy back from.\n\n## UPDATE: OH SHIT.\n\n## Just realized. BBBY short interest might be updating EOD TODAY! If that's true, that's another reason for the push down today.\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest#:\\~:text=All%20short%20interest%20positions%20must,settlement%20date%20designated%20by%20FINRA](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest#:~:text=All%20short%20interest%20positions%20must,settlement%20date%20designated%20by%20FINRA).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zp3pazgerqg91.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd311dc71f1ed2b0f9e542382979200b6079ce48\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlle43jdrqg91.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c25a2e12dc3824a2117c0e43d39b666de745a684\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## 8/9 SHORT INTEREST UPDATE \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Between 6/30 and 7/15, **Shorts added 7M shares short of $BBBY**\n* Between 7/15 and 7/29, **Shorts added 500K shares short of $BBBY**\n* Current official short interest as of 7/29 is **29M shares** [per Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest)\n* Unofficial ORTEX estimate is at **52M shares short**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3qdr3w44rg91.png?width=1062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15e333cd503312b92384d72c48e58bca1e162a14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8l3d4514rg91.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef46ec90a88bae180f4191ef2b5b6fc6723d644c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why is that significant?** \n\nLet\u2019s look at [BBBY\u2019s price between 6/30 and 7/15](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1656547200&amp;period2=1657843200&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtlaxv274rg91.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c86cdcafc1bbe3da6e860f6aef081f8c50de7bb2\n\n \n\n**That\u2019s an average close price of $4.9.**\n\n**7M shorts were added to BBBY\u2019s short basket at an average price of $4.9.** \n\nBBBY is currently at $10 after hours. **7M shorts are sitting on over 100% loss.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4bv8sub4rg91.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09671f8cb013cbf29b2845fe233428de8687e6dd\n\nKeep in mind in my previous post I shared that I don\u2019t see any evidence of covering. \n\nNow, let\u2019s look at [BBBY\u2019s price between 7/15 and 7/29](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1657843200&amp;period2=1659312000&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i3p4jxe84rg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cfae153a8f11ef2b7e993c2a8edf1fe5a7f1cf4\n\n \n\n**That\u2019s an average close price of $5.08.**\n\n**500K shorts were added to BBBY\u2019s short basket at an average price of $4.9.** \n\n## Summary: Shorts R Still Fuk\n\nSo, **7.5M shares were added in a month at an average price of $5,** there\u2019s **no evidence of covering,** and **they\u2019re sitting on a 100% loss at current prices.** \n\nYeah, I\u2019m going to see how this all plays out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've made at least $140 loss so far and once I hit $200 loss I think I'll just call it a day and cash out to avoid losing everything. \n\nCan anyone with a real brain give me some advice on how long it will take before I start making profit and if there's anything I should be doing in the meantime?",

    "selftext": "Arguably the hottest post on WSB today -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wkzd91/why\\_you\\_shouldnt\\_take\\_out\\_a\\_27k\\_loan\\_to\\_buy\\_stocks/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&amp;utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wkzd91/why_you_shouldnt_take_out_a_27k_loan_to_buy_stocks/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) by user u/iFuckTinderFatties is a bit sus to say the least.\n\nThis user joined reddit may 30th, 2022, just over two months ago. Yet here he claims to have caught the top of the GME sneeze-\n\n\" In early 2021 I managed to turn my car money that my parents gave me ($15,000) into over $360,000 on GME. I was luck to sell around $370 and timed the top almost perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately I managed to lose all my gains and then some, 350k, in the next several months on SPACs and penny stocks.\"\n\nSo he just joined but somehow managed to capitalize on GME before the run up/before it was mainstream 1.5 years earlier? Unlikely\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nIn this post he claims that his average on BBBY is [2631@10.26](mailto:2631@10.26). Yet his money from this loan got \"deposited\" to his account Friday the 5th when the high was $8.30, inclusive of after hours. BBBY opened at 10.93 monday the 8th. Thus having a 10.23 average is somewhat unlikely. The only window he could have bought for a 10.23 average on monday the 8th is specifically between 6.57am to 7:07am in the premarket. A pretty narrow window... but plausible, still, if he was that horny to buy on monday, why didn't he just buy on Friday?\n\nHe also said this at 530pm yesterday-\n\n\"Who else held BBBY today through this dip?\n\nI\u2019m not selling!!! Did my dd, I\u2019m confident in my position\"\n\nAt the time of that post BBBY was trading for 10.29...He would have been green? Despite that post, he claims to have sold at an 8.3% loss which would equate to 9.38/share. Less than a dollar down, a weird place to set a stop loss in a stock you are so confident in.\n\n\\---------------\n\nLastly, if you go through his post history it's pretty spammy but mostly filled with nonsense and a confusing timeline of when he claimed to have just fucked a milf, yet days later is talking about his GF, then threatening his GF cause she didn't want to have sex, then breaking up with his GF.\n\nSo best case, don't feel bad for judging him because he is a shit human. Medium case he is a perpetual liar. Worst case (which I'm leaning towards) he is a shill.\n\nAnyway point is; other people smarter than me should dig into further. Also don't trust everything you read on the internet. If mods want to take down this post that's fine, just wanted to bring it to your attention that it suspicious as fuck.",

    "selftext": "Got absolutely smoked yesterday. The second photo was my daily P/L at the peak of the downturn. I did buy some outs when I realized it was going to plummet, however, they were not very profitable. Loaded some more calls when the SP was in the 8\u2019s. 8c\u2019s - 15c\u2019s each strike on the dollar, and dating to 8/26. Those calls salvaged a bit of daily P/L, but that play wasn\u2019t about yesterday. I took advantage of the dip, and I believe that the reward probability heavily outweighs the risk probability &amp; am excited for the next few weeks. \n\nI did not have the grasp on the derivatives market, or the experience that I do now, last January during the great GME run of 21, however the prospect of being able to navigate a subsequent run has extremely fascinated me. \n\nMy plan moving forward is to continue to play the daily volatility both ways, while continuing to add shares to my overall equity position. I will continue to buy primarily In The Money, but also look to capitalize on days with bullish momentum with ATM, near and reasonably OTM calls that I anticipate will run ITM, and exercising my lowest strike with premium from all remaining premium. This will allow me to build my equity position &amp; retain gains, while limiting the bulk of my capital\u2019s exposure to negative volatility &amp; theta (time decay, retard). \n\n3 things - \n\n1. From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank everyone who has reached out with kind words of encouragement. Executing this play (while originally planning to execute the strategy via GME only) has consumed so much of me over the past two years. The amount of time and dedication I have devoted to tracking an analyzing data is almost as mind bending as the amount of money I initially lost while learning to trade with (against) the big boys. Make no mistake, I have been smoked, scorched and vaporized of the face of the planet, multiple times. I totally Blew up multiple margin accounts before I made my first dollar from derivatives. \n\n\n2. The success that I have been fortunate enough to experience can be attributed to perseverance, dedication, education, tenacity, patience, discipline, experience, and most of all, *lack of emotion while trading*.  \n\n3. Please be kind to one and other. I am all for trolling, absurdities, debauchery, gain and loss porn, but there is no reason to be maliciously unkind to one another. Especially someone seeking advice, or someone who has just lost a shit ton of money.\n\n******None of this is financial advice- as has been stated before, I am literally a retarded person. My wife\u2019s boyfriend is starting to allow me to eat at the table, and even let me borrow my car from him yesterday! *****\n\nLETS GO, RETARDS!",

I also enjoyed some GME vibes around here. But since the real short-battle started there are way too many posts going around here invoking some kind of group responsibility or cult following and this is NOT what this is about.\n\nIf you want to go into BBBY because you believe in the investment case. Fine.\n\nIf you want to go into BBBY because you see the potential for a short squeeze. Fine.\n\nIf you go into BBBY because you have FOMO - fine.\n\nBut if you do - be an \ud83e\udd8d and get a grip.

[SEC - 10-Q (May 28, 2022)](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000886158/000088615822000081/bbby-20220528.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qziow0mlsg91.png?width=446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d223958e8dbecdb7d36234c7c91d6e134079417b\n\n9.4M shares + 1.67M shares if calls exercised = 11M shares.  11M shares / 79.9M shares outstanding) = 13%.  Basically, Ryan owns about 10% of BBBY and may acquire a total of 13% of BBBY.\n\nRyan Cohen is worth about $2.6B.  RC Ventures has about $500M under management.  I am not sure how on RC Ventures funds under management - if someone knows, please let me know.\n\nSo $126M investment in BBBY = 25% of RC Ventures funds under management and 5% of Ryan Cohen's net worth.\n\nBBBY has $5.1B in liabilities which $1.4B is long term debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgft3grulsg91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fc6591a3ca9ed9251512dbc3bd3bca23c6a469\n\n[SEC - 10-Q (May 28, 2022)](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000886158/000088615822000081/bbby-20220528.htm#i80bae96d8b02438285edf49f3c08234d_16)\n\nBasically, if BBBY sells or spins off Buy Buy Baby for \"several billion dollars,\" BBBY can payoff its debt (it's hard to go bankrupt with no debt) and get a new start.  How much is BBBY worth with little to no debt?  Ryan Cohen thinks way more than the current price.\n\nPositions - 200 shares in my individual account purchased at $5.10 per share with $2 puts as a hedge and 600 shares in my Roth IRA purchased at $4.85. with $2 puts as a hedge.\n\nAs most trades - you could lose it all.  It's up to you on how much you are willing to lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h823kd9wlsg91.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c03554c47b4f457a793be2c3f81cfdbae9392238\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ty35cm9wlsg91.jpg?width=1044&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d740b59e20722d777c9ce40b07dd165e38f32f3",

    "selftext": "This week was crazy, we had many ups and downs, but the thesis stays intact. BBBY has many problems - cash burn, mismanagement of inventories, inneficient marketing strategy, underdeveloped online selling channels etc. However, it is no wonder that Ryan Cohen acquired a large stake at prices way higher than today's. The company definitely has untapped potential and could prove to be a succes story in the long-term. They have physical assets that are valued at billions of dollars,  nationwide brand recognition and most importantly they have a separate brand(business) that  they own  that by itself could be worth more than the whole company.  \"Buy Baby\" by itself generated more than 1 billion in sales, with 50 percent of sales generated online. The high short interest and the meme investing craze started by GME  is just the cherry on top. \n\nHaving said that, I am well aware of the fact that gains might not come very soon and I am prepared to handle the volatility. A near term potential catalyst is the expected update at the end of August from the management about the company's current condition and the steps that have been taken for its restructuring. Nevertheless, as a European guy I am seeing a lot of retail investors from Europe having an interest in BBBY and I can assure you that a lot of us are ready to diamond hand our shares alongside our bros across the ocean.\n\nPS: Investing in a business like BBBY that is struggling to say the least is extremely risky and is not recommended for people who have moderate to low risk tolerance. Invest at your own risk. \n\nBBBY to the moon and beyond \ud83c\udf1a\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

    "selftext": "Guys I'm not sure how this is possible but this sub has become more regarded than ever before. I remember back in the day when this sub used to hype up actual good companies with a good future like TSLA and AMD. Then after the whole GME fiasco it's nothing but trying to squeeze shitty as companies.\n\nListen the whole reason the GME squeeze happened so effective in the first place is because a lot of people actually believed in GME. GME was very undervalued with another console cycle coming out and not to mention video games are just cool and you can imagine getting creative selling things in a store that sells them. Now it's BBBY? I'm gonna be honest with y'all. I got in last week, I got the bag and I dipped. I've seen multiple post of people saying that they don't believe in the company but they are just there for the squeeze. A squeeze will never work that way! In order for a squeeze to actually squeeze people have to legitimately believe in the future outlook of the company because at the end of the day someone needs to buy those shares higher than the last person that bought them and so on.\n\nWith that being said can I interest you in spreading the work about our lord and savior ASTS. This company is claiming to be able to link your phone directly to a satellite from anywhere in the world and give you service! That's right, you can keep checking your roobinhood accounts, watch porn, work from home from anywhere in the fucking world! They do this by making big ass fucking satellites the size of a basket ball court which unfold in space like the fucking web telescope. If this tech is as good as they say it is it legitimately has the chance to 10x in the next few years easy. They are launching a satellite in a spacex rocket in the next few weeks so soon we will see how well this tech really works.\n\nSome of the bear case for this stock:\n\nSatellite doesn't unfold properly cause delay of a year or more\n\nThe service may not be that great\n\nFCC regulations due to it possibly causing interference with planes and shit.\n\n\\---------------\n\nDue to the risky nature of this stock it has a decent amount of SI as well.\n\nImagine squeezing and actually good company that you wouldn't mind HODLing because it actually has a bright future!

    "title": "My BBBY Leap Frog Option Strategy",
    "selftext": "I posted a couple days ago about making $15k in a day with BBBY options and u/calebbooty9 asked \"How do you guys actually make money off options? I know how stupid I must sound but I\u2019m trying to get rich too \ud83d\ude29\"  \n\nMy initial reaction was to reply with that picture of Juan Joya Borja laughing hysterically.  \n\n['How do you guys actually make money off options' ](https://i.redd.it/nc6j8un0lfh91.gif)\n\nHowever, as time passed, I realized that the Juan Borja meme was getting a bit overpumped and that maybe I should detail how I was able to make some money with short-dated options.  So here we go... \n\nIt was Thursday morning (8/4/22) and I was browsing reddit while on my toilet forgetting the fact that I was already running a little late to work.  I saw a couple mentions of $BBBY and figured it was just another pump-and-dump getting shilled on the sub.  I took a break from options after the GME/AMC pumps back in March and April, so I was out of the loop.   Anyway, I had nothing else to look at so I took a peak at the chart.  It looked like BBBY had a good streak of green days and was just starting to pick up some major volume.  The options were relatively cheap and I figured that it would be a quick in and out play.  At market open, I purchased 50 of the $6.5 calls that were expiring the following Friday for $44 a piece (total of $2200).  BBBY broke about even that day and my calls were down.  However, I liked what I was reading about the upcoming squeeze so decided to hold over night. \n\nFriday morning came around and BBBY was climbing.  This is where my \"leap frog strategy\" actually begins.  My $6.5 call options nearly doubled overnight (they actually had MORE than doubled right at open, but dipped down a bit a few minutes into the session).  Whenever my options double in value, I try to sell half of my position to either ensure gains or that future purchases are at a discount.  So, in this case I sold 25 contracts for $75 a piece (total of $1875) and let the other half of my initial contracts ride.  Keep in mind, the volume was massive on 8/5 relative to the previous days and the price was pumping.  I figured if there was anytime to get deep into a position this would be it.  I  decided to purchase an additional 180 contracts of the $10 strike expiring on 8/12 for $19-25 a contract (total of $3800).  I figured that I had already made a little money from the $6.5 calls, so even if these dipped a bit I was buying them at a discount.  I now had 25 $6.5c 8/12 and 180 $10c 8/12.\n\nWithin 40 minutes of purchasing these 10c options, they had tripled in value.  I sold 40 of the $10c for $56 a contract (total of $2240).  Remember when I said that I immediately sell half of my contacts if its double?  Well, I sell roughly 1/3 of them if they quickly triple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This dude uses verticals\\/iron condor\\/flying mongoose option strategies.  Not ME!  I use the LEAP FROG!](https://i.redd.it/177p2vmglfh91.gif)\n\nAnyway, I was feeling gracious towards the BBBY followers, so I purchased 200 shares just to do my part in the potential squeeze. I then purchased another 10 of the $10c so that I would be at an even 150 contracts.  I called it quits for the day and decided to hold my 200 shares, 25 contracts of $6.5, and 150 contracts of $10c over the weekend.\n\nI know you're not reading anymore, but I'm on a roll, so I'm going to keep going.  Monday rolled around and BBBY pumped again super hard.  My 10c were now selling for about $220-280 a contract.  I sold 5 of my 6.5 contracts (+2650) and 10 of my 10c contracts (+$2870).  I used that cash to purchase 20 contracts of the $10 for the following week.  I continued to do this for the rest of the day, selling off my $10 contacts for 8/12, then using the profits to purchase $10 contacts for 8/19.  By Tuesday, I had moved all of my positions to calls with an expiration of 8/19.  That day I watched my +15k profit plummet until it was saved by the afternoon pump and fortunately the rest of the week was great.  I ended this week up roughly $50k in partially realized gains from an initial investment of about $2200.\n\nI've taken about 3-4k of my profits and purchased additional shares of TQQQ.  I have 40-50k rolling in short dated options that are currently somewhat ITM.  \n\nI don't know if this helps u/calebbooty9. I think BBBY has everything on its side to absolutely go nuts next week, but I guess we will all see.  Oh, and this is not financial advice.  This is barely English.  I mean, so many run on sentences and inappropriate commas...\n\n$BBBY  8/19  $10c",

For BBBY he has already bought 10% of the company, wrote a feisty letter to the board telling them their shit, then company then ousted their CEO, and now RC is tweeting specifically about BBBY. \n\nHis actions for GME were the exact same leading up to Jan 2021. RC specifically said in the GME June 2021 annual meeting that he does not provide forward guidance for wall street to use against companies.\n\nIf RC is actually doing the same thing he did with Gamestop then you will be waiting a long time for the news you seek. \n\nYou need to decide for yourself if RC will do to BBBY what he did to GME or not.\n\nPersonally I think RC purchasing a fuckload of shares at a price above where BBBY is at now and hasn't sold makes me think he does in fact see value in the company.\n\nRead RC's letter to the board for yourself:\n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\nNow read what he wrote to Gamestop:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf)\n\nHis actions speak louder than his words.\n\nPositions: 325 shares, five Jan 2023 80c, five Jan 2023 60c, and five 8/19 15c",

    "selftext": "It's so nice to see the rise of BBBY and to witness a lot of people in this sub making big gains.\n\nBut let's not fool ourselves. We only need to recall on what happened when GME went up too fast and started endangering the livelihood of those poor hedge fund managers. We know that they will NOT sit down and let us enjoy our tendies. \n\nAs such, let's look at what happened during GME run. According to the Wikipedia record of GME short squeeze, the squeeze start on January 11th at the price of around $19.90. By January 28th and after reaching $347, Robinhood and other exchanges start restricting trade and thus cancelling the squeeze at the expense of a lot of ordinary gamblers\n\nI firmly believe that it is not the matter of if, but when, they will intervene. So my question is when do you think this will happen this time?",

    "title": "Weekend read: This BBBY run is starting to look eerily similar to the GME run in Jan 21",
    "selftext": "Just some personal observations having gone through the Gamestop run-up: \n\n- Both GME and BBBY started their run and sputtered a bit and finished the first week up around 30-40% (rough percentages, I don\u2019t have the actual prices in front of me).\n\n- Second week GME gapped up the following Monday around 30% and ended up the week up around 60% or so. Second week for BBBY is also a gap up on Monday and ended up the week over 60% from last Friday.\n\n- Third week is where all the action in GME took place, a big 50% gap up Monday before it settled down a bit lower and then huge moves on that Tues and Wed, closing the week around $320. Let\u2019s see what this upcoming third week brings to BBBY.\n\nSome other observations. GME short percentage of the float was definitely higher and shorts were caught off guard, you\u2019d think they\u2019re better prepared this time. Also, Ryan Cohen took his stake around 4 months before the GME run-up and here we are 5 months after he disclosed his stake in March.\n\nThe other observation is the level of contempt the financial media and analysts had for GME as though they knew better and tried to save us from our own stupidity. Analysts started coming out of the woodwork panning GME, how it\u2019s a failing business, how it\u2019s going bankrupt, how it\u2019ll be back to $5 next week. Even that same dude, Anthony Chukumba, was all over CNBC and Bloomberg talking how Gamestop is worth $10 and that\u2019s him being generous. The higher the fever pitch against GME, the more interest the stock generated on this board and elsewhere, as if it was an us against them battle. The more people bought the stock and calls, the higher chance for a Gamma squeeze and here we are again with call options exploding and heading into monthly expiration where things can get really wild.\n\nTLDR; similarities between GME and BBBY runs could mean an explosive week coming up, strap your belts.",

    "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably already seen the posts on here over the weekend with BBBY price targets getting higher and higher, now in the thousands. \n\nI honestly feel like a grad student could write a thesis on the \u201cseven stages of squeeze\u201d as all these squeezes seem to roll out in the same way.\n\nI would say we are currently at stage three: The Moving of the Goal Posts. This happens every time. The stock gets some momentum, and suddenly the price targets people would have been fully stoked to get suddenly seem like poultry gains in comparison to the 100x price targets anons start to shit post on here.\n\nIf I had any advice, it is this: stick with that original price target you would have been fully stoked to get before you read all those 100x shit post price targets. I can (unfortunately) say from multiple experiences that bagging your original price target, even if you don\u2019t sell at the exact top, is so much better that watching the price crater under your original price target because you got greedy and held to long. \n\nBRING ON THE ACCUSATIONS OF ME BEING A SHILL - IT ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER. The truth is that a lot of those price target shit posters are the ones shilling you, as they want you to hold your position for as long as possible so the price runs up and they can sell at their own price target (which is lower than the one they were shit posting about). \n\nSome of you may recognize me from my own shit posting hobby on the daily threads. I\u2019m not a shill, I\u2019m just a guy that could be a hell of a lot richer during GME if I didn\u2019t let anons convince me the big money was going to let the price go to $1000 a share, which became my price target. \n\nUnfortunately I loaded up on some positions I believe in so I don\u2019t have a lot of money in BBBY - 134 shares @ $6.74. Wish I had more, but I\u2019m up like 100% so that\u2019s chill.\n\nAnd no, I won\u2019t tell you what my price target is - not looking to add to the cacophony of guesses.

I literally took Venture Capital and Investments three times each (4 semesters apart) so you know that I know my shit better than some idiot who only took those classes once and probably forgot everything after the final.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my kid is very well-meaning, so don't insult that son of a bitch, but he keeps telling me to invest in index funds. In-dicks my ASS. SPY is down 10% YTD, and I made already made 10.89% this month accidentally buying $BBY instead of $BBBY. Making 11% on accident? I'm a god of technical analysis (I can tell that BBY is going up by looking at the 1 month chart, for example) and holding through a bad investment. My soon keeps fixating on \"he's up 1% this year\" when he should focus on my 10% gains this month instead of looking at the broader picture (because that picture also includes some bad months where I lost money even though I made good trades because Ken and the other hedges personally tapped my phone and short laddered the fuck out of me which my son doesn't even know are real).\n\nHe tells me that most traders will lose money (then how come I made 10% in a month alone) but has he even seen the kind of gain porn that's posted here. I study WSB DD thoroughly every night. I come freshly awake to the daily threads where I enthusiastically post\n\n# OPEN THE FUCKING CASINO\n\nYou really think I don't know what I'm doing? I know this is a casino and I like it.\n\nI've had erectile disfunction since I was 19 and discovered porn, but WSB gain porn gives me five and a half hour long erections every fucking trading day. My wife is finally happy (but don't tell her about my portfolio because I'm trying to surprise her with a pink Lambo this September 1st as a happy new month present when BBBY will surely moon). I have fully assimilated within the WSB culture and have done all my due diligence and it is only a statistical inevitability that I will, therefore, receive the bounty of tendies and lambos as soon as BBY moons. Once it moons, I'll pay for my kid's education (so he can fuck off and leave me alone) and proceed to YOLO.\n\n# DO I LOOK LIKE A GUY WITHOUT A PLAN?\n\nI made 10.89% in a month when the market is down 10% in a YEAR? That's a 1282% OUTPERFORMANCE RATIO (Quick maths: (10.89\\*10/31\\*365) = 1282%), which is a term I coined in my MBA thesis class (which I later found out wasn't a real class but a frat attempting to haze me, which I found out wasn't a real frat because they're only for undergrads...it was an enlightening experience). The MBA was for shits and giggles anyway, and I don't use it much in my \"job\" as a data scientist (I just do technical analysis in 3D, so line up is good and that's all I know) but I'm about to leave and YOLO full-time. I even bought an elite trading setup: used 11\" MacBook Air from 2017 (to save money on tech and YOLO it instead) and since it's small, I'm always on WSB and Robinhood wherever I am.\n\nI have about $300k to YOLO, and can you imagine how many Lambos you can get for $300k\\*1282% (which is approx 3.846 BILLION dollars before tax).\n\nThis kid reads from some idiots like John Beagle and Peter Link, and some fucker named Gram. It's so easy to \"read\" all this \"wisdom\" after all the action has happened. I?? I was here (on an alt account since I got banned as I promised to eat my wife\u2019s cum if GME mooned over $10 and didn\u2019t have the balls to) watching DFV post his meat LIVE while GME rocketed. I made a 10000% return back then (in my paper trading account because I was a bigger pussy than my son back then). Not any more. I will go to the fucking MOON with BBY.\n\nMy next move is to make a trading bot to make my tendies for me. I'm now learning a very advanced programming language called HTML (more letters is more complex for those of you who don\u2019t know computers like I do) and when I'm done I will have a killer bot ready to fuck all your puts.\n\nAnyway...didn't mean to rant but since this is flaired a \"discussion\" I guess my question is: how do you YOLO in peace?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr:** Sun dumb and I smart.

Making the float smaller, thus making it a more obvious short squeeze target. \n\nIs it just random that RC joined this particular company which is known to be a memestock? I don\u2019t think so. This must be a part of his strategy to save the company. \nThis is also why i think, they won\u2019t issue shares before we\u2019re significantly over these 16$ levels.

    "selftext": "We\u2019re reaching out today with information about the shares of GME held in your Wealthsimple Stocks &amp; ETFs account. On July 21st, 2022, GME underwent a stock split, also known as a corporate action. You can read more about this in the company\u2019s announcement.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up some commonly asked questions about this stock split so that you can understand exactly what it means and how it impacts your portfolio.\n\nWhy was this treated as a stock split rather than a stock dividend? \nOn July 22nd, 2022, GME underwent a 4-for-1 stock split and trading of the newly adjusted shares commenced. All corporate actions are processed based on the direction of the related applicable parties (e.g. depository agents, transfer agents, and processing providers). As such, Wealthsimple processed the corporate action as a forward stock split in which eligible shareholders received an additional 3 shares of GME for every 1 share held.\n\nHow were the shares allocated from the stock split? \nFor every share of GME that you owned prior to the July 18th record date, you received an additional 3 shares of GME following the stock split. The typical flow for corporate actions goes from the issuing company's transfer agent to the depositories and then lastly to the brokers, which is Wealthsimple in this case. The GME corporate action was treated and processed no different than how we normally post corporate actions. The 3 additional shares were added to eligible shareholder's accounts and are freely available to trade.\n\nHow long does it take to process a DRS withdrawal? \nWe provide a timeline of 4-7 weeks, which accounts for the entire process from actioning the request on our end to you having the shares posted on the transfer agent's end. You can learn more about DRS withdrawals in this Help Centre article.\n\nIs Wealthsimple legally obligated to process a DRS withdrawal in a certain number of days? \nWealthsimple is a Canadian Financial Institution, which means we are governed by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), not FINRA, the SEC, or DTCC, which are the financial governing bodies within the United States. We are processing these requests as quickly as possible on our end and are acting within our obligations to our clients.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to us. We\u2019re here to help.\n\nBest,\nThe Wealthsimple Team",

    "selftext": "I noticed the following:\n - Free cash flow has been very negative\n - There is only $100 million left in cash as of 5/31\n - Company has been burning hundreds of millions per quarter\n - Company is already heavily into debt. Shareholder Equity is almost nothing\n\nIt\u2019s really a genuine question. I want to buy some shares but concerned that this is fundamentally very different from GME.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\n\nEDIT:\n\ndon\u2019t think I should have used the term \u201cbankruptcy\u201d. The real threat I assume is major shareholder dilution. The bull case however is to see the stock up another 2 or 3x and only then see the stock diluted. Current shareholders wouldn\u2019t be impacted too much, and the bear case would be destroyed.\n\nPlease feel free to link any good DD. Thanks",

    "title": "BBBY is well on its way",
    "selftext": "Regards fellow Regards.\n\nI wanted to do a quick update on BBBY as there are some interesting developments and further landmines for shorties.\n\nLooking at what happened to BBBY last week, we saw a big gap up from 8.16 to around 13 and close of 11.31 Monday. What caused such a big move like that was this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lewmlo804sh91.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439d7174ffa44ed087a5e6579ddd11f4ad3690f7\n\nAbove was the options chain as it was Thursday the 4th. On the 5th, as we closed above 8, all of the highlighted calls expired ITM. Approximately 37,118 just going off the open interest in the snap shot I had back then which = 3,711,800 shares.\n\nAs BBBY already had a ton of open interest leading into these recent movements, you will see on virtually all option chains there is a ramp being built. As BBBY moves higher, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy of expiring contracts ITM and further propulsion higher.\n\nHere is the options chain of ITM contracts for Friday (we closed under 13 and remained that way through 5:30 PM which is the last moment you can exercise).\n\nHere is fridays contracts all ITM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekbjpjmv4sh91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e012a8dc978a396616e772e818241be6469bc64\n\nThis represents 62,849 contracts ITM and this equates to 6,284,900 shares. This is roughly just under double what happened on last Friday the 5th.\n\nBelow is Aug 19, this coming Friday and this is already all ITM:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wndkgerd5sh91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0e9fe0cca40f89c1490c5b833cf4fcb6c1d9ae\n\nThis represents 51,618 contracts ITM right now that dont even expire until this Friday and I imagine even more will be added in further out strikes over the week. This represents 5,161,800 shares.\n\nOpen interest is stacking elsewhere too, more particularly on the Sept 16 and further on the Jan 2023. Here are the highlights for whats in store:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsbqgyhw5sh91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748cbb6b01d0ff868a5b275706bb94597a7d6422\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x86lkr9y5sh91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a147237277c66a0d1ec46ddc0b93a28c462363c5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t3wzr316sh91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be658cd876ea5d960c9e670f4b1e78368bf30b3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheres even a cute buildup of open interest on Jan 2024!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nt7uqbq36sh91.png?width=1941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2f3ba50d9e4ad2e9026bf6a7cad8f2e9f8ec0c6\n\nI decided to do the math and if there is any part of all this thesis on BBBY that is a nail in the coffin it's this.\n\nJan 2023 ALONE has 305,170 open interest running from 8 to 80. So if BBBY ever gets to 80, exactly 30,517,000\n\nKeep in mind the stock only has  79,960,000 outstanding shares and a float of  69,450,000. 55,767,626 of which are owned by the top holders of BBBY and 29,000,000 shares are short. So right now between shorted shares and actual holdings not even by any retail at all, 84,767,626 shares are tied up. Throw another 30,517,000 shares in the mix by Jan of 2023 and who knows what the price action will do. Could go down, could go up, who knows!\n\nIf you haven't noticed, all stocks are doing well right now. It is important that the maco economic green light is on so to speak. This makes BBBY the value in BBBY shine even more. BBBY has 7B in trailing 12 months revenue. The ONLY thing \"holding it back\" according to all our favorite analysts is debt. Let something come up about a debt refinance, far OTM warrants offering or restructuring of the bonds break loose and we go even higher because then the analysts won't have anything left to complain about.\n\nLong term it matters if the management company cares about the company and fixing its fundamental problems. Once net income is fixed, BBBY doing 7B in revenues. Buy Buy Baby doing 1.3B. This revenue will only grow especially under this leadership team that actually cares about the company. This in and of itself can command the previous prices in 2013 and 14 of 80/share before Tritton ever got involved.\n\nWorried about some tomfoolery coming in to basically cheat like they did last time? The odds of that are very low now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ro4taj7r9sh91.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01e6ede77ae4a4165cc1f5ab13866ea81eee53f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lptl66ht9sh91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41a7f7ac6301c8066334c04907461ff77d029d2a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/587trmhw9sh91.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b6fa33edb1830fc32c27e5862d8b4a2405ec45\n\nRobinhood is in some hotwater and it serves as a warning to other brokerages who did do the same thing to try it again. It acts as a classical skull on a pole type of message.\n\nThere were some interesting things that happened with GME and its price swings. This sums it up:\n\nEvery day, high frequency trading firms like Citadel siphon away investors\u2019 money using their super-sophisticated, blink-of-an-eye trading systems to anticipate upcoming market moves and pick off investors\u2019 orders at favorable prices.\u00a0 They then turn around and immediately resell those shares at the improved price, pocketing billions of dollars in sure-fire profits.\u00a0 Called \u2018latency arbitrage,\u2019 the practice moves money from the pockets of everyday investors to the coffers of the sophisticated professional traders who get to take full advantage of their \u2018sneak peak\u2019 into the market.\n\n[https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/todays-court-win-for-the-sec-is-a-big-win-for-investors/](https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/todays-court-win-for-the-sec-is-a-big-win-for-investors/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gv2q0pkash91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb115b2444db7508ce719f1b66516b31303a8f23\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6xu226mash91.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a03d5311524b36a2fecada710d8883bbfd6de414\n\nCitadel lost this case July 29th or at least that is when these were reported. Notice anything interesting since Aug? Some stocks have just been on a tear! Coincidence? I leave that up to you. What we do know is a certain someone can't cheat openly anymore.\n\nThe most recent whale wisdom is looking good. We even have a fair bit of healthy disagreement going on with one group buying a TON of puts and another fund happy to take the opposite with a TON of calls:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akylwn5cbsh91.png?width=1671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520436fc1234a3611c7140aeb8c16f9226dc936e\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mentioned earlier that the macro environment matters and it does. Its important to note that its basically party on until mid Sept. Next fed meeting is Sept 21st:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmdoz8fqbsh91.png?width=517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd62495c4e0a605a482a7d6d625248a3c43edb76\n\nNext inflation data Sept 13th:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxdkplvsbsh91.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba7ba1cb7b56f6bbb02bf98ec4f84dbbf31749d\n\nSo there virtually nothing to come in and pull the rug from the broader market macroeconomically. This means that money is coming into the markets because the coast is clear for now and we have seen that happen on just the broader indices. We don't even have BBBY earnings until an estimated 09/29! So there is literally a full month of no random inflation report or JPOW stepping in and destroying the direction of this recent rally.\n\nHeres something to laugh about:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3me9eyqdsh91.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad03db91505cdbf1ddf362e4413a7e94d37b33a4\n\nLastly we still have the update coming this month! What could it be? It could be the start of no return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\n37,118 contracts expired 8/5 propelling us higher on 8/8. lil under double that has expired ITM on 8/12 for 62,849 contracts having expired ITM on Friday. Jan 2023 has 305,170 contracts ITM if it gets to $80 by then. Robinhood has more eyes on its practices than ever and so will other brokerages if they try to pull a fast one and speaking of fast ones, citadel and other traders like them don't have high frequency trading like they used to.\n\nBuckle up buttercup. Gonna be a bumpy ride\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqj1y837dsh91.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e9794accbb6909d0efbd333e2091b152b7b22f",

I know how you people get after a long day of staring at 2 colors for 6:30 hours straight instead of doing your fucking job so I'm going to start off nice and easy with this DD to lightly wrinky those smooth brains of yours, before moving to actual technical analysis to put more folds in your brain than Bezos has in his wallet.\n\nThe one question I keep seeing people ask when it comes to BBBY is \"Can it go any higher?\" Everyone seems so fucking confused on this simple point when the answer is a very VERY obvious: **No shit it can go higher.**\n\n# Can BBBY Go Higher?\n\nThe simple answer is no duh, any stock can go higher or lower. The only limit to how high a stock can go is literally how much money JPOW can print at a given point. The future is unknown and anyone fuckstick on the internet that tells you they know the future is either lying to you, Jim Cramer, or possibly both.\n\nThe future is unknown, but when it comes to pricing we have plenty of data from the past that says **Yes, BBBY can go much, much higher.**\n\nLook! I even have proof:\n\n[As of right now BBBY isn't anywhere close to it's all time high of $79.98](https://preview.redd.it/o33prhdzz4i91.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c4e456ad1cfe680a79ba229ee67e87e8930a02)\n\n[It's nowhere close to its five year high of $35.20](https://preview.redd.it/mdmmtidzz4i91.png?width=1688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8be25a295981ec12138c8e0b63136b6729254f)\n\n[It didn't even touch it's one year high of 29.10](https://preview.redd.it/nm525gdzz4i91.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2918d02bc494b0609a503f1f971cb1d99747ac)\n\n[It hasn't even beaten it's high price of the last 6 fucking months](https://preview.redd.it/0xmb6fdzz4i91.png?width=1688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f261d28b1c6b89b0b2bf4ca6a070cc33b4d1c8a5)\n\n[And \\(most importantly\\) ITS NOT EVEN AT THE HIGH PRICE OF TODAY](https://preview.redd.it/xwgfzqwc05i91.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d6c958daf2d0d8269f5629fd104c551b9201987)\n\nSo i'm hoping i didn't lose any of you there on that advanced piece of analysis that it was literally 30% higher today so no shit it can go higher. **In fact, compared to some of the gains the company has made over the years, this week's gains aren't even that big of an anomaly. We're still in the normal realm of BBBY - the common beyond if you will.** So please go back to munching your Denny's placemat and stop asking this question over and over. It's not the important question.\n\nWhat we want to know is how high can we expect a short squeeze to take BBBY and how likely is one to occur?\n\n# How High Can A Squeeze Take Us?\n\nAgain we're going to keep this pretty fucking easy right now with an argument that is barely even mathematically sound but follow along if you will, my highly regarded apes, as we compare what we're seeing now with the GME short squeeze of 2021. First off, how much did GME grow during it's amazing run?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A table of historical data for Jan 2021 - showing the largest increase over the 2 week period being 1500&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/v227o60475i91.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef934f6a722eeb9463aa14aea3e0a57fd63bee8)\n\nSo over the 2 week peak squeezer that GME received in 2021 stocks went up 15x. If you want to go not far back from there to when prices were $2.53 a share and compare it to the absolute peak of $483 a share you're looking at 190x increase.\n\nWhat's important to note though is that most publications don't even consider the squeeze to have started until it hit the $19 price point - but like we just said just months earlier it was $2.50 a share meaning that it was already up almost 8x. **To the average investor engaged in the squeeze, an 8x increase could have been good enough. Some nay sayers could have said \"The squeeze has already squozen\" and squelched off with their gains - leaving the full 190x gains they could have had on the table.** But like we said already - no one knows the future do they?\n\nNow lets take a look at what has already happened with BBBY:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Taking a look at the last month's worth of data you can see it's jumped from around $5.81 to $16 - slightly less than 3x gains](https://preview.redd.it/eswsuqly95i91.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d318d657d9e3f90fda2f60e24f801bf525ea6838)\n\nNow look at our current situation and compare it to the GME situation. BBBY all time low for the last 3 months is about $4.51 a share compared to today's all time high of about $28 \u2013 **about an 8x increase over the course of a couple months.** Are you seeing what i'm getting at here?\n\nOver the last few months including the gains we saw today we have witnessed what amounts to almost exactly the same gains as GME pre-squeeze. I repeat: we're witnessing historically **PRE-SQUEEZE** levels of gains. And that's not even including the fact that we're currently down 30% from today's all time high meaning we're actually at about 4.5x gains meaning we're due almost twice the gains before the squeeze even starts.\n\nStill don't believe me? Here they are overlayed:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See that orange one? Thats the one we want.](https://preview.redd.it/esiwe8and5i91.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672e893317188aa511648b2d3fef5006083c75cf)\n\nNow am i saying that BBBY will end up anywhere near what GME had? Most likely not - when GME was short squeezed, 140% of the float was squeezed. BBBY is sitting on around 50%. I will say this though, if you're still chasing GME and Popcorn and other symbols trying to make them squeeze still **BBBY's is the highest well hyped stock on the market right now** with GME at a mere %22.39 of the float while popcorn is at %18.40\n\nThis accounts for what we might see when it comes to a short squeeze with BBBY but it doesn't answer if it's likely that it will squeeze. For that we turn to the most important index when determining short squeeze likelihood - the LREN index\n\n# The Most Important Predictor A Short Squeeze Is About To Happen\n\nThat's right folks now it's time for the meat and potatoes of the this DD - the LREN index. Many economists are skeptical about LREN's ability to confirm that billions of dollars are about to be made let me assure you it's been a leading indicator in every trade i've made since getting serious about trading.\n\nI'm talking of course about the LaughRiot Erect Nipple index and i'm please to inform the readers that have made it this far that my nips have not been this aroused about a stock since the GME 2021.\n\nSure some may say that my erect nipples are a poor way to track retail excitement for a stock. Other Wall Street \"insiders\" might say that my supple male milk nobs are a poor analog for other more reliable indices like **Total Trade Volume which has been 21.5x higher than it's daily average** or **Total Call Volume outstripping Total Put Volume by over 2x.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Unusual options trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/3o296prbk5i91.png?width=3218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bc5aca72d6a44b25b61edac8affcf5189c5f22c)\n\nAll of these things pale in comparison to just how erect my nipples are at the moment being on this sub with all of you tendie tasters. And really that does matter because what truly made the last short squeeze go was the Apes in this sub hyping each other up until they put their entire life savings into a company that will buy your physical video games for 1/5th what you paid for them. It was retail's hype that made that squeeze happen and i haven't seen this sub this hyped in years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My nips at the present time](https://preview.redd.it/bwvpxgr6l5i91.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c73023a5285d9a063bd9133108124dcda6406d27)\n\nThank you all for reading. None of this qualifies as financial advice, BBBY to $80 by EoW, and i just like the stock (evidenced above).",

I've never bought anything on margin, ever.  I call up ETrade and they explain that somehow a large portion of my GME shares were converted to a cash holding which caused the margin call...even though I bought these GME shares over a year ago before I even had a margin account.\n\nThey look into it and explain it will be fixed soon.  I ask them if it's okay to go ahead and trade or will this cause an issue (I've never been margin called before so not sure wtf it entails besides pay us our damn money) and he tells me not at all, we wouldn't keep ya from trading.\n\nSo the market opens, I liquidate and I go to buy around 60k of BBBY at around 16.25.  Low and behold, despite having just sold everything I'm told I don't have enough in my account.  Call E-Trade back up and after waiting on hold I get some clueless dude who transfers me to an expert.  The entire 20 minutes I'm on hold I'm just watching BBBY bounce of 18, crying a little inside.  Dude gets on the phone and basically tells me I'm SOL until they clear up the margin call.  Ask to speak to his manager to see if we can expedite it, he says sure...20 more minutes on hold and the line drops.  \n\nI go to call back and I see the margin call is finally gone but BBBY was already at $21...I mean I still bought but it killed me inside knowing that I got screwed b/c of some random fuck up on their end.\n\nAnyways, end of rant.  No idea what flair to use for whining like a bitch and hating on E-Trade so I just used discussion.",

If we compare today to the same day of the GME squeeze, we'd be looking at 1/25/21.\n\nThe previous close was $16.25. On 1/25/21, GME traded as high as $39.80 before falling off a cliff and closing at $19.20 (still 18% green on the day). Does that seem familiar?\n\nThe day after that, GME went as high as $37.25 and closed at $37.00. The day after that, it went up to $95 and closed above $86.  So GME went up ~450% in two days following the day it spiked to near 40 and dropped down to half that. \n\nWith every daily close mirroring the GME squeeze so closely, and even the intraday price action mirroring the GME squeeze so close, it wouldn't be surprising to see this continue to squeeze hard tomorrow and Thursday. \n\nThis Friday would be the day they turned the buy button off. But remember, there are investigations going on for market manipulation because of the removal of the buy button, so it'll be riskier for them to try that again.",

They are all in very different consumer sectors but they can be put under the same umbrella of meme stocks. I still do believe that there is a huge amount of shorts still hanging and with some other big institutions are interested in reversing what happened to GME and want to heavily profit by buying up in the coming days and selling once they believe the peak has been touched. My prediction is that it will go to 80 - 95 dollars per share by this week bringing it's market cap between 6.4 billion and 7.6 billion. \n\nMy current positions are 5p 8/19.

The meme stock soared 57.7% in very active midday trading, and has now more than doubled (up 138%) in three days.

    "title": "Did you YOLO For Rent Money or For Life Changing Money?",
    "selftext": "I've been reading the comments here for the past hour and so many people are upset because of the halt and the slight price drop. Some people are stating that it's better to sell and take profits now.\n\nLook, there's nothing wrong with taking profits but if you think this is as high as it will go, you're wrong.\n\nHere's 4 reasons why you're wrong:\n\n1. BBBY is a very heavily shorted stock. As BBBY stock price goes higher (like it already has in the last 2 weeks), it will cause more and more short sellers to be margin called, forcing them to buy shares at market price, which causes a short squeeze. That short squeeze hasn't even started yet despite what the media tells you.\n2. FOMO. Make no mistake that the rapid rise in BBBY share price is making waves in social media and millions of people are learning about it. Everyone's thinking, and rightly so, that the BBBY share price will shoot up just like GME did in Jan 2021. That means it can and probably will go up to $500 and above per share. So the current share price of $25-$28 is a very attractive entry. Expect huge buying pressure in the next few weeks.\n3. BBBY will be making an announcement sometime in the next 2 weeks. This announcement will most likely announce the sale or spin off of Buy Buy Baby. This will be a very bullish announcement which I predict will cause the share price to sky-rocket. Like I mean go from $50/share to $150/share.\n4. Options chain is looking very bullish. A lovely gamma ramp is set up. Gamma squeeze alone can easily take the share price to well over $100.\n\nSo don't let dips and halts upset you. Share price may go down to $10 a share and if it does, just think of it as a buying opportunity. This roller coaster ride has just started. As for me, I'm not even going to think of selling until we're well into the 3 digits per share. You do you, playa.",

    "title": "Not sure what to think abt BBBY.",
    "selftext": "Hello Gents, I\u2019m new trading this so these are observations and questions I\u2019m hoping someone with experience can answer. \n\nQuick background: I joined Reddit about a year ago after hearing all the GME hype and wanted to learn more. I spent 9 months reading wsb posts and other trading subreddits before opening a trading account. I had never traded before May of this year. I\u2019ve been dabbling to this point, but nothing of consequence. That changed two weeks ago when chatter picked up about BBBY and for the first since I began lurking, I believed this was something to this. I fucked around and up multiple times on this, but managed to be up $12k\u2026until 3:50 this afternoon. By 4:05 I was down $3k. I haven\u2019t sold, though I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t been thinking about it incessantly since the drop. \n\nHere are some things that don\u2019t make sense, in no particular order.\n\n1. I keep reading that 85% of the shares are owned by institutions and that this \u201csqueeze\u201d or battle is mostly them trying to fuck the other(s) over. Idk if this is true, but if it is, why would news of Cohen selling/filing to sell shares cause them to sell off? Why would they give a flying fuck what he does? This could just be bs and irrelevant, but does anyone actually know?\n\n2. There was a large share dump earlier this week and I think the price only dropped from $28ish to $23ish, then recovered fairly quickly. Even if he had unloaded all 9.5M shares, why the massive dump and sudden negative sentiment? Does this change the fundamentals of why retail is investing in this anyway? I suppose I can only speak for myself, but I don\u2019t see my buying 2,500 shares as an attempt to save the company, only an attempt to squeeze a decent profit on a relatively short term play. BBBY can close all stores 6 months from now and I couldn\u2019t care less.\n\n3. How would Cohen filing to sell and not being able to unload all his shares immediately be to his benefit? The price dropped $7/share and could go lower, so an immediate sell would be quite dumb, especially if it\u2019s true that his initial entry was around $14. Perhaps it was $2, so it\u2019s still a profit, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case.  One could only assume that he will sell in the next 90 days, but it seemed to me that the sentiment on here before today was that the price would be at $45 by EOW, so why would he sell now? If anything, the price drop would disincentivize an immediate sell, thus invalidating the sell off? Am I mistaken?\n\n4. That\u2019s all for now and I suppose the 3 above could be summed up in, why the fear of staying in? Should I also be fearful and exit my position before it gets any worse? What am I missing? \n\nPosition: https://imgur.com/a/ve7Zmy0",

    "selftext": "For those that are new to a short squeeze, are experiencing basic FUD tactics. Today, RC filed a form to allow himself to sell his shares. That makes a lot of sense because this is squeezing, and we are all here to make money when this squeezes, even RC. However, RC is not a paper handed bitch. He increased his BBY position to 11.8%. He bought GME way before the squeeze and still didn't sell. As a matter of fact, a few months ago, he also increased his GME position. Also, look at the strike options RC is holding. Do you really think he plans on selling when the stock is nowhere near $65 or even $80 for his most OTM calls. Again, I repeat, RC is not a paper handed bitch. He hasn't sold.\n\nSo, what happened today, is some SHF decided to short the stock to scare us into selling. Then, Seeking Alpha decided to publish an article incorrectly reporting that RC sold his shares. They fixed it now, but they made it sound like RC sold. This article came out a few minutes after the short attack. Was this coordinated? I think so. Can I prove it, no. \n\nHowever, what you are seeing now is the same thing that happened to GME. Remember, it dropped violently before going well past $400. VW also dropped hard before it squeezed. This drop we are seeing now is nothing. The stock hasn't even gone past $30 yet and we have yet to have a 100% gain day. This stock is not done squeezing. Today, SHFs fired the first shot. This is proof of their desperation. They think they can scare us into selling so that they don't have to cover their short positions. They are wrong. Don't fall for the traps. BBBY is only going up from here and the ride just began.\n\nOh, and expect a lot more tricks along the way including them turning off the buy button once this gets too much for them to handle. It happened with GME. No reason it can't happen here either.",

There are two different pages to search form 144s dependent upon if it was filed electronically or through mail. Interestingly enough the paper records only go back to right after the point at which RC ventures would have filed their last one. I believe this was known by RC and is being used as the match that lights the fuse for the rocket to the moon. [Paper form 144 filings records](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER)\n\nThis got my ape wheel thinnning. I think that perhaps the story was planted with a reporter to create the FUD  and sell off In order to have the short headphones double down on their short positions. Cohen will announce that he has the intention to sell to meet the intention required of the 144 provision when BBBY meats a certain milestone, perhaps something like the announcement of a certain baby store getting sold off or split to its own stock.\n\nThis will cause BBBY to squeeze, Cohen well then sell his positions, use the proceeds to double down on GME triggering the mother of short squeezes. \n\nWham!

He also can only sell up to 1% of outstanding shares.\n\nWhy is no media source acknowledging these facts? Instead the narrative is pushed that RC is pulling the rug out from investors. At the same time, after hours price is tanking when it\u2019s largely made up of professional and institutional traders.\n\nBBBY has GME squeeze potential. Cramer has been going nuts trying to push boomers away. Big plunges are occurring to scare paper hands away. Clearly uninformed media reports are being pushed. Someone is scared shitless.\n\nWill you be part of history?\n\ne: I gotta pull back a little bit after the initial reaction. RC actually has held a portion of his shares for 6 months.\n\nLink to his filing:\nhttps://sec.report/Document/0001193805-22-000426/\n\nStill, my point stands that using this form he can only sell up to 1% of outstanding shares. If you really think he bought enough stock to swing 3 board seats, pushed out the CEO, and went baller for $60, $75, and $80 calls just to paper hand on the first small squeeze, then good luck to you. The bull case for him filing this form is it now gives him the opportunity to sell to exercise his calls. Without this form, he was not able to complete this squeeze by exercising when we get to those levels.",

I want you to all do your own DD (HA we know you wont) but just keep that in mind that its interesting how no one spoke of BBBY until we saw the massive pump this week and the minor sell off today. If Firms who are shorting in the billions cannot scare enough of you away to panic sell they know damn well they will have another GME on their hands. Imo itll be closer to AMC with the price movement but still. Take a shot pull your panties up and ruin some 50 year old white hedgies year by shafting him with a quality short squeeze.

He is thinking in the terms of \"Buy Buy Baby\" as a potential online retailer and not just a \"Brick and Mortar\"- Company.\n* Remember Gamestops new valuation when it was no longer classified as a \"Brick and Mortar\" Company but also as an emerging online retailer? 175usd a share pre-split prices, and its roughly there Gamestop is today with a marketcap of 12 billion dollars at a 40usd a share. What will BBBY:s new valuation be when its announced that its focusing more on an online market? , 80usd a share? 120 usd a share, 250usd a share?\n* At 26 dollars a share (down to 20usd(!) now after the Short-Attack + FUD ,god people are dumb), the marketcap of BBBY is currently 1.5 billion dollars. Current marketcap for Gamestop is about 12 billion dollars (as just mentioned)...\n* ... And NOW things get interesting, BBBY has a revenue of 8 billion dollars annually. Gamestops has a revenue of 6 billion annually. BBBY has 25% higher revenue than GME at a 1/7 of the price.\n\n**I will repeat:**",

    "selftext": "Dearly Regarded,\n\nThroughout WSB, we're STILL seeing posts of despair and insecurity surrounding BBBY.  Paper handed b\\*tches running wild throughout the streets jerking off as soon as the feeling comes, but diamond hands know holding it down results in the greatest pleasure of all.  As many posts have mentioned, BBBY is following the exact same path as GME.  Why?  What is driving it?  What's making it such a pleasure to wake up everyday?  The answer is here.  \n\n1. The short squeeze.  YES, the short squeeze. Not referring to you nerds jerking off on a Wednesday to the BBBY chart.  Right now the short interest is 46%, more than enough juice to squeeze, and the squeeze is cuming.  \n2. Exercised calls.  YES, you cockmuffins talking about capturing as much extrinsic value as possible by not ever exercising your calls; you're abandoning your fellow soldiers.  Exercise them glutes!  Make the shorts pay for their arrogance by blowing BBBY Beyond the Moon, Beyond Mars, to Uranus and Beyond.  \n3. Market Cap weight indexes.  What dis mean?  It means the more we buy, the more they buy!  If we blow up BBBY, the institutional whales MUST, by definition of their fund, buy BBBY.  If we don't sell, then that buying pressure increases the market cap of BBBY even more, meaning they  will need to buy even more to balance their index, and so on until BBBY reaches infinity. \n4. Diamond Hands.  We apes now control the MAJORITY of the float.  What does that mean?  It means the price will not maintain any sort of downtrend UNLESS we fold and sell our dignity to the algos.  You wouldn't sell your mother to the algos, so why TF would you sell BBBY??  \n\nOne last bit of DD.  Buy Buy Baby is a massive play on the pandemic baby boom.  Anecdotally, my sister just got pregnant out of wedlock; babies are coming.  That's it, that's all there is.  If we buy, exercise and hold, we will win, and we will win big; it's simply a mathematical certainty.  Take destiny into your own hands, and move your hands up and down until you fulfill your oath to your fellow man, ape and regard.  \n\nTLDR, we control BBBY's fate now.",

The only thing you have now left is to behave irrationally. Like when we all speculated with SPACs in the initial phase, with GMEs, AMCs and shut the mouth of all the red-flaggers in the media calling Reddit and retailers \"dangerous and ignorants\".\n\nYou already have your rational and valuation-based portfolio. You can still buy MSFT or GOOGL and will be able to buy tomorrow. But the BBBY trade is a once in your life chance given the very rare circumstances: Like it happened with GME, you all now have a strong storytelling (watermelons, Anti-Cramer, unity...) and this is time to say FUCK you FED and your inflation fight. We already suffered an erosion in our power bargain, we didn't decide to get involved in a war in the east of Europe but the entire world will pay the consequences, etc...

I\u2019m about to call rn and I\u2019ll post a link of the duration of the call once I\u2019m done along with an update.

I talked to a wonderful lady rep and she seemed to have energy in her voice at the start until I asked about directly registering BBBY with their transfer agent. I said I\u2019ve done it before with GME. I was put on hold (this is typical not bullish lol) so she could find out if the stock is eligible. 5 min later she got back and said I could do it and if I want to. I said no thank you, that it was just a future possibility. One thing I noted was in the 8min convo 2 min was actually talking, so I guess moral of the story is to hold and you\u2019ll get an answer. Oh this is also the first time ever I had the driest, quietest, most dead beat, \u201cthank you for choosing fidelity and have a nice day\u201d she actually mumbled the second half.

Here's my made up story and mental gymnastics to convince you otherwise. \n\nCollege boy story before close yesterday was odd to me.\nIn hindsight now, it was everything. \nThen: Meh, HODL APES TO THE MOON, and what not. Against my gut even, if I'm honest. I digress: Here's why it's the most significant thing, and why I've been kicking myself in the ass for being regarded, as an ape will be:\n\nA little digging found that homie child dropped 25m early on: This is what lead to the first balloon, and the indicator that RC was some kind of fucking wizard, forcing hurricane like winds through that dog whistle, picked up by the apes around the world. Now it's climbing, we have another meme stock bois, $GME 2.0 TO THE FUCKING UR-ANUS. FOMO ensues.\nSome savvier folks are in already big at $4. Chumps like me, I averaged at about $12 at the first climb. I was sitting good.\n\nHYPE TRAIN IN WSB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nGood close. Tendies are a guarantee.\n\nNext day, somewhat uneventful. Couple halts, but fever pitch in the ape enclosure. We're fucking doing it bois.\n\nMeanwhile, college boy is dumping his shares. After hours brings the 144. Copium starts to flow.\nBro, this is good bro. Trust me. He's going to take use to the planet of watermelon fuckery boys. CRAMMERR EAT SHIT\n\nSteady decline to the toilet all day after cheers of $100/ea by Friday bois HODL (I'm guilty) \n\nWe all know this part, but here's the other part:\nI can't prove this: RC is connected in some way to rich daddy of little college prick. Uptick trend was noticed and people started buying in large amounts. The trap was laid with $80 calls by the man himself, there's no way this doesn't work out yeah?\nExcept no, because once homie kid made his bag, and it was blasted.. meme stock intensity grew. Mfers are YOLO, DD to the moon, selling kids and houses. Taking loans. Short positions are fucked boiiisss. WE GOT EM\nAll in one fell swoop, RC cleared 110m-ish, cleared his terrible calls and position in a company about to file bankruptcy, and cleared his name with his wall Street buddies by offering up a chunk of ape stew for dinner. CFO chucked the deuces. APES everywhere in suicide watch.\n$GME 2.0 turned into RCFU 1.0 in a heartbeat.\nRC used the DFV and $GME nostalgia against us.\nThese mfers don't have more money than God by getting fucked by window lickers in the market on the exact same plays every time.\n\nTL;DR: Cohen set a trap with high future calls. The trap was baited with a multi million influx, creating the appearance of a squeeze. HF got a little stretched to show an inflated interest rate. Multi million cash out. Article written. Meanwhile: Cohen silently liquidating. Short sneeze. Halt. After hours filing of 144.\nSwing rule coping. Cohen injects ineligible profits into company, collects 110m chump change, exits his position and shits on your children's bed. Stock tanks. Game over.",

    "title": "Fair-weather Friends: Trust in Cohen",
    "selftext": "This will likely be an unpopular opinion that gets down-voted into the ground, but I don't give a shit, it needs to be said.\n\nFor the last year and a half, Ryan Cohen was the savior of the little guy, leader of the meme stocks. Between the GME transformation, and now the BBBY events, he has been hailed as playing 4D chess and having a master plan. That is until he sells his BBBY position and everyone instantly turns on him, calling him a traitor and trying to get everyone to turn on GME. This all reeks of FUD. \n\nCoke Rat Cramer is already calling for an investigation by the SEC of Cohen based on how he traded BBBY. Imagine what allegations would have come out if he sold at $100. Also, let's not forget, it wasn't Cohen that ran up the price of BBBY, he's had his position since March in the $15s and rode it all the way down to the $4s without selling. It was retail buying pressure that drove the price up, and it's retail buying pressure that can continue to drive it up. The company is back to being undervalued at $790m (as of writing this), and they still have to release their news statement regarding BuyBuyBaby at the end of this month. \n\nWe don't know right now why Cohen sold. Perhaps he is trying to trap shorts (imagine how hard they jumped in on this news) only for BBBY to release good news tomorrow or next week. While Cohen is a great catalyst to have on board, he's not the only thing that can moon this stock price. The same day BBBY went up, FUBO also mooned 70+%, Cohen has nothing to do with that. The entire short basket was ripping. \"Why?\" you ask. Because shorts were in deep shit, that's why. \n\nSo before you go turning on Ryan Cohen, think that he may actually have a plan or reason for his actions. Watching his behavior for the last 18+ months makes it hard for me to believe that he would simply stick it to retail. Have faith that he did this for a reason, and that he may not be able to say right now what that reason is. If you're simply going to bail at the first sign of a dip then this game isn't for you. \n\nBuy a watermelon, relieve some stress, quit crying, and buy the dip.",

    "selftext": "I saw a lot of people selling the BBBY share because Ryan Cohen sold it, but for me that's personally not the reason I bought it.\n\nI won't lie to you and will tell you my facts: I bought it because I saw there's quite a high percentage of hedge funds shorting the company and thought another short squeeze like GME could happen. Even though the stock is tumbling down at the moment, I will probably buy more since I followed the GME squeeze closely and it still follows the same pattern (history always repeats itself). \n\nNow I do have a question for you: are you selling because if Ryan Cohen or holding/buying the dip because you believe we can create another huge short squeeze?",

    "selftext": "So like a lot of you I\u2019m a regarded at this stuff and am new to trading. I just wanted to outline some lessons I\u2019ve learnt from taking a loss that is maybe just half a months rent but could\u2019ve been so much worst. You should also hopefully realise these lessons too.\n\n1) GME was literally a one in a million, any memestock that comes now, just sell and make a profit, any bad shit can happen and the bigger players will always win as we are tiny compared to them\n\n2) Don\u2019t get too addicted to it, I\u2019ve been looking at the BBBY chart for nearly the whole week non stop and it\u2019s fucked completely with my thinking and mind. Maybe if I had a clear head I would\u2019ve just sold. I\u2019ve been having dreams of this mooning ffs and waking up early excited to check the stock price\u2026\n\n3) Invest money you are comfortable to lose, I personally put $1500 into this, I\u2019m probs gonna end up losing about $700 in this which I thought I wouldn\u2019t care if I lost but now that it\u2019s happened I do care\u2026\n\n4) If you have lost big money on this that will majorly affect your life, I beg you to seek out to family or friends or a support service for help. Money affects your way of life but it should never be a reason to end your life, from personal experience I\u2019ve seen a mum put into depression and her life be ruined from a child\u2019s suicide, suicide is much worst than any amount of money to be lost\u2026\n\n5) Ryan Cohen isn\u2019t your friend\u2026 no big player is, they are rich for a reason\n\nI know this place is mainly jokes and shit but I want to just write this and vent at the same time. In a way I\u2019m happy I lost as the lesson hits harder, I\u2019m excited to sell so I can get my life back on track and forget about this company.\n\nFrom now on I\u2019m gonna be way more conservative about investments and trades and take things a lot more slower",

    "selftext": "First off: wow the FUD is absolutely insane right now, reminds me of Jan 2021. Anyway:\n\nIt seems obvious that he didn't sell to make personal profit--especially given that the momentum and key indictors (volume, short interest, borrow rate, FOMO etc.) put $BBBY on nearly a straight upward trajectory through yesterday.\n\nMy guess is that he cleared the runway for us because **he only sold AFTER $BBBY went on REG SHO August 16th**. That signaled that the squeeze is imminent, same as it was with GME as we all know. I think he decided to get out *before* the squeeze since, as a billionaire, there's not much higher to go but more importantly; by exiting prior to the major runup he avoids any accusations of pumping or manipulating $BBBY for his own gain.\n\nWe know he's on retail's side, that is not in question. If you honestly think this is a \"rug pull\" for around a measly sub-$100M (estimates are between $60-90M) I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. Think for a little bit before you panic, personally I think this will be the last dip before we see a huge runup. I'm transferring over funds ASAP to take advantage of this opportunity and many others will do the same. This is the moment that makes you a diamond-handed ape.\n\n# Remember this: SHORTS HAVEN'T CLOSED AND HEDGIES ONLY WIN IF YOU LET THEM! \ud83d\udecc\ud83d\udec0\ud83d\ude80\n\n^((My positions:) [^(https://i.imgur.com/IY1FFaY.png)](https://i.imgur.com/IY1FFaY.png))\n\nEDIT: I also somehow forgot that [BBBY released an 8K **yesterday**](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16356/html) which proves we don't know the full story yet (hint: it's bullish):\n\n&gt;\u201cWe were pleased to have reached a constructive agreement with RC Ventures in March and are committed to maximizing value for all shareholders. We are continuing to execute on our priorities to enhance liquidity, make strategic changes and improve operations to win back customers, and drive cost efficiencies; all to restore our company to its heritage as the best destination for the home, for all stakeholders. Specifically, we have been working expeditiously over the past several weeks with external financial advisors and lenders on strengthening our balance sheet, and the Company will provide more information in an update at the end of this month.\"",

But we know RC has a plan and it doesn't involve pi55ing off his stake holders of GME.\n\nAs we know a good chunk of the Shares and all the Options were purchased less then six months ago (late Feb). \n\nAs per Section 16(b) of the 'Securities Exchange Act of 1934', more commonly known as the 'Short-Swing Profit Rule' states:\n\n*A company insider, as determined by the rule, is any officer, director, or shareholder who owns more than 10% of the company's shares is required to return any profits made from the purchase and sale of company stock if both transactions occur within a six-month period.*\n\nTherefore the vast majority of RC Ventures profits will be handed to BBBY, which will be reinvested or used to clear debt. \n\nSource of 'Short-Swing Profit Rule' clause:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortswingprofitrule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortswingprofitrule.asp)",

Actually, they are practically miniscule compared to his net worth. \n\n3. He is famous for always defending the shareholders. Furthermore, Gamestop is massively owned by retail investors and this decision could cause a pretty steep decline in the valuation of his GME holdings. I mean, we all know that there is a significant chance for him to dump his GME shares at anytime. \n\n\nWhat is your opinion about the reasons behind his decision?

Checking the $BBBY daily discussion post brought me together with other money-hungry apes worldwide. Some of us made lots of money and most likely lost a lot like me, but we all came together for the same common goal.\n\nIn summary, boys, there will always be another opportunity. Instead of going at each other's necks and making it a competition to who is less of a fucking idiot, we need to unite and buckle down and either go up or to $0. Either way, coming together despite the outcome is the most crucial piece of the puzzle. \n\nI been here before $GME and will be here till I go bankrupt or, god forbid, die.",

PLEASE! cut your losses, reinvest in something smart...\n\nNever Yolo everything...\n\nI have to be honest with you, I entered under 10, hoped for 35-40 in momentum, didn't quit until today at 12  USD.\n\nI was bullish as shit, but not for long term, BBBY is not MSFT... come on, be real with yourselves.\n\nI made a comment few days ago that is sitting at -9 points\n\n\"Realistically? This hype train will die out in 6 weeks, and then limbo, see AMC and GME, squeeze was squozen, thinking that GME will moon, at this point makes no sense. I don't think it was squozen for BBBY yet. I can see huge gains this week, with the hype train, I'm happy to see spike to 35 and get out in part, maybe 50 if we really fuck up the algorithms, as much fun as it is to see the candles, even DFV reduced his position. Cash is cash, buy SPY and Nasdaq til EOY, gamble with some, but not all your money.\n\nEOY 50 USD is possible, but speculative as fuck!\n\nSurely, I don't think we will see single digit price in this stock for a very long time, same with GME and AMC, gorrila is out the cage.\n\nDD with my finest crayon's:\n\nAt the moment we are at 13 usd, valued 1 billion. With 35usd per share, company valuation will be approx 3,2 billion dollars.... As it stands GME and AMC were squeezed to, at this moment, 12 billion in evaluation, and BBBY is just about 1 billion now, see my fucktard way of thinking? I also refuse to believe that shorts learned their lesson, better yet, they're likely bullish to ride that wave for a week or two, and then they'll exit, which will cause some massive drops.\n\nMy valuation math is probably fucked, it's Saturday, so I ain't sober and I'm not doing maths for you, someone will comment below, correcting me.\n\nSo yes, I can believe that AMC and GME crowd will jump on the bandwagon and will push the valuation this high, purely out of the mechanism of the market, and to have another GME moment.\n\nPurely momentum, I can see 35 EUR spike this week, and Friday with bunch of options expiring will be fun, for sure.\n\nMind you, week ago Monday bbby shot up 60% in a single day. This play was still relatively under the radar for most, this has changed last week, when everyone noticed the spike and started paying attention. Loads of calls were executed this Friday for strike price 10 - 10,50 Seeing the posts here, there's a number of options that will expire on the 19th, for the same strike price.\"",

    "selftext": "Okay so I\u2019m sure the title is pretty self explanatory but I\u2019ve been reading so many different angles on what happened over the past couple days. It feels so reminiscent of the GME squeeze in the sense of when it had all it\u2019s hype and started ascension. We all know it did fuel up after falling greatly several times only to do what it did aka 400\u2019s. \n\nAll this being said, this is where you go in the kitchen and get the roll out. I truly don\u2019t even think I would say I believe this as fact but more so a discussion on a narrative I could see have happened. So first Cohen is ALREADY suggested for market manipulation by silently filing to sell in the 20\u2019s????? When it has the potential to fucking rocket so soon. So that then leads me to question if that isn\u2019t the best for every party involved in excluding shorts. Not only does this make Cohen money but also BBBY to help keep them afloat longer to extend a squeeze if at all possible if you weren\u2019t some paper hand bitches. \n\nSo in my thought process after smoking some of finest medical grade Diablo lechuga thought \u2018damn, this man copped a bag, helped BBBY, gave you pussies a fucking discount on the same stock you just cried was \u2018too high in the 20\u2019s but I\u2019m all in anywhere lower\u2019, and probably made it look so much better for himself in the courts eyes saying that he couldn\u2019t have manipulated the market if he could\u2019ve just bled them for 100\u2019s per share if it followed GME\u2019s history like I had mentioned. \n\nLike I said I don\u2019t necessarily think this guy is a fucking clown scumbag and that I am not truly this biggest regard on WSB but I\u2019d say if this guy is supposedly smarter than myself and many others than, and even I can think of this clapped out of my mind then maybe it\u2019s a possibility right?",

    "title": "GME Price Action, January 22-27, 2021",
    "selftext": "Fellows, to begin: your financial situation is your own. Please exercise caution in the context of that situation. If you haven't done that, it probably feels shitty but... get over it because you are alive, for now, and hopefully you can still control that.\n\nAfter seeing the pants-shitting drop in the stock yesterday, it got me thinking about how the ride felt back in good old 2021 with GME.\n\nBy Friday January 22, 2021, GME had already more than doubled in price in a week and tripled in 5 months, but there was still a story to write. On that day, the stock went from $40 at open (pre-split figures) and rocketed to $80 by 1pm, closing at $60 - an intraday decline of 25%.\n\nOn Monday January 25th, GME immediately opened at $100. Before 11am, it had reached $160. It subsequently collapsed back to $60 and closed at about $80 (this is all on Monday). The stock had an intraday decline of 60% at the lows, and 50% to the close. Anyway, as you might recall, nothing else happened after that.\n\nThe prices I have quoted were fleeting, but you had 2 days to sell at prices above $200 on Wednesday and Thursday. I don't know if the BBBY squeeze is over because the stock went down 60% and Ryan Cohen sold his \\~10% of the company, or honestly, how much he actually owned including options. What I do know is the price goes down when there are 'sellers'. Do you smell what I am cooking? Does the combined $300mm sold by RC and that other nerd - as of Wednesday, maybe 20% of the company by market cap - justify the 60% downside? Maybe it does. But I'd just like to remind that to the extent you are able, it might still be interesting to take the ride with the ticket you have bought, if you have a strong enough stomach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a pedestrian \\~$1k long options position in BBBY - opened most of it today. I am not willing, but able, to lose all of it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",

    "selftext": "I've been posting under a shiny new handle this week because I'm too embarrassed of my behavior to be honest about my BBBY trades on my main account. This whole thing was truly a relapse for me, because after years of gambling, I'd been conservatively poking away with \"the wheel\" strategy, making $1k to $2k per week. Until this week my YTD performance graph showed 33% growth vs. the S&amp;P at -10% and Nasdaq at -16%.\n\nI've been on WSB since GME. I know AMC, BB, BBBY and others have been darlings since then, but I never played because these are companies that are obviously not doing well, with BBBY really being in the worst shape. Even compared to GME I had never seen so much WSB alignment on one meme stock before, Ryan Cohen was involved, and it looked like the pop was imminent.\n\nI took all the bait and went in for almost $100,000. Today I sold for a $50,000 loss in share value, which was slightly bolstered by selling covered calls and buying puts. Total loss was $28,000 real dollars.\n\n# Where I Should Have Started this Post \ud83c\udf49\n\nSo why not HODL? Did you see what just happened with Ryan Cohen's stock sale? We looked at [a real, public document](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER/43719), with the number of shares he intended to sell, with a fucking date on it, and said NAHHHH, FAKE NEWS! We seriously lost our minds.\n\n# Math Part \ud83d\udcc8 \ud83d\udcc9\n\nThe same day of Cohen's sale, the CFO sold 55,000 shares. Both of their profits are relatively paltry for the worlds they live in. That [kid in California](https://fortune.com/2022/08/18/jake-freeman-usc-student-netted-110-million-dollars-in-bed-bath-beyond-stock-dump/) made twice as much profit as Cohen. If Cohen's \\~$68 million went to BBBY for some reason, as some here are repeating, that would represent more than half of the total cash they had on hand three months ago!\n\nLook at the bottom of page 5 of their June quarterly filing:[https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/446b5112-75d4-4588-9127-136783bb82cc](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/446b5112-75d4-4588-9127-136783bb82cc)\n\nThey burned $900 million in the last year and had $110 million left at the time of this report.\n\n$900m divided by 12 months = $75m per month &gt;&gt; June plus July = 2 months &gt;&gt; 2 months times $75m = $150m &gt;&gt; $110m minus $150m = **negative $40,000,000 at the beginning of August**.\n\nStill looking at this part of the sheet, they have $5 billion in liabilities with $1.3 billion being actual debt. Both of these numbers are up $200 million from last year. They made less money and they spent more money. Nothing here is getting better, and *all of their value is in their property and inventory*.\n\n# IMPORTANT PART \ud83d\udea8\n\nThere was more news yesterday, that [they have hired the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/bed-bath-beyond-is-said-to-tap-kirkland-ellis-for-debt-help).\n\n&gt;[Chambers Review](https://chambers.com/department/kirkland-ellis-bankruptcy-restructuring-usa-5:513:12471:1:3636)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**What the team is known for**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A global leader in the field of bankruptcy and restructuring, and widely acknowledged as the preeminent practice for debtor representation in Illinois.

Also noted for its representation of creditor-side clients.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Strengths**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Kirkland &amp; Ellis is a high-end resource for bankruptcy matters.\"\n\nBBBY is going to declare bankruptcy, like, ASAP. Like as fast as Cohen's shares were sold and the bubble burst over the last two days.\n\nCohen took *all* of his money out so he didn't lose his entire investment, not to make a profit.\n\nThis is not a company that can restructure or reimagine themselves like GameStop, with NFT bullshit, or AMC, which simply needed a loan until customers came back. You don't go shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond. You order from Amazon and someone brings it to your house.\n\nAmazon generates a lot of revenue on sales but almost no profits, with all of their profits coming from AWS which is relied upon by companies like Netflix, Twitch, LinkedIn, Facebook, and everyone else. BBBY cannot compete with a 0% profit margin. At best they can open a store on Amazon.\n\n# T L D R, G T F O",

    "selftext": "RC is a Billionaire. It makes no sense he would sell his position for a $68M profit.\n\nThey said RC and BBBY reached an agreement yesterday, we don\u2019t know what that is yet but it will be announced before the end of Aug.\n\nRC has had a strong relationship with Apes for a long time now. $68M also not worth trashing your rep and image and ego and fan club for. It's not even a profit, it's a hundred million loss with the GME impact taken into account (which he is well aware of). Throw in his entire brand, and obsessive personal identity towards the little guy, and there's no way he would do this without something guaranteed to counterbalance and knock it out of the park.\n\nSelling his stake was likely part of that agreement. Liquidity for BBBY was specifically mentioned and this fits, if they get his Insider Stake. What RC gets in return, we don\u2019t know yet. We can speculate, Buy Buy Baby is the only asset of value that comes to mind.\n\nBig announcement incoming boys and girls, by the end of the month if not tomorrow AM.\n\nSomething way, way bigger than a little profit on stock trade. Think Bigger!\n\nI choose to trust RC for now.\n\nPosition: 614 at $4.78, haven't sold anything.\n\nStop being little bitches. Most of you bought because of a short squeeze anyway, not RC. And the squeeze is still in play.\n\n**Edit**: not $19M but $68M as some of you have pointed out. My opinion stands. He had multiple opportunities to sell for more than that in the past 5 months and he didn't.\n\nAs for calling some of you little bitches, yes you are. And stop playing risky stocks with money you can't afford to lose.\n\n**Edit2:**  What a lot of people aren\u2019t realizing is that RC\u2019s GME stake is worth 1.5B. His original investment in the company was &lt;100M. Apes helped him make over 1B on that investment and are a huge percentage of the companies shareholders. Why would he risk hurting a 1.5B investment to make 68M. GME going down even 12% would be worse for him than BBBY going to 0. Lots of people aren\u2019t getting this, it\u2019s not that he\u2019s just a good guy, it\u2019s that financially, it\u2019s in his best interest for us to support him. ",

    "selftext": "My theory: He traded early as the alternate source of funding that BBBY has been getting legal advice for. It's within the 6 month window so legally some of those profits go to the company. He eliminates some company debt, without dilution, and it doesnt even drop the price as he's doing it, in fact it skyrocketed as he started to sell. Now aftermarket tanks because the news of this paired with another round of short sellers dipping thier balls in.\n\n\n\nNews is coming of BuyBuyBaby, this was the deep value that got a lot of people in the first place. When that news drops as well as that they have paid off a significant portion of debt the price will jump based on underlying alone. Again, this is why they have hired these highly renound lawers, theyre the best at selling/splitting/spin-offs and BuyBuyBaby is going to be just one of those thing. Now theres no direct proof of this but over the last few weeks there have been lots of small things pointing that they are keeping Bby. Double sided bags to people discussing where they buy their diapers. With the capital RC hads over from the short-swing they wont need to sell Bby and again, BBBY goes Brrrr\n\n\n\nHe dropped his end of the shares in order to save the company, his net worth is 2.7B. Like his big goal in this was 2.75B? No he will have lost way yoo much following and goodwill (which is an accountable $ ammount in business) across GME rather than strengthen an already incredibly strong brand. People are super short sighted and I understand its definitely scary when your own balls are on the line. But I believe has a longer play at hand that will rally even more following. Its really hard for shit to happen overnight and the short sellers will do everything they can to distract feom that fact and make it seem like hes out and hes silent about it, he's still with BBBY.\n\n\n\nEdit: typos",

    "selftext": "Don't let the visual mod fool you, I'm brand fucking new to this sub. I missed GME, I missed AMC and I stubbled onto BBBY completely at random while checking daily volatility. I've been occasionally lurking on here for the past six months to keep tabs on things in case you pulled a new GME out of your collective asses that I could ride the money train on, and it looks like I'd just found a ticket.\n\nWhen I stumbled upon BBBY it was at $8 a share. When I bought in, it was at $9.... *$9!!!* Which means that if I had just bought shares I'd still be in the green even with the catastrophic dick kick that happened yesterday!.. But of course I didn't. I bought risky, short term, out of the money calls, and figured, \"Fuck the apes. Let them do the hard work of HODLing and I'll just sit here and cash their checks.\" And you know what? That shit paid. I started with a $5k investment, that quickly turned into $15k, then $50k!!! \n\nI could have just cashed out then... But my degeneracy got the better of me. And for every call I sold, I bought back in with higher and higher strikes... As I'm sure you're painfully (or gleefully aware), eventually, my wax wings melted. $50k turned to $35k, turned back into $5k and is now $1000. In that moment, I realized that I'd become everything I swore I never would, a degenerate, money obsessed, gambling addict. \n\nBut there had been another factor at play. The more BBBY rose, the more I came back to the WSB sub. I got swept up in the pageantry. I started posting regularly. And what I had anticipated to be an army of insufferable toxic monsters, we're actually helping me. Smarter retards than I were giving me salient information in a digestible way about how the securities market worked. \n\nOnce BBBY crashed, I thought I'd seen all that good will evaporate. Now that the party was over all the trolls came out to feast. They were calling for blood- demanding loss porn!.. \"Fuck it,\" I thought, \"it'll be a good lesson in hubris if nothing else.\" So I posted my loss porn... And then the strangest thing happened... An occurrence I'd never expected... People were nice to me. Like really genuinely nice. People were sending me DM's just to check in and make sure I was okay! That the money I'd lost wasn't my food or my rent! \n\nLook, I don't know if have a point to all this. Hell, I don't know if I anyone's even going to bother to read all this. But from what I can tell, in my *violently* small time here on the sub. Things seem a little... Fractured at the moment and people are looking to rally around an idea. Well, I say rally around that. Rally around each other. Because Bed, Bath and Beyond didn't contact me to see if I was okay, my broker sure as shit didn't. The Hedgies and Ryan Cohen's of the world would gladly drag me across a bed of nails for a nickel!\n\nIf there's any kind of tl;dr to be gleaned from this long rambling screed it'd be this: \"Ape alone weak... Apes toge+her strong.\"",

I enjoyed the loss/gain porn and dreamed of emulating these monsters with no regard for their big bags. \n\nWSB was like my inside trader. I felt like I was getting pro tips on stuff outside of the mainstream\u2019s field of view. \n\nThen all the sudden this sub has turned to shit.\n\nIt makes me wonder\u2026\n\nHow infiltrated has this sub become? We don\u2019t have access to hedge funds inside moves, but all they have to do is just pop into Reddit and they\u2019re in our conference room. They know what we\u2019re going to do. They can prepare, they use us to their adv. \n\nBBBY has been one of the biggest set ups I can think of. There were apes in on this early. They told y\u2019all WEEKS ago to get in. Then like clockwork, everyone bandwagoned on the short squeeze thesis post comeup. Yet the short squeeze thesis was KNOWN by the enemy because they have operatives in the sub. How can we win against an enemy with way more resources that knows our every move. It\u2019s almost like it was \u201cvery well orchestrated\u201d to quote Cramer. Almost as if they wanted to fuck us, and littered their own bots in here to juice us on the squeeze.  \n\nA reform has to be done. SOMETHING has to be done. We can\u2019t be ape strong if a share of the apes are actually robots in gorilla suits with camera lenses instead of eyes. We need our element of surprise back.",

RC news + CFO unloading all their shares... was the confirmation of a WINNER in this battle. I've realised losses of 4000$.\n\nThey won. So don't be stupid now. I recognise that we had good chances to replicate GME (as the underlying asset doesn't matter, rather a strong retard movement) but after yesterday's events... its time to come back to reality and take the following lessons:\n\n1. There won't be a GME case again - that was unique as it was the first time Wall Street and the world was witnessing such a magical retard movement\n2. GME happened during confinement where we had no other option to become part of something bigger\n3. But the insiders unloading all their papers in the peak of the share price means that we all were buying those papers from their hands... They humiliate us publicly. Cramer won.\n\nIf you can unload at the current level... do it. If your proud won't allow it, than hold if economically you can afford it. But don't expect, not even dream, a x10, x20, x100 return. \n\nGame Over.\n\nSad to say but it's time to go back to rationality. I am shorting SP and Nasdaq as winter in Europe is gonna hit the whole world - and sutpid americans always, always, underestimate the rest of the world until it blows in their face. Your optimism in Wall St. is a joke. September and October will bring a crash in the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a financial advice, just trying to become rational again.",

Don\u2019t be apart of baggage claim. \n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t know anything about stocks. I have done only a small amount of research to play the meme stonk and made WAM from 10 shares. So now that\u2019s out of the way and you have already called me paper hands hear me out. It doesn\u2019t take much to understand that in todays world, the news cycle is so much quicker. Right now the only people still in are baggage claim are trying to convince a bunch of other people to buy their bags. Here is the reason your not going to make that work. The people that will listen are already hodl with you. The retail traders and the people that blew up the stock(such as myself) are gone and probably walked away with at most a minor loss. This was nothing more than a meme stock that people hoped would be another gme. Now that the news is out that RC sold regardless of it being in chunks while the stocks climbed, means that the people who actual day trade for a living are no longer going to care. So that\u2019s 2 major parties gone. So now what you have is the dreamers who are in denial of being baggage claim. What does this mean for you if you are still yolo. You can either sell for a loss assuming you bought in after $10. Or you forever hodl until another set of perfect circumstances trigger a gamma squeeze or in this case a pump and dump. If I knew more I would consider this almost a case of insider trading, but there NO way RC could have know prior that it would be pump and dump.",

What I'm seeing right now is that RC sold his shares but when he did the price didn't drop, it only started to drop like crazy in the AH when most of the Apes cannot sell so there is other people at play there.

Typcally markets love a split congress as it creates more gridlock and stocks are more constable to move slower. 1 month after the midterms you see a rally. Then it ranges to general elections, following the general elections, New promises,  new spending , lower rates , will once again set up a massive bull run. \n\n2024 GME calls..",

    "title": "Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares. Found the Form 4 through sec.gov.",
    "selftext": "There it is regards. Ryan Cohen was considered an insider when selling his $BBBY shares. [\\[Link here\\]](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189522002498/xslF345X03/form413351002_08182022.xml) Now this confirms the swing rule or whatever the fuck it was called, where a portion of his profits will go directly to $BBBY's balance sheet. As well as, this considers the theory that Ryan Cohen sold his shares so GMERICA, GME or even RC Ventures can make a purchase of $BBBY or BABY without conflict of interest. Fuck you shills and Coke Rat Cramer. $BBBY no bankrupt, $BBBY squeeze imminent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 4,500 $BBBY shares @ $18.85 average\n\n[As you can see, here is the Form 4 filed with the SEC. ](https://preview.redd.it/0qoj60wm6yi91.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=991f5cae0a835757d0572fa3e321fe8957e03970)\n\n***edit:*** This also means $BBBY won't be declaring bankruptcy in the next two weeks with their end of the month announcement or else Cohen would be charged with insider trading due to him being an insider. Get fuked shills.\n\n***edit 2:*** For you shills saying that he still wasn't an insider. Heres a [link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form4.asp) to the purchase of the Form 4 for the SEC. It is ONLY REQUIRED FOR INSIDERS.\n\n***edit 3: WHY THE CFO SOLD AS WELL.*** He sold 50K shares and still has 200,000 shares. He scheduled this sale since April 2022. Link [here](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/static-files/175d0b22-a3b2-45a5-b295-0176a4b527af). Check the footnotes in the document to see he scheduled it two quarters ago.\n\n***edit 4: Even if swing rule is wrong.*** If the swing trading rule is wrong so what? Cohen would still be an insider and can\u2019t sell shares if they are declaring bankruptcy in a week or two \ud83e\udd23. Completely destroys the bankruptcy FUD campaign against $BBBY.\n\n***edit 5: Found a form 3 filed in April 2022.*** This confirms Cohen has been considered an insider since April 20-fucking-22. Link [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000119380522001197/xslF345X02/e621885_3-bbby.xml)\n\n***edit 6: $BBBY can clear debt with sale of BABY.*** Let's assume Cohen is buying BABY from $BBBY. In Cohen's letter to the $BBBY board in March 2022, linked [here](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf), he states that BABY alone is worth multiple billions. So if he buys BABY from them it would almost clear their entire debt load if not they might have extra cash if it sells for over $3.3 billion and allow for them to fix the company.\n\n***edit 7: $BBBY looking for buybuyBaby buyers.*** [Heres](https://www.retaildive.com/news/bed-bath-beyond-talking-with-suitors-for-buybuy-baby-wsj/622606/) an article from April 2022, shortly after Cohen bought in stating that $BBBY was in the looks for a buyer.

    "title": "BBBY: ALL or NOTHING",
    "selftext": "EDIT: Someone just found RC's form 4. He was confirmed to have made an insider trade. This means bankruptcy is almost 100% off the table.\n\n\n........\n\n\nBBBY has just become the degenerate regard wsb play of the month and potentially of the year and let me explain why. (TLDR and position at the end)\n\n\n1. ALL or NOTHING\n2. Price Analysis\n\n\nBy now everyone and their mother know RC sold his shares this past week. Although shorts and gay bears immediately started cheering and dancing on the graves of BBBYers, it doesn't mean the end yet.\n\n\nTwo possible theories to what happened and what is gonna happen in the next week.\n\n\n-ALL: either RC reached an agreement with BBBY and BABY gets sold, this theory is already explained well enough in another post so I'm not gonna go further into it.\n\n\n-NOTHING: or BBBY will announce that they are filing for bankruptcy, this theory is backed mainly by BBBY's strapped financial situation, they have been burning through cash and might not be able to service their future debt.\n\n\nHowever I want to share my opinion on why bankruptcy theory might not hold up.\n\n\nRC has been building his image as an activist investor over the last couple of years, activist investors often rely on going public with their demands. Basically his goodwill with retail investors would be a far more valuable asset compared to the few millions in profit he made while selling his shares. RC is a smart man and would definitely consider this. The man who turned his $78m stake in GME to over a $1B can't be that shortsighted to just dump for less than a $100m in profit. Mind you he is probably worth more than $5B.\n\n\nFurthermore the letter on august 18th \"in response to media inquiries\" by BBBY mentions they had reached a constructive agreement in march basically telling investors to not panic and wait for the announcement. It seems weird to publish this letter if BBBY was really going bankrupt. What purpose would it serve then? They are telling shareholders to have faith and wait for the announcement.\n\n\nI want to touch on the price of BBBY. After Freeman and RC sold a combined 17% of the stock it still held steady @27 until the news broke, not once but twice. What is remarkable is that most of the action was in after hours, while there was almost no movement during market hours. We also know that a majority but not all degenerates don't actually have acces to AH. We have already seen with HKD and other Chinese IPO's this past week that low liquidity and low float stocks can be easily manipulated. This leads me to believe that there are still a lot of people holding and that it can still be saved.\n\n\nRight now the price is slightly below $10. Before the rally it was slightly below $4. I can see more people jumping back in if it dips any lower on monday. Especially with the stock still being heavily shorted and being on RegSHO many people still believe.\n\n\nTLDR: Buy BBBY and in 10 days you will either lose it all or you will be part of the greatest space exploration mission ever!!\n\n\nPosition: 230 BBBY shares @12.98",

    "selftext": "I lost a few hundred on BBBY thanks to a put hedge.  If the posts are true, some lives have been temporarily ruined.  The supply of vigorous hand jobs behind Wendy's is at an all time high, and the only buyer is RC himself.\n\n\nFellow Apes, bots, and Cramer backed infiltrators; recognize P&amp;Ds for what they are.  Apes, you're not getting 20X, you'll be lucky to get 4X or nothing.  Recognize this.  If it's an acceptable risk go for it.  I did.\n\n\nHere's the anatomy of the WSB P&amp;D:\n\n\n1. A slew of posts about stock BBBY being primed with a lot of awards.  The awards are showered on positive replies and the OP.  The awards are unusually spread out and varied - not just the free awards. These are the Pumpers.\n\n\n2. Screenshots of Apes buying in, more awards, BBBY starts climbing the mention boards, BBBY starts popping up in the \"reasonable\" subs.\n\n\n3. Lots of posts about why BBBY is going to moon.  Dumb ass reasons, apes start debating.  Rallying cries like \"RC is with us\".\n\n\n4. Screenshots of BBBY being up 2X.  Lots of \"get in on the ground floor.\"\n\n\n5. Posts about BBBY overwhelm everything else, stock starts climbing exponentially.  Legends start emerging (looking at you watermelon fucker) and paper gain screenshots are everywhere.  Icons like the watermelon become badges of honor.\n\n\n6.  BBBY actually moons (like 4X -5X).  Apes start shot calling 20X or whatever.  This is where the regards step in and buy.  Lots of GME 2.0 posts.\n\n\n7.  BBBY dips as the Pumpers sell.  Apes declare war, angry posts about paperhands, tons of hopium.  Pumpers tell people to keep buying for dumb ass reasons that have tons of awards (RC filing to SELL is bullish).\n\n\n8.  BBBY rallies a bit as the \"true squeeze\" happens.  The last of the Pumpers exit and buy puts/increase short positions.  Posts about double down against the shorters, lots of conspiracy theories about ladder attacks and such.  Apes experiencing max fear and hope at the same.\n\n\n9.  Pumpers unleash the FUD Kraken.  Real or not, the effect is real, and BBBY tanks.\n\n\n10.  Present day WSB.  Arguing, loss porn, demands for change, diamond hands, told you so posts, continued hopium reasoning.  \n\n\nI hopped on the BBBY train at $18, sold some going up to $25, dipped back in a bit at $18, then ultimately lost a few hundred and exited at $13.  I truly hope BBBY moons and the apes win, but our assholes are sore and we can only take so much.  I've still got a 0.8 fractional share I couldn't sell after hours, passing that shit on to my son in 2099.\n\n\nHang in there my dudes.",

    "selftext": "I've been seeing comments referring to BBBY as a *deep-value* play.  It could be one.  I think it's worth reviewing one of the most important tenets of deep-value investing.\n\n***What is deep-value?***\n\nTo quote *Deep Value* by Tobias Carlisle (one of the best books on the subject):\n\n&gt;Deep value is investment triumph disguised as business disaster.  It is a simple, but counterintuitive idea: Under the right conditions, losing stocks - those in crisis, with apparently failing businesses, and uncertain futures - offer unusually favorable investment prospects.\n\nIn other words: Deep-value is uncovering an equity the market *thinks is dead equity*, but isn't dead ***just yet*** in reality.\n\nFind a variant perception ***AND*** be right.  That's the essence.\n\n***What is the number-one rule of deep value investing?***\n\n&gt;**Equity. Must. Survive.**\n\nIn true deep-value situations you aren't simply trying to outsmart other equity investors.  You're also trying to outsmart bondholders.  The real vulture-capitalists.  In bankruptcy the bondholders get everything and equity goes to zero.  I'm sure private-equity would love to keep *Buy Buy Baby* out of equity's hands.\n\n***This brings us to the main question of this thread: Will BBBY equity survive at current levels?  Or is dilution, or BBBYQ, coming?***\n\nThere are some possible clues BBBY equity could be in trouble:\n\n* Ryan Cohen's exit\n   * If we took Occam's Razor to Cohen's exit: an easy explanation could be he simply felt equity was in jeopardy and used liquidity as an opportunity to exit.  Simple as that.\n   * Remember, in the case of GME Cohen *beat* the bondholders by raising cash.  Maybe he simply couldn't win this time?\n   * Cohen's BBBY stake is also small relative to his net-worth.  I find it hard to believe he would sell-out and damage his reputation if he felt equity would languish for awhile.  *What if he thought the equity* ***might go to zero***?  I'd be thinking fuck these vultures, I'm out.  He plays the game to win.\n      * Cohen's thesis that BBBY management are idiots might have been correct.  Cohen's thesis that equity has value could have been wrong at the same time.  Smart investors change their position when the facts change.\n* [BBBY CFO selling](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000162828022023266/xslF345X03/wf-form4_166085630266128.xml).\n   * Gustavo probably knows BBBY equity better than anyone on the planet.  Why was he also selling this week?  In deep-value this sets off ***MAJOR*** alarms.\n* [BBBY is reportedly behind on payments to suppliers.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-19/some-bed-bath-beyond-suppliers-halt-shipments-on-unpaid-bills)\n   * This could also tie-in to the CFO selling.  What's Gustavo seeing?\n* Management's failure to do a spot/overnight secondary offering despite the easiest liquidity in company history.\n   * If management cared about shareholders why didn't they **smash the fucking secondary?**  Is BBBYQ the plan?\n\n**Disclosure:** I currently have no position in BBBY as of yesterday.  I'm just trying to encourage discussion.  Bulls, come meet your contras!",

It started out with a 1,000 share purchase at $10.70 and devolved into a crap ton of options trades, some that really worked out, and others that did not. Wednesday near the close I purchased another 1,000 shares. 500 for $19.50 and 500 for $18.90. I wound up getting nervous and dumped 500 for $20.25 and 500 for $20.01 in Thursday's premarket. Thursday after-hours I was feeling pretty good with the stock at $18 and change. I look away from the computer for a minute, then look back. The stock was falling... 17... 16... I come back to WallStreetBets to see the filing of RC selling everything. I was able to sell my remaining 1,000 shares for $14.50. Unfortunately, I had a bunch of $25 and $45 strike call options, but also a bunch of $10.50 put options. I lost thousands on the call options, but made a few bucks on the put options. All in all, I walked away with money in my pocket.\n\nMy original purchase was to make up for missing out on GME. I saw so many similarities, right up until RC sold his entire position. Yes, he had an 8-figure reason to sell, but he already has plenty of money, so I figured he got out while the getting was good.

    "title": "Some advice for the BBBY",
    "selftext": "Well well well history repeats itself and I see another wave of bagholders. Well as a fellow WSB tard here are some advice for you dumb shits so maybe y'all will lose less money in the future. Here are the 4 most sacred rules of WSB:\n\n1. There is no 'we' in trading. No shit. There's only an i. Trading, investing (lol let's be honest no one do that here), gambling. See anything common? Yes they all got an i. Cuz this shit is essentially a zero some game, buy low sell high to the next retard, rinse and repeat. This applies to all stocks, ETFs wtv(options are different those are buy high sell worthless). \n\nThe only difference is who the retards are. In the case of GME citadel ate a bag of shit by selling low and buying high. In BBBY you tards shouting hold and buy and to the moon essential bought high from Cohen lol. Even if the stocks do moon, if you don't cash it out it's worth shit. Better pray you can cash it out to the fomo ppl. Probably why ppl can write pages long DD hyping the stock. They already bought low and need to convince you to buy it from them. Name of the game, move the money from the retards pocket to your pocket.\n\n2. Trust no one. Literally. Trust no DD, trust no Billionaire, trust no news outlet, trust no government, don't trust me, don't even trust yourself. Why? There's no free lunch in the world. As I said it's a zero sum game. Hedgies can hire ppl to write shit in Reddit to pump the stock. The people who writes the DD obviously already bought the stock. By the time you read it, it's probably late. You might ride it up and profit along the way, but ultimately they got a much lower cost basis than you do and can afford to sell their shit earlier. Add on: you guys think billionaires like Ryan are on your side? You mad? All the rich ppl didn't get rich by being kind and generous. They are all ruthless businessmen. There's a higher chance of you getting screwed by them before they even help you poors lol.\n\n3. \"Sticking it to the hedgies\". Lol what can I say. You guys know hedge funds aren't all just short stuff right. And they certainly don't work in coordination with each other. For wtv hedgefund that's shorting shit, you can bet there's another one going long. They're all trying to screw each other. The only difference between the hedgies that go long and you retards, is that they know when to sell, while you Dumbos just ride it up and back down.\n\n4. Inverse WSB. Yup the unspoken rule. The most important one. The one that even if you ignore all the rest of it and just work on this rule. You'll loose less money. You might not make any money still, but at least you loose less. Eg. When WSB was in full retard mode when BBBY was 30. If you bought puts, you'd be in the green (ok maybe not cause of the high IV but at least you lose less).\n\nThat's all folks happy WSB experience. Also you might be wondering by would I bother to write this, must be a hedge fund shill. Lol no, as I said there's no free lunch, writing this encourages y'all to stay here so that I can inverse you lot :P jk",

    "selftext": "First off I don\u2019t hate you. I\u2019ve been a bear since 2021 and going to be a bull in the near future. If there is one thing I have learned is the house always wins. You guys are a bunch of degens at an online casino. Hey, so am I. When you buy a stock that is being short squeezed it is only valuable while you hold the stock above its float. They learned their lesson last time with gme and amc. What they do primarily is covered shorts and puts. I know a fair amount of the hedge funds have naked shorts that do not have an expiration, however that doesn\u2019t matter. They know we hate Cramer and he\u2019s playing you shorty. They can make money off a short squeeze by buying stock before closing their short and put positions. This allows them to make money on their short as it continues to rise. This can be coordinated or uncoordinated it if many institutions have the same goal the manipulation game is obvious to allow it to go up a absurd number sell the newly acquired stocks at mass while acquiring new put positions at a higher strike or similar to capitulate people into selling/rinse and repeat. They can do this forever. Rinse and repeat. The stock has no value and unfortunately is an unorganized \u201c Ponzi\u201d (not technically). I just hope you guys take educated risk. Yes, some of you will make a crap load of money but most of you won\u2019t. Get rich quicks are hard to come by and look at your life. Are you the kind of person to be that lucky?

But by the time that happened, the damage had already been done.\n\nConsidering the mainstream awareness, that insane gamma ramp, the shorts refusing to back down, RC as the figurehead inspiring irrationally positive sentiment, the risk-on market mood, I'd say had RC not sold, BBBY would've gone to $40 EoW, and probably peaked at $100 in the next few weeks. \n\n\nTLDR: THAT WAS AN INTERESTING WEEK. LOTS OF SQUEEZES WANT TO BE THE NEXT GME, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE. THIS ONE FELT LIKE IT MIGHT BE THOUGH. HOW HIGH WOULD BBBY HAVE GONE HAD COHEN NOT SOLD?",

He placed 2-3 board members and replaced the CEO, so I'd say there's an extremely high probability that he was acting on material, non-public information during his quick and very timely exit.\n\nWhat can the NFT marketplace do that's truly innovative and could provide a wide moat for GME? Here are the best rebuttals that I have found against the thesis that the NFT marketplace will be successful:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii6n73n/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii6n73n/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii61kh6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii61kh6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii6ydyg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii6ydyg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii64w2y/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wbayv5/comment/ii64w2y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nLet's say that the NFT space is still nascent (although it's 5 years old tech and $rypto is 13), it still needs time to grow and a strong player to bring it into the mainstream, but GME has like 5-6 quarters of cash runaway left, where free cash flow continues to reduce at historical rates of 46.2% each year and is currently sitting at -772M per year. What then? Declare bankruptcy or issue more shares?\n\nEDIT:\n\nSome possibly less important questions that came to mind:\n\nWhat do you think about GME having their NFT marketplace transactions refutable? Where art was stolen from somewhere else from the internet, taken down from the marketplace, and buyers not compensated?\n\nWhat do you think about the NFT marketplace being powered by Loopring and its appallingly immature team ([link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/rtibt6/whats_with_the_backlash_against_the_very_big/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) and the fact that their relayers are centralized and, rumored, fully based in China?

    "selftext": "This needs to be said, fuck both of them. Downvote if you want to but hear me out.\n\nRyan Cohen as you know rug pulled us on BBBY, he rug pulled anyone that was behind the stock and all the apes, the apes that also helped him gain a lot of money on GME. We helped him squeeze GME and we helped Ryan Cohen get extremely rich by squeezing GME to the moon and our repayment? He leaves any apes that also were still behind him with the bag.\n\nTo be clear, he could have also rug pulled DFV, everyone wants to look at him as some sort of hero like wow this guy is amazing. He wasn't, he was a random guy that got lucky, it could've been any of us on any stock from BBBY to  other meme stocks that were up over 3000%  that I can't name since the bot told me not to lol - the point being that yes DFV made money, good on him, but he didn't get rug pulled by Ryan Cohen who had over 9M shares, not a measly 200K.\n\nYet, people rally behind DFV when he held almost none of the float compared to Ryan. Ryan was the hero behind GME, and he would have been the hero behind BBBY but he fucked us over and now I personally think it's time to fuck him over.\n\nI sold all my GME shares today, which wasn't much but every share counts. All the apes need to send him a message saying we're done with him, we're not here for his pump and dumps, we're not going to allow some billionaire who doesn't even need the money to pull the rug on us just so he can get richer.\n\nSo yeah fuck GME I'm done with it, with that said, why am I angry at DFV? Well, he wasn't the hero we needed and anyone who thinks he was with his 200k shares can go get fucked, but more so, DFV should stand behind the apes and say fuck Ryan Cohen if he wants to be the true hero.\n\nUs apes are literally who helped make DFV rich by buying GME and helping his shares go up higher and higher while he held calls, well, that and not being rug pulled by Ryan like we were, but with that said we were a huge driving force behind making DFV rich, and now it's his time to help the ones who made him rich and he hasn't said a word since 2021, it's time for him to buy BBBY and stand behind the ones who made him rich.\n\nWe were there for him when hit net worth was under 1M and buying GME to help boost him higher, and now that we're being slaughtered by the same fuck that helped him get rich, he is nowhere to be found.\n\nIs that the kind of hero you guys want? If so, you can have him, but until I see him take a position and stand behind the ones that helped him get rich, fuck the dude.\n\nTo end this, I have only around $10,000 worth of exposure to BBBY and my account is over 80k, I didn't go all in, I'm regarded but I also don't think I can continue to give BJ's behind Wendy's until my herpes sores heal (yes RC was the one that gave me herpes), so until then I have to keep some money.\n\nSo no, I didn't have enough to change my life and I didn't have enough to care if I lost, but I did see a lot of other people get rug pulled and lose everything or a lot by a billionaire, and I also see the man everyone loves here DFV remain quiet and not do a thing to help the same apes that helped him get rich, so that's why I am writing this.\n\nTLDR: fuck them both. Stop dick riding a guy you never met, he never gave you money or did anything for you. Quit being a reddit dick rider for millionaires that don't care about you.",

Currently hodling 16 gme @ 30ish avg post split, 30 bbby avg 18.68. This is an important number so we will come back to it. I\u2019m a longtime lurker who is also a lifetime gamer. As an only child I was bored a lot of the time as my blue collar family worked to keep a roof over our heads, but gaming was always there. Then I met a friend who also liked to game and who was also an only child. We hit it off and battled at everything we ever did up until 2019 when he would unexpectedly pass away due to a tragic accident. This one is for you Rich, YOLO.\n\nThis post is all pure speculation and is def not trying to scare you into holding my very manageable bags that I currently hold. I\u2019ve always enjoyed a poker game and right now my opponent has been trapped and I\u2019m holding the royal flush. They are in the tank and have been stalling for the better part of 2 years while I\u2019ve stood on the side lines and watched this thing pan out. I\u2019ve tried to call the clock on them to force them to finally act and they keep using their time extension chips, well they are finally out of those and time is up. They look super strong, this usually is a misrepresentation of strength. Not that it matters cause I have the stone cold nuts. But they grab all their chips and slam them into the pot. Snap call. Thanks to all that have held through to this point cause you\u2019re the real hero\u2019s of this story. The Jedi amongst us has smelled out their tactics to manipulate the weak.  He knew exactly how to get them. He moves away from the force and wild speculation happens about an apparent grifting of the loyalists to the force. You\u2019ve been trapped dark lords and now you\u2019re in the cage with me and I\u2019ve got a royal flush. This is when I go for the home run and show no mercy.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading I\u2019ve got some actual theories about what\u2019s happened here this week. A couple weeks of run up lead us into Tuesday, when said Jedi goes through the proper, transparent channels to step away from the force. Stock goes up, who is buying?! the stock continues to sell for another day. Liquidating the entire portfolio the jedi had been holding, crazy  amounts of volume on both days. A silly, failing towel company shows up regsho on 8/16, as of 8/19 they were still on there. Interesting, could it be all that fomo that was created on tues cause some market participants to go skinny dipping? tsk tsk rules for thee, but not for me?! Cause it was unlike I\u2019ve seen in quite a while. Everyone\u2019s all in and then bam, the Jedi pulls a fast one and turns to the dark side. Or are these just speculations much like this post and we really don\u2019t know what the Jedi is doing.\n\nAt this point you know the Jedi is Ryan cohen, the dark side is citadel and co and the apes are the loyalists in the story above.  Now let\u2019s try to sort this mess out. The amount of fomo was insane on wsb that day when cohen started selling. Real or not real it was wild, Lambos, \ud83c\udf49, pictures of 2m yolos. Continues until 8/17 when the AH articles come out that indeed cohen had liquidated his entire portfolio, which he absolutely did, through the proper channels. The fud that comes out after is a slew of talking heads and hit pieces slinging accusations to scare everyone, including one that stated bbby taps Kirkland Ellis to help address their debt load. \n\nWelp, that\u2019s pretty ambiguous and with the current state of fear about cohens exit, one could speculate bbby is closing their doors. \nNow in AH, when retail isn\u2019t really playing the game, we get a huge run off and the fear goes all through Friday. People who bought the top of Wednesday are now in rough rough shape and the fud is levels I\u2019ve never seen. Cut to a nice piece by the corporate mouthpiece that \u201can expensive towel company\u201d with absolutely no value, who recently filed for a restructing firm to come in and help with their debt load, is now having shipments halted cause they can\u2019t pay their short term debt obligations. Interesting timing on that one just after close again, no retail playing the game real and we slip sub 10. Everyone is going into the weekend confused and scared about their portfolios if they have any bbby exposure.  Do I realize a 60% loss, reset my chess board and move again or do I hodl. \n\n\n\nWell I\u2019ve got an idea that maybe Ryan cohen isn\u2019t some dipshit rug puller, who would 100% face jail time if he sold his entire portfolio and two weeks later have bbby announce bankruptcy, this being because he was a declared insider. I see you RC. Get out of the way so it\u2019s retail vs citadel in what will for sure be their deathmatch. There can be no finger pointing that retail worked as a coordinated effort cause everyone is in a complete tailspin and some lost their shirts in this battle. Ryan what\u2019s that you\u2019ve been diligently working on for the past several months with bbby? spinning off the only profitable piece of bbby, buy buy baby. A spin off that you\u2019re venture capital firm saw as some DFV hidden under the hood of a giant mess that was a Dinosour and didn\u2019t have the right management to see its full value, for the shareholders. Well you come in and buy your stake, get a few top M&amp;A executives in there and get to work. A special committee is formed of two of those members and mr cohen himself to work on these projects. Interesting, a spin off baby would potentially fetch a billion or so on the open market and potentially help service the debt load to the original parent company, bbby. Idk how it\u2019s going to pan out but i think I\u2019ll just hold now. Gets me thinking what if every bbby holder gets 1 share of the spin off and that has a valuation of 1b. Well i\u2019d still hold bbby,for whatever that train wreck sells for after they unload the only dfv left in their portfolio. But I now own a baby worth $1b/79m outstanding. That\u2019s 12.67 for baby plus I still hold bbby. That would be sweet cause I\u2019m in for 30 at 18.68 atm so I think I\u2019ll let this play out. The rest is for you to decide. But I know what I\u2019m about to do. Thanks for maximizing my shareholder value Mr. Chairman. \n\n\nTLDR: I didn\u2019t hear no bell. Gotcha Jim. This one\u2019s for you Rich. I\u2019m arrrrrrrr innnn. \n\nOh and Kirkland Ellis do alot more than bankruptcies.",

    "selftext": "\n\n1. The market environment that was needed for a squeeze are just not present.  When free money, hyperinflation was present, retards could afford billboards and planes.  Today market conditions are not present for such type squeeze. You have what about 2-4  weeks before 2  rate hikes come through? 75 bps or 100 bps this only means that the cost of borrowing will increase. The 80$ price target if it ever gets there and highly likely not,  is  peanuts compared to the 2021 squeeze plays. \n\n\n\n2.  There is just not enough retards with enough money  anymore .  It use to be the case, but most rich gamblers have already lost plenty trying to chase the 100000000 countless other stocks you all tried to pump.  Rememver RKT ? Clov ? SNDL ? SPCe ? More and more....  ahh these where good times. Many people who have a mortgage gotta renew with higher interest rates, many with debt gotta pay it back with higher interest rates. Many of you who have a job, likely aren't all that secure,  knowing your boss everyday is thinking if he should fire some of you.  This is the cycle of printing money, this is the cycle of an economy contracting. \n\n\n\n3. There is not enough institutional gamblers, mostly for reason #1 and #2\n\n\n\n4. BBBY is  a rather boring failing  business.  It isn't games nor movie, things you remember when you were a child.  BBBY  has less emotional ties to its shareholders. Who the F cares about bathroom crap..\n  If WSB was a bunch of moms and maids i would say we have a shot, most of you never clean your dirty filthy bathroom. Do you even shower? Living in moms basement  do you even own the rights of that bathroom ?. You will not convince teenagers to hold Bbby , you can convince them to hold  games and movies.\n\n\n\n\nRemember when the price target for gme was  suppose to be over 1000$ ? Which ever dumbas believed that held on.  Those who were smart sold when it was few hundred dollars.  Bbby price target is 80$ .... lol thats a joke, people will continue selling much before what retards on here try convincing you about a PT.",

    "title": "Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial at best and UTTERLY RETARDED at worst.",
    "selftext": "A lot of people don\u2019t understand how valuations work still. The real reason BBBY is worth nothing is not because of it servicing debt. It pays a measly 70m a year to service that debt. It\u2019s because its operating margins are garbage + revenue is shrinking (sign of imminent death). A business can lose money, shrink in size, and still be worth something, but once you issue debt, you are no longer in charge of deciding whether to burn your business and asset value down at your own pleasure. Creditors can and will sue to make sure you stop burning cash so they can liquidate the company\u2019s assets \u201cAT THEIR DISCRETION\u201d. Even if they magically get a 1x sales valuation on BABY, all that would do is remove their debt, and it would be IMPOSSIBLE to get any more loans after that. Meaning the literal first quarter they have negative enterprise value the company is officially worthless.\n\nThat\u2019s assuming they get the 1x sales for BABY. CHWY, a fresher and more obviously eCoMmErCe face, has a valuation of 2x sales. And that\u2019s with continued growth potential, HIGH HIGH chance of cost optimization once they reach peak growth, and much more niche retail area. Now compare to BABY which is literally 2 decades old. Probably showing minimal growth. And most importantly, the name is going to be negatively perceived by the market 1) because they\u2019re associated with a dying name 2) associated with the HF/big money fucker RC (most big equity names and PE bros hate him for the GME debacle) 3) attached to a highly leveraged owner who they can under bid. Might be hard getting more than 0.5-75x sales for that\u2026\n\nRegardless, GME DOESNT have the money, and if they barely did, it would cause THEIR value and ALSO RCS SHARES to decline in value heavily (beyond an initial ape pump which he can not sell). And RC would never put in a billy of his own money, and why would he, IF he also sold out of bbby. Hence gaining no extra value on saving the parent org.\n\nYou can\u2019t just say that IF he did want to buy, he\u2019d maybe have to liquidate. There has to be good reason for him to want and afford BABY. The entire value of selling BABY isn\u2019t because he likes it, it\u2019s because he has \u201cexpertise\u201d pumping an eCommerce asset, CHWY, and the goal would be to utilize stupid valuations to SQUEEZE BBBY. WHICH HE NO LONGER FUCKING OWNS.\n\nThe argument is circumstantial AT BEST. Hope this was helpful.\n\nTLDR: BABY at best is worth a billion, which would cover sure BBBY\u2019s debt. But the company is still worthless and is very close to being force liquidated by its creditors. One billy is more than what GME could afford and what RC would personally buy into, given he\u2019d lose a ton of value on his existing gamestore equity and would gain nothing on the SHARES HE ALREADY FUCKING SOLD AAAAAAAAA.",

Do you remember the bears then? \u201cGME is announcing bankruptcy\u201d, \u201cprice going to $5\u201d it goes on and on and on. But we HODLed.\n\nThis HODLing paid off ~3k in medical bills for me that were in collections and allowed me to build a safety net of savings, I was able to leave my shitty job and go to school full time without worry. As far as I\u2019m concerned, RC had a role in improving my life because a bet on him to succeed with GME.\n\nBBBY holds such a strong asset in buy buy Baby and I am more bullish than I have ever been toward this stock after the amazing DD over the weekend. \n\nA lot of the negative sentiment is coming from 1.) FOMO, 2.) paperhanders who sold last week and are scared to buy back in, or 3.) coke zooted finance bros yeeting their portfolios into puts.\n\nHaving a brick and mortar store in out current economy is like using gas extraction machinery to harness solar energy. It\u2019s not the right tool, we are transitioning to a near full eCommerce market. RC saw this with Chewy and it has honestly been one of the smartest moves I think I have seen in my lifetime.\n\nWhen I think of the future of selling \u201cbaby goods\u201d there is no other answer than Chewy for babies.\n\nBBBY would have declared bankruptcy by now if they were in danger. They would have issued more shares. They wouldn\u2019t be teasing a big announcement at the end of the month.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc9c\n\nPSA: fuck Jake Freeman whoever \u201cthey\u201d are",

    "title": "The GME Anomaly and the Slow March",
    "selftext": "I'm posting this on a burner account because posting from my main would be compromising in a bad way. \n\nIf you aren't familiar, there's a community-created direct registration tracker that has for the last two earnings  accurately anticipated the amount of registered shares. \n\n[The white points represent the official figures from GameStop, with the blue plot being the trimmed average of user-submitted entries.](https://imgur.com/a/eKJuMm5)\n\nAt the time of posting, this tool is estimating that roughly ~48% of GameStop's public float is directly registered. About ~80 million shares are owned by retail investors. And it largely baffles me that more people aren't talking about this. I believe that this is unprecedented (I might go as far as saying that I *know* this is unprecedented). It's uncharted territory. I think I remember doing some napkin math and coming up with an estimate that it would take ~4 years for half of the public float to be registered. This was around the time DTC withdrawal was first discussed in the GameStop forums (maybe in August of last year?), and I think I made the error of assuming that there wouldn't be a kind of memetic contagion (that or I'm terrible at math). \n\nThis is to say: GameStop \"Apes\" are doing something incredibly strange at an incredibly quick, if not near impossible, pace. If this continues (at *this pace*), there is a very good chance that by next August/September the majority of publicly traded shares will be individually registered to who knows how many people. And that's weird. That is enough right there, I think, to re-evaluate the whole meme-stock frenzy. It was for me, at least. I very much wrote off the whole phenomenon until a colleague brought the tracker to my attention.  \n\nIf you want to understand my thinking better: here we have a highly retail-driven instrument that is quickly becoming illiquid. I know social sentiment is largely disregarded as \"soft\", but as evidenced by the last week, it is a salient driver of price action. A *vast* majority of GameStop investors are not selling these registered shares (or at least say they aren't). GameStop's turnover rate has plummeted in the last few months, and intraday volume is miniscule barring extreme/sudden movements. This is independently verifiable with whatever data provider you use. \n\nI originally called it a slow march. \nIt's at least a spirited waddle now. \n\nI anticipate it to increase somewhat, without taking too strong a position in either direction. However, basic newtonian physics tells us two things: it's *really* hard to get a massive object moving, and equally difficult to get it to stop. \n\nI envision a horrific, gigantic ball of monkeys just starting to roll down a hill, with some clueless octogenarian in a top hat right in its path. I hope that's a colorful illustration. \n\nNow, before I get bombarded (not that it matters because I plan to ditch this account right after I post this), I will say a few things: \n\n1. I know for a fact that GameStop will not reach some $xxx million per share. It's completely impossible. Anything else is wishful thinking. Even *if* there are many *n* times the float of \"synthetic\" shares, there is simply not enough money in the world (the entire history of it) to reach those prices. I cannot believe I have to explicitly say this, but here we are. \n2. I do not care about Ryan Cohen. I have no strong feelings in either direction. This post is not about Ryan Cohen. Please, for the love of all that is good, do not conflate this post as being about Ryan Cohen. Please.\n3. I do not own *any* GameStop. No positions, no stake in this. I am making this post purely out of the desire to have discussion on the most popular... financial... forum on this website. \n4. (Final and most important point) the tracker very well may be wrong. We have, what, a week or so? To see if it's still acceptably accurate. I do anticipate it to be, as a model with as much data and previously verified trends as this one to be hideously inaccurate would be highly anomalous. Nothing is impossible, however.  \n\nTake of this what you will. Take care. Be kind. Make money.",

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's shares were down another 6.6% in early trade Monday.**\n\n**Certain vendors have also reportedly halted shipments to the retailer due to lack of payment, while the company is understood to have enlisted the services of law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, with expertise in restructuring and bankruptcy advice to manage its debt load, Bloomberg News said.**\n\n**The company's outlook is deteriorating and may require a major restructuring of its business, Wedbush analysts led by Seth Basham said in the note. The investment firm expects cash burn to remain high over the next two quarters until inventory becomes a source of funds in the fiscal fourth quarter.**\n\n**The retailer's aggressive large-scale promotions suggest another inventory reserve markdown is in the pipeline and with suppliers' hesitance to refill warehouses, \"this could limit the company's capacity to fully tap the $800 million remaining on its (asset-based loan) that is partly predicated on the market value of BBBY's inventory balance,\" according to the analysts.**\n\n**Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is considering numerous financing options, including a potential sale of its Buy Buy Baby business that could fetch between $630 million to $910 million in proceeds and buy the company some time to ease vendor concerns, the firm said in the note. However, it does not \"fundamentally change the negative outlook\" of the retailer's core business.**\n\nM **Pressure is mounting for BBBY to appease vendors, improve cash flow, increase liquidity, and reduce sales declines-room for any mistakes is shrinking,\" the analysts said.

Both in general, and for BBBY.**\n\n---\n\nAs a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. \n\nAs of late, the main complaint seems to be that I \"only\" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. \n\nSo let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!\n\n#FAQ:\n\nQ: Why since August 5th? \n\nA: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. \n\nQ: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)\n\n---\n\n#Methodology:\n\nI took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.\n\nI don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.\n\n---\n\n#Results!\n\nOverall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.\n\n**BBBY Specific - Summarized**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull|7|\n|Neutral|2|\n|Bear|5|\n|Other|56|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n**BBBY Specific - Detail**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull Serious|6|\n|Bull Shitpost|1|\n|Neutral Shitpost|2|\n|Bear Serious|3|\n|Bear Shitpost|2|\n|Daily Thread|32|\n|Unrelated|24|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n\nWhat about those nebulous \"Daily Thread\" and \"Unrelated / Other\" categories?\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull BBBY|5|\n|Bear BBBY|1|\n|Daily|22|\n|Earnings|1|\n|Trash|1|\n|Weekend|2|\n|***Total***|***32***|\n\n**Unrelated**\n\n|**Topic**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bear AMC|1|\n|Bear GME|1|\n|Bear TSLA|1|\n|*Bear Total*|*3*|\n|Bull AMC|2|\n|Bull GME|1|\n|Bull OXY|1|\n|Bull SPY|5|\n|Bull SQ|1|\n|Bull TSLA|1|\n|*Bull Total*|*11*|\n|Education|1|\n|Legendary Post|2|\n|Meme|1|\n|Neutral Wind|1|\n|News|1|\n|Shitpost|2|\n|Tattoo|2|\n|***Total***|***24***|\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis was fun to put together and only took about an hour. \n\nI was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. \n\nI'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.\n\nThere are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. \n\nThis is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)\n\nAnother limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.\n\n---\n\n||Category|BBBY Daily?|Topic|Is Dupe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[\"Buying more BBBY puts Monday lfg\" by thisismyname2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuab08/buying_more_bbby_puts_monday_lfg/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"I don\u2019t want bbby to go bankrupt so I just pulled ...\" by MrSingh_Entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wub13h/i_dont_want_bbby_to_go_bankrupt_so_i_just_pulled/)|Bear Shitpost| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, August 22, 2022\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu8ppj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_august_22_2022/)|Daily Thread|Daily||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares....\" by DatSlattSlimeBooBong](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtju81/ryan_cohen_was_an_insider_when_selling_his_shares/)|Bull Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial...\" by obiwanjustblowme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtnust/why_the_baby_acquisition_premise_is/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Aswath Damodaran - Session 1: Intro to Valuation\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wte3eu/aswath_damodaran_session_1_intro_to_valuation/)|Unrelated| |Education|Not Dupe|\n|[\"Lambo Wen?\" by doublejeopardyalex](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt7agl/lambo_wen/)|Unrelated| |Bear TSLA|Not Dupe|\n|[\"675% gains on 2 BBBY options.

    "title": "AVYA... activist investor, funds loading, ceo on the interview circuit.",
    "selftext": "Yo,\n\nFirst to the mods: this company was a 1.75b market cap company at the beginning of the year, has been crushed and it's mkt cap tanked, but for most of it's life similar to GME it met the mkt cap threshold.\n\nGist: Avaya is a distressed well know brand that has potential for a restructure opportunity, new management has entered the picture and set on  turning things. New CEO Alan Masarek who was the CEO of Vonage  took Vontage from  $3.51 to $10 then stepped away at the peak, so he's not a chode. Here's an article (*published today*)  \\[[New CEO Alan Masarek talks the future of Avaya](https://siliconangle.com/2022/08/22/new-ceo-alan-masarek-talks-future-avaya/)\\] in which he talks about the future for Avaya. Would suggest you read it  since he talks about fixing the capital structure, his plans for modernizing the business, and how Avaya got into this situation. Here's bull porn snippet from the article:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85o7815eyij91.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc752486752b351e8431bdf787a439b3ac27950f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, recently filings show activist investor with twitter fingers hulking shares. August filings also show that other funds have joined the game swallowing shares with such fervor would think  they work for OnlyFans. The net effect of  so much buying is that  reduction of shares is starting to show up in  short metrics.\n\n# Today\u2019s filing [[link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000089924322029450/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)]\n\nDude named King Theodore Walker Cheng-De ( *the activist investor*)  spammed the buy button on Avaya and is now a 15%+ holder. What\u2019s cool about this is that the [original](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522224146/d358952dsc13g.htm) 13g disclosed that he owned 11,432,250 as of Aug 8th. A few weeks later he decides to double dip and get around 1.8m more shares so now he owns 13,231,350 shares . Nice now he owns 15.4% of shares outstanding.\n\nFrom [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) we have the following whales with filings as recent as 8/15 and no later than 8/9\n\n**Vanguard owns**: 9,531,774  - 11%\n\n**Capital World**: 8,369,041 - 9.7%\n\n**Blackr0ck**: 7476,255 - 8.7%\n\n**American Centurry Companies**: 5,950,649 - 6.9%\n\n**Theodore** \\- 12,231,360 = 14.41%\n\nTotal = **43,559,079**\n\nNot going to keep going but just showing that other funds have been ape\u2019ing into shares of Avaya as recently as last week.\n\nSo, we have a stock thats -98% from its 2021 high with a recent vocal activist investor, we have multiple funds ape'ing to Avaya this month, and new CEO and new management. If AVAYA pays off 2.25% 2023 convertible note with the  $221 million in escrow, or if they release a 8k regarding a turnaround plan, or if more filings come out showing that even more tutes are loading it should fly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6k462njyij91.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4699650fe8c7cb22a94130b9aa00b0a88917699e\n\nYou may notice that Avaya market gap is 60million, yet they have $404million of cash on hand, and $221m cash in escrow. They also authorized 147m of buybacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aemto33lyij91.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed8936d9c96d92c2b7f623ccc2bbde9a8434a189\n\nAgain they have a 60million market cap, can see that in 2019 there were talks to spinoff a part of Avaya business for 4billion.\n\n# Why the move today?\n\n(1) The interview with the CEO? (2) Theodore King bought more shares (3) Theodore released a letter 5page letter about Avaya.\n\nCan view Theo\u2019s letter here direct here in the 13g filing: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)\n\nYou can read his thesis for why he\u2019s spamming Avaya aggressively for millions and selling puts. His letter is  instructive, and a better summation than my smoothed brain can manage. If you skim through you\u2019ll see Theo has a PT of $25.\n\nWant more bull porn? Ok fine below see JP Morgan reiterating  $7 PT last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibc1v0qmyij91.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcbe4a06dd47dea25d843fa2b69a03a5d917dd11\n\nThat\u2019s about it. That\u2019s the setup. Avaya's software is very prevalent btw basically every company uses them.\n\n# Hold up wait need the squeeze weather forecast:\n\nCan see above that juicy setup, CTB/ON-LOAN/UTLIZATION increasing, while on-loan avg age is decreasing to flat. So I interpret this as shares being sucked from float making the short metrics rise. In fact, we know that total shares outstanding 85,836,560. If we add up all the shares 6 funds mentioned earlier own we get 43.5m shares. So that's around 50% of shares outstanding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60ljsjynyij91.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fec358aed8a024f8187e2a5a2da05a86941abfb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ho2d4nwyij91.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=793ba172a75279f0b37e389a1253e50869b7b314\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChecking the price and volume can see volume increasing, rsi getting a bit of legs, but more importantly can see we are at the absolutely ground floor, even with Avaya impressive performance on an absolute puke day for the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWrapping things up SI is 20% of float since 15m shares are sold short . Given  that Avaya has 85,836,560 shares outstanding and if we add the 6 funds mentioned early stakes we come to **43,559,079** shares locked up   by tutes. So, let's do some math for the float: 85.837m-43.55m =42.337m. I only did this quickly and roughly there are other holders if you want you can go to [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) yourself and calculate. ***However, given this info can reasonable say that the 36% of float is close to shorted, and kinda of explains the increase in short metrics while the average age of loans is flat - tutes sucking shares away.***\n\nSo to recap the activist investor Theo is active on Twitter (always a plus) check the language below to see why this is good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2wtn92e0jj91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ff6925db89ee3cd4a3a74ef8ad98cc5a31c58db\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in the August 13f's  filings shown that  other firms have also opening up significant positions, solid new CEO doing the media circuit, short metrics solid and juicy, activist investor throwing out a $25 PT and JP Morgan reaffirming $7, lastly Avaya market cap is 60m have 404million cash on hand and 221m cash restricted in escrow and have guided revenue of $712m and have authorized 147m in buybacks. ***You want even more DD?*** Check activist investor Theodore's thesis he posted on google drive *(link:* [*https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eycdOLuup\\_onwAWfMWmu1AgjR\\_68HzPa/view*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eycdOLuup_onwAWfMWmu1AgjR_68HzPa/view) *which is now in the 13g filing* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)*)*.\n\nYou may not realize now, but I this is  a bomb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/59rzo8tvyij91.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Made a mistake in my calculations edited.\n\nwhat;s the mistake?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xid7k0uouyj91.png?width=2764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d98d6c4c8a577ce01fbab68ee9d083d2d16b62f\n\nPRN according to whalewisdom means shares associated with converitble debt, so once the price goes past a certain point holders can exercise. In Theodores letter he states $3.41 is the strike but they can't convert until Oct 1. These guys hedge so they are the ones getting squeezed rn, they can't convert notes to cover the shorts. lol Sheesh the setup is wild.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5gckmepuyj91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a20f68ed406cfae519f58219b481ea676458c1f\n\nAnyway, I excluded these guys from the float calculations and included firms that own 5%+ of shares to come to  a lower number around. In [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wxq7ve/avya_a_look_at_the_new_ceos_compensation_letter/) that looks at CEO compensation/holdings so around 40% of shares are shorted and possibly if we include the estimated short interest now 50%. So I edited the post to include the correct calculations and will be going back to edit the others..",

    "selftext": "Listen,\n\nI know you all in here are too busy worshipping Ryan Cohen, and with bag-holding GME and BBBY. You're flush with APE tokens. But do you want to make some real money? Then you better pay attention.\n\nThere's this car manufacturer called Xpeng. Yes, it's Chinese. Their CEO is a gross little man with a small member (statistically likely), but it's going to make you LOADS of money if you play your cards right.\n\nThis company does not innovate. No! They do what Chinese do best: make second rate copies of stuff but CHEAPLY so even regards like you can afford them. Can you afford a Tesla? I can't, yet. But I absolutely can afford a new Xpeng G9, and do you really think the average regarded gentleman on the street can tell the difference between that and a Tesla? Absolutely not.\n\nUp until now, Xpeng cars were kind of rickety and you wouldn't want to be caught dead driving one on your way to Wendy's. But the X9? Looks like a Tesla, smells like a Tesla, is probably extremely unreliable, just like a Tesla. The X9 auto-pilot is free, and will kill you just as good as Tesla's will.\n\nSo here's the unique opportunity: the G9 is soon going to be released and it's amazing. But the market is currently valuing XPEV like they make the Chinese equivalent of Lada or something. But their new car can easily compete in developed markets like the US and in Europe. Even the French is going to buy them.\n\nXPEV is easily going to 3x by Christmas.\n\nPositions: just get some calls. LEAP:s or, if you really want to go big, something closer to November.\n\nOr you can go back worshipping at the feet of Ryan Cohen, waiting for the...what again?...to occur Any Day Now. Your choice.\n\nPS. Check my post history and you can see I hate China. I am into this play out of pure self interest.",

    "selftext": "The state of the economy can be summed up with one word: erosion. 50% of the working class hate their jobs, 61% are living paycheck to paycheck with no room to breathe, they have little to no option to take their lives in a new direction, 1 out of 5 Americans have zero retirement savings, etc. Basically all the shit Bernie Sanders was talking about and everyone continued to ignore post election. \n\nThere is widespread inequality and everyone is so busy focused on getting theirs that they play into the hands of a greedy system that, in the words of George Carlin, threw them overboard 60 fucking years ago. \n\nNowadays, I can probably guess what\u2019s predominantly on your mind. You likely go around imagining of ways you\u2019ll get rich quickly and free yourself from financial burdens. Ways to quit your fucking job and just be free to make decisions that aren\u2019t strictly governed by money. Let me know if I\u2019m wrong..\n\nThere are many of you on WSB that have lost a lot by chasing this dream and can finally see past the veil with the clarity that devastation brings. Yolo Gains or Yolo Losses, our economy shouldn\u2019t be built on \u201cgo big or go bust\u201d. We do a lot of gambling here, but I don\u2019t think gamblers really defines the people on this sub, I think a more apt term would be dreamers that are more aligned with the anti-work movement. \n\nThroughout all the GME or BBBY posts, what\u2019s glaringly obvious is the financial strain so many of us are in and how desperate we are for a way out. So we wake up early to stare at a little green or red line that determines how we feel that day.\n\nShits pretty fucked up right now, but it\u2019s just money and the more that we don\u2019t get a handle on how to invest in the right places, the right people and businesses that give back to their communities, the longer we\u2019ll play into the hands of a system that siphons resources away from our homes, schools, and local businesses. \n\nIf we can learn to get out of our own way, I think things will work out for the best. Alright I\u2019m done ranting.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been giving this a lot of thought. I\u2019m obviously invested in BBBY and on board for the squeeze so I can\u2019t take some money from these hedge funds that bet against American Business. At the same time now trying to figure out Ryan Cohens End Game. What\u2019s the move, how to really restructure BBBY with BABY along with GME and GMERICA. What can he do to really reach customers across the nation and build a successful long lasting company. \n\nMy idea would be to have a Big Interactive store the same size as a BBBY Store. Catering from Infants all the way to young Adults. With everything they need clothes, toys, games, sports, school supplies, shoes, sports shoes, baby shower/gender reveal supplies, costumes ect\u2026 Also making it like a small size distribution center for online orders. Maybe just have larger items on Display where you walk by and scan with your phone and order it from the larger distribution center. Or can\u2019t find your size scan the tag and order the right size. Keep the clutter to a minimum. Interactive displays or Demos. Have games for kids to play while parents shop. Also to keep the employees working have them pull online orders. Don\u2019t have to stand in line to check out. Pay and free ship right from your phone in store. I don\u2019t know but a lot of great ideas and a lot of money to be made. I believe a store like that could be extremely influential on the next Generation of kids. Hopefully this is RC\u2019s vision.",

    "selftext": "Well it would appear everyone\u2019s favorite/least favorite company will **NOT BE GOING BANKRUPT**. \n\nWith that said, a run up sure looks extremely promising. \n\n**For added pressure, this is also not BBBY\u2019s special EOM announcement-nor have RC\u2019s selling motives been made publicly clear.** \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd14\n\nI think this positive news clearing all the FUD in the air of BBBY going bankrupt has the possibility of carrying some very real momentum that it\u2019s been lacking in the following days. Seems obvious to the majority of us, that most uneasy apes pulled out *only* because they were afraid bankruptcy was almost imminent when RC sold (dick riding the billionaire) &amp; that was a risk some weren\u2019t going to take. \ud83d\udc11\n\n*(Pretty positive a majority of us if-not all of us, weren\u2019t investing for BBBY\u2019s remarkable balance sheets anyways, but that\u2019s an entirely different story people have quickly forgotten.)* \ud83e\udd21\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\nYou all must\u2019ve forgotten what had happened to GME shortly after Michael Burry sold his shares, far too soon. Well welcome to Wallstreetbets- Everyone reacted how they did with RC selling his BBBY shares, they had all assumed that was the end of GME, that it HAD to be going bankrupt. Well guess what? It FUCKING moon\u2019d okay, and it was all people talked about for weeks, years, to this day. Made not only money-hungry Michael Burry look foolish, but every single paper-hand who sold at a loss foolish aswell. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nNow that\u2019s cleared up-all you regards can stop fighting about whose right &amp; whose wrong. \n\n**One thing we can all agree on however is: if you\u2019re playing any side of BBBY, you got massive balls.** \ud83c\udf49\n\nWith a loan close to half a *billion* dollars, with another $150m+ cash on hand, and *maybe* even possible RC + CFO sale proceeds? BBBY now has PLENTY more time &amp; breathing room. They\u2019ve also currently been selling/sold real estate to acquire more funds while actively looking for a buyer for their other spin off company-Buybuy Baby, which by the way, has a whopping estimated value of 1.5 *billion* dollars (Ryan Cohen?GMErica?Dragonfly?) Desperately needing money in the near future does not seem to be an issue for BBBY no longer. Maybe some greater turn around plan is in the works after all. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nSo wait wait wait\u2026the firm they hired, **KIRLAND &amp; ELLIS,** (whose been helping companies since 1909) will NOT be used for bankruptcy as we had thought? Maybe they hired them for something else such as, **restructuring** and **rebuilding** their brand and finances?\n\n**Balance sheets alone did not give this company over a billion trading volume in just a few days, remember this apes**. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nFinances and balance sheets aside, because those never really quite mattered for a squeeze. SI is STILL absolutely sky high on this company-especially with all the (now) false FUD/puts in the last week. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is still one of the most heavily shorted stocks on Wall Street, just about time again to make all those short sellers repurchase their shares and drive this BBBY up further. Officially not going bankrupt and with 1500+ new jobs *currently* listed. OPEX + REG-SHO &amp; at an already impressive 67.31% discount, paired with the current attention BBBY has amongst the media and apes, things are looking *very* interesting. Only time will tell if another, more revengeful, squeeze will be sqoozed.  \ud83d\ude80\n\nRegardless if you\u2019re bullish or bearish on BBBY, you have to admit amongst a sea of bad news, this is **GOOD &amp; reassuring** news for the company &amp; it\u2019s shareholders. \u2705\n\nBBBY\u2019s major sell off/Dip to FUD and RC selling has already happened, so what\u2019s logically next, a possible correction upwards? what other terrible news could even be left? Realistically one of the worst things to drive a stocks price down would be immediate bankruptcy, which is now ruled out. Who doesn\u2019t own 10% of the company to dump anymore? What company is no longer going bankrupt? It sure seems like the major bear hypothesis is gone &amp; now there should be way more buying pressure with way less risk. -20% or +1000% I personally like the sound of those ratios. \ud83c\udf40\n\n**TDLR; BBBY will *not* be fighting bankruptcy in the coming months &amp; will now have cash on hand for a *possible* turn around.**\n\nWhat\u2019s everyone\u2019s thoughts &amp; opinions for a continued squeeze/bull case? \n\nRead the publishing for yourself below~\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-clinches-loan-deal-11661301078](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-clinches-loan-deal-11661301078)\n\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\n\n**SQUEEZE PART 2 INCOMING?** \u23f0\n\n**DID RYAN PAPER-HANDS COHEN SELL TOO EARLY?**\n\n**WE\u2019RE STILL GETTING WATERMELONS!?!?** \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49\n\n#Edit 1: HOLY MOLY!

    "selftext": "Squeeze cuming?\n\nSo this is one I was watching on IPO day. And I\u2019m sure we all seen it fly sky high following that. It has since came down significantly to the point where I started my buying in yesterday and today. I\u2019ve been sitting on my original GME gains for a while to find the right stock to YOLO into. I\u2019ve sold off my boomer stocks to accomplish my goals.\n\nAs of this post she\u2019s sitting at $26.52.\n\nSo here\u2019s the deal, insiders own 48.54% of the share count with institutional shares sitting at only 1.98%. Floats at 3.24%.\n\nThe insiders can\u2019t start shitting on us until after the 180 day lock up period. Giving them incentive to put out some type of good news in the near future. \n\nGross profit margin is at 19.8%, with a 2021 revenue of $414.2M with a gross profit of $89.6M. With revenue up from $275.5M in 2020. It\u2019s a growing business.\n\n7.7m volume today where it leveled off. On a big down day makes me feel like it\u2019s not going lower. And the risk/reward would be great after already pulling back substantially, and the hype just starting on this one, and idk about y\u2019all I like buying stocks while they\u2019re down. (Although I get it\u2026 $BBBY to the moon)\n\nIt\u2019s a Chinese stock and I know lots of people don\u2019t like playing those but money is money to me. And this certainly isn\u2019t a long term hold for me. But if there is a possibility of the next big jump, like HKD, I\u2019ve got to believe this is it. \n\nIn price discovery mode (which is why we buy low) and I\u2019m sure the hedgies have shorted the fuuuck out of it already (hence the massive trading volume)\n\n1. Such low float\n2. Insider lockup for 180 days preventing them from fuckin OUR watermelon!\n3. JD.cum owns a large chunk of it.\n4. International business with offices everywhere, including US\n5. Started in 2006 and they\u2019re sustainable and profitable.\n6. I\u2019ll post a video of me aggressively fuckin a watermelon if it hits $2500 like HKD did. \n\nWhat do you got to lose but money? Trust me bro\u2026 lmao\n\n\nMy position: 50 shares at an average of $32.28. Will be adding many more in the coming days most likely. Havn\u2019t yolo\u2019d yet\u2026 but it\u2019s coming. Just trying to become a millionaire. \nNot investment advice, just posting my thoughts while I poop \ud83d\udca9.\n\nEdit: Vote this up \u2b06\ufe0f if you agree.",

    "selftext": "First to the mods: *this company was a 1.75b market cap company at the beginning of the year, has been crushed and it's mkt cap tanked, but for most of it's life similar to GME it met the mkt cap threshold.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello all,\n\nIt's me doinshit. Contrary to the title, I have been doing shit, research.\n\nCan search around for  [previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wvzo7c/avya_activist_investor_funds_loading_ceo_on_the/) I wrote but I'm here to do a refresher on the float calculations. So hold onto your panties, and get some glue ready to sniff because after this it will be solidify in your head that this is the only play.\n\nTheodore aka \"King\" \"Champ\" \"Besty\" \"Zaddddy\" .... the activist. [Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000089924322029450/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) earlier in the week showed he owns 13.231m shares.\n\nFrom [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) we have the following whales with filings as recent as 8/15 and no later than 8/9\n\n**Vanguard owns**: 9,531,774  - 11%\n\n**Capital World**: 8,369,041 - 9.7%\n\n**Blackr0ck**: 7476,255 - 8.7%\n\n**American Centurry Companies**: 5,950,649 - 6.9%\n\n**Theodore** \\- 12,231,360 = 14.41%\n\nTotal = **43,559,079**\n\nIn total we add all of this up and we have 43.55m shares. Now I go to the latest [10Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000141810022000047/avya-20220331.htm) to find the shares outstanding which is 85.837m. So with this information we have float of 85.837m-43.55m =42.337. This is old news the new information is the new CEO's contract:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fm98l7d5hxj91.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c56f4877352eac91dd60e1a0eae4960fc497980e\n\nWall of text but notice that he received a 4million dollar cash bonus which is to be used explicitly to purchase shares of the Company's stock in **open market transactions. You can view his exact offer letter** [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000141810022000075/ex101.htm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/673j0o77hxj91.png?width=2802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf14ddc5b4880aff11c734157c3aea43865e025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the price after the letter $2 then Avaya dumped hard below $1. If Maesrek is the chad I know he his then he secured shares at an average price of $1. If so thats 4million shares reduced from float.\n\n**Given this we can further reduce float like so 42.337m - 4m = 38.337m.**\n\nNow are my assumptions legit? Well Theordore aka the \"GOAT\" agrees. See his comment in the 13g he [filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm) this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[quote--- \\\\\"based on June 30th 13f filings, very few of Avaya's institutional shareholders have reported reductions in their share holding\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/rs0xchx8hxj91.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae4caf5018ee6d29f95012b570768c20cd6a12b1)\n\nI also  back up what I say without relying on Theodore aka \"da Gawd\": 10%+ holders of any stock have to file within 2days of any transaction given that we haven\u2019t seen these filings would say float is less than what\u2019s reported. For the two 8% holders they would need to file if that level drops below 5%, which they have not yet. Of the 5 holders who collectively have 50% of shares outstanding 2 of them own around 10%+, and the other &lt;10%+; hence the 42.33m float number. I have show justification for 42.33m - 4m = **38.337**m  float calculation based on the new CEO compensation and stipulations in the contract.\n\nWhy does this matter? Well you can read Theo's letter and get a sense of where his mind is at in terms of the shorts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brff3ewbhxj91.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=525c79767ba04f72db0514d8e7fb66d31fc827d0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**However note that official short interest is 15.24m. So essentially I'm saying** Avaya **is 40% shorted.**  Estimated SI is at 20.35 so probably around 50% shorted tbh:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4azke64dhxj91.png?width=368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d93322889f0528b5d7ee259658caa01e3dbea83\n\nFurther, this is relatively new as institutions and Theo have been loading in the past 2months, Theodore  aka \"Money Bags McGee\" actually bought 1.8m shares in the last two weeks. The price action is starting to show the lack of liquidity.\n\nWe see barcoding\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6w6dk5jhxj91.png?width=2810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6621e38dc9613e5659975f7159a93bfbc6eb6c9f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe see wild fluctuations in the CTB\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ix71c3nmhxj91.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d5298e525ea13110fed58e844bfa0ef2cc32c16\n\nAverage CTB ran from 3% yesterday to 109% today, then ended at 13.51%. CTB max is now at 271.88%  two days ago this was at 6%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kqn48pqnhxj91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9b14ac8fb865d6d38fb082afba481458f397c8\n\nCan also see that shares available basically at 0, yesterday over 2million shares available.\n\nSo maybe Theo \"The Oracle\" is right about the synthetic shares and ftds and maybe we are on to something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5nl550rohxj91.gif\n\nBtw here's the [CEO's interview](https://siliconangle.com/2022/08/22/new-ceo-alan-masarek-talks-future-avaya/) about his plans to turnaround Avaya clearly from his compensation letter he has a strong incentive to see the price go Boom Boom.\n\n# Made a mistake in my calculations edited.\n\nwhat;s the mistake?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37mfblwfqyj91.png?width=2764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7151e486db6130973817d3d3c52d888ad1c2b010\n\nPRN according to whalewisdom means shares associated with converitble debt, so once the price goes past a certain point holders can exercise. In Theodores letter he states $3.41 is the strike but they can't convert until Oct 1. These guys hedge so they are the ones getting squeezed rn, they can't convert notes to cover the shorts. lol Sheesh the setup is wild. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2oluc4sryj91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=221b839245847c7fd75c1c78498fd7baea6bf6a6\n\nAnyway, I excluded these guys from the float calculations and included firms that own 5%+ of shares to come to  a lower number around. so around 40% of shares are shorted and possibly if we include the estimated short interest now 50%. So I edited the post to include the correct calculations and will be going back to edit the others..",

    "selftext": "\n\nHate it or love it, that thing rips. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I\u2019m thinking about a few things:\n\nPresidential cycles:\n\nFor like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.\n\nTesla\u2019s trend:\n\nAbsolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I\u2019m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.\n\nNOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:\n\nIt really isn\u2019t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon\u2019s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it\u2019s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don\u2019t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I\u2019d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYou gotta love him. He\u2019s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he\u2019s an absolute savage. I\u2019m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he\u2019s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.\n\nTLDR: Why the fuck haven\u2019t we rallied around Elon when he has supported us when we needed him the most? If you don\u2019t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife\u2019s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS by the end of the year?

    "title": "Why BBBY is Down today",
    "selftext": "   \n\nWhy BBBY is Down!\n\nI sit here holding my shares in BBBY and see everything going for a strong short squeeze, and I am in shock that this stock cannot get squeezed. The information came out last night that the shorted stocks were up form 29.07 million on 07-29-22 to 30.76 million on 08-15-22. This is exactly what we wanted to see, more short interest, yet here the stock is going down this morning. All I can Figure is that the Apes here do not believe that this stock can be shorted or are selling at very little profits or even selling at a loss.\n\nI have read articles here on WSB, saying that there will never be another GME. I just want all you Apes to know that these short squeezes have happened in the past and will continue to happen in the future. Maybe this was the first time it was started my retail investors, but they have happened before. For example, a stock you guys are familiar with, Tilray (TLRY) back in 08-2018 was shorted and went to $300 per share. This was not done by retail investors, but was done institutional investors, still it was done before. So short squeezing stocks has happened in the past will happen in the future. \n\nWhat\u2019s blowing my mind is here we are with a stock shorted over 100% and the retail investor cannot get on board with this squeeze. And you\u2019re not going to squeeze the stock by having it stay in the 9-to-10-dollar range, it has to get up there in the 30-to-40-dollar range plus for it to start to squeeze. By letting the stock price stay at 9 and 10 dollars you are allowing time for the hedge fund managers time to decide if they want out of their short position at a small loss. If they exit their position, they will be taking a loss, but not nearly as bad if the stock goes up. \n\nSo, stop sitting on the fence and stop selling for small profits, a squeeze is possible but only if you buy the stock and hold it, don\u2019t sell it till it make a 500% return or better. Then be ready to reenter the stock if it drops back down again, only this time you will be hold more shares which will continue to drive up the price of the stock and start a real squeeze.\n\nKeep in mind a squeeze has nothing to do with, if you like the company or not, its squeezing the short holder to drive up the price of the stock until they, the short holder is in fact made to buy the very stock they are shorting and drive the price up even more.\n\nI hope this helps to explain what is trying to be done with this short squeeze. Buy and hold, only sell with a big profit and reenter the stock if it goes down and hold more stocks than before and don\u2019t sell for small gains and definitely don\u2019t sell for a loss, you must hold the stock regardless of it going up or down 20 to 50%.",

I don't invest in meme stocks but I think you guys actually have a chance to pull a GME on this. I looked at short interest and BBBY is much larger than GME or AMC, and it seems like the gamma squeeze could actually happen, I think the biggest problem is that for a gamma squeeze to work you need to buy a fuck ton of calls to force MM to buy shares, which forces other MM who are short to cover shares, skyrocketing the price. I mean honestly if we all took 500$ and bought deep OTM or ITM calls for next month we'd pull a GME, but honestly I think this sub is far too divided for that.\n\nIf BBBY hits 100$ I'll gift everyone a fucking reddit medal.\n\nSell the GME and AMC, APE, move to BBBY then we'll sell and pick which stock to *not* manipulate them.

I'm counting on it. Even by reading this far **you are** in the **top** **1%** of idiots who think about whether the [Crayon](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/01/business/01crayon1_xp/01crayon1_xp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp) will be ~~green~~ or red tomorrow. Most don't know or care or have time ~~because they have employment~~. They just follow the trend and listen to CNN. The fundamentals have gotten worse. I don't give a shit what you have to say about that because it is the truth. We are stuck between a [rock](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi) and a [hard](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/us-economy-headed-for-recession-by-mid-2023-majority-of-economists-say/ar-AA11111S?fromMaestro=true) place. If this was a metaphor we've lost a lot of blood and even though the only solution is keeping pressure on the wounds the market has priced in rate cuts.\n\nSurprise surprise, **China** isn't the only house of cards when it comes to [housing](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf) or the handful of other bubbles I could name off the top of my head. Governments of the world are strung out blasting the dealer's phone asking for just a few more hits.. but it's not coming anymore. I don't have a particular catalyst to point to but rather would like to state the ~~apparently not~~ obvious, the economy is dangerously fragile. I'm not saying that BBBY will crash the market ~~even though GME almost did last time~~ but it won't take another global shutdown to shutdown the globe. Funny how 411 seems to be my number but here we are again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nFuck you, learn to read. Current vibe: tree falling in the forest that no one is there to see.  As usual play at your own risk and invest long or trade short. Not Financial advice, this is for entertainment purposes only. SPY 8/31 411P",

    "selftext": "Alright regards, time to do some public service. \n\nTo preface this, i took a huge L earlier on the initial pump of BBBY, and am now out of money to invest more. But i'm regarded enough that if i had the money, i prolly would FOMO in. But i am young and lack the fear of loosing all my money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A 400M loan has been approved**\n\nI see a lot of post and conspiracies regarding why this loan was approved. I've seen stuff like \"they would never approve the loan if they were not 100% sure they would get paid\". \n\nThis is business, they will have complex calculation on what the % chance of it getting paid back is. Imagine this: Your stoner best friend wants to borrow 100$ and will pay back when payday comes. Can you really expect to get your money back, maybe its 95% chance. Companies can do that with 400M size loans. \n\nIn short, the loan is no guarantee they won't go bankrupt. But it does make them stay above waters for presumably another quarter.   \n\n\n\"**RC sold in order for the company to go private\"**\n\nThis is also commonly said in comments.\n\nDon't kid yourselves. RC sold for one reason, and that reason alone. Money! (insert mr.crabs here)   \nLet's face it, RC was smarter than us, he knew when to let go of the stock. I personally did not. \n\nI am not a financial lawyer, but i am sure there is a lot of stuff about insider trading. If RC knew anything, he could not make any kind of trade in theory. \n\nAgain, not saying the company wont go private and go to the moon, but not saying it does either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"Regsho is gonna fuck the hedgies\"**\n\nGotta be honest here, it sound really good. But let's be honest, they dont care about us. Just look at what happened with GME. They literally removed the buy button. All the hedgies propably have intense meetings where they try and figure out how to do something similar. \n\nIf it works as we think, we go to the moon. But it rarely does. My guess is it drives prices a bit up, but i still think its retail thats needed for any kind of rocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"How high can the sueeze theoretically go?\"**\n\nNo one fucking knows. And everyone who says they do are either lying to you, or themselves. Set your own take profit/stop loss marks. You don't need to have them do it automatically, but dont get greedy like i did, and go from +9k -&gt; -2,5k on BBBY. And for the love of god, don't FOMO back in after you exit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, godspeed regards. I hope this will squeeze like crazy, and make a lot of people rich. My early greediness(don't be like me) cost me the ability to still be in on the potential rocket. Just remember, dont become bagholders in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDon't make all the mistakes i did. Don't be greedy, and remember, people are regarded on WSB and just because everyone says x thing will happen, then it does not mean it actually will.",

    "title": "$ZIM - I like owning something profitable for a change. Also: What's happening to $ZIM? Why is there Buying pressure on ex-dividend day? Competition between shorts and longterm investors &amp; little bit of math inside",
    "selftext": "*LATE EDIT - The buying opportunity increases and the general math and setup between shorts and long term investors is staying the same.*\n\n*Otherwise, not even ZIM rezisted to the day so it is lower today along with all the market after that Powell's speech at Jackson's Hole.*\n\n$ZIM has some 12% SI and all shorties have to pay the dividends for the stock they borrow to sell short.\n\nI was expecting to see more shorties competing for the stock yesterday so they avoid this 10% penalty on their accounts. It seems that a lot of them chose to stay short and wait for a lower price today so they can compensate for the loss.\n\nBUT... Also yesterday a lot of long investors have sold so they can pick it up on ex dividend day or the following days. Why would a long investor drop a stock before it pays dividends?\n\nTaxes - Israeli taxes to be precise.\n\nWhile the Israeli Gov. is a great guy owning also the control stake in $ZIM, it also take a 25% cut on dividends paid. So, while the stock is mathematicaly loosing 4.75 as it goes as cash to the investor, the investor only gets 3.60 or so.\n\nSo the best strategy seems to be to sell on the day of record or before (while the stock is up) and buy back the next day.\n\n**All great and smart but now BOTH - shorties and long term tax avoiding investors have to compete for the same stock untill it gets higher.**\n\n**The also need to do it fast - before September 8 when the cash is actually sent to investors' accounts. Long term investors often reinvest the dividends, so after Sep. 8 another boost in price is expected.**\n\n**Shorties have an even bigger problem here: Those 10% loss on paying the dividend is not like having ZIM with 10% higher in exchange. Nope, not by far.**\n\nMath again: The dividend is paid in cash and so is the account penalty for having ZIM borrowed after the day of record. The margin of shorties accounts is 50% at borrowing the stock and 20-30 on mantainance. While a 10% spike in stock would require some 3% up in maintenance margin, a cash dividend payout requires the full ammount - that is some 30% out the 30%. Or 50% if the margin is acepted at 20. Some brokers might accept that as ZIM is not AMC or GME.\n\nIn short:\n\n**ZIM shorties have much vulnerable accounts after yesterday, stronger competition on covering back their position and a short window of opportunity to do so.**\n\n*Late edit - $ZIM was trading higher in pre market, at the time of writing the post. At this moment is slightly lower.*\n\n***This is not DD but discussion. What do you think will happen next?***\n\nIf you are new to $ZIM you might wanna read forward.\n\n**Why $ZIM has a lot of long term investors**\n\nIt is the biggest ocean shipping company listed at stock exchange (NYSE).\n\nIt sells at P/E of 0.90 - meaning that it can buy it self up from profits in just one year.\n\nThe 4.75 USD dividend (10% at current price) is for q2 and 10% boost for q1. By the end of the year they estimate to give out some 20$ in dividends.\n\n**The risk/rewardabout $ZIM**\n\n**Some say they can't boost earnings and dividends because the shipping rates were falling in q2. That is true - shipping rates have fallen during q2. This is the risk.**\n\n**Some say they will make even more money and boost the dividend. Here is why:**\n\n**Every year in this planet, the peak time in shiping is just starting in August and ussually shipping rate are growing until winter. The next 2 quarters a full of shopping seasons like back to school, black friday, Christmas etc. All is generating more demand for shipping so better rates for shipping cargo.**\n\nThey bosted their fleet capacity in the last 2 years and they also have 50% exposure to spot shipping rates.\n\nThat is the biggest exposure in the industry - meaning most of their big cash made last year and this year is generated by the spike in shipping rates.\n\n**The growth story**\n\n$ZIM has aslo invested in AI, GPS tracking technology and something better than QR code, anew scanning tech that will be used in cargo shipping - Look up: DSG, Sodyo and Hoopo. All are start ups with strong international finance backing, with clients and revenue.\n\nI**mportant: ZIM has invested in high growth technology while being a cash cow for investors. Any of those start ups if they hit gold - they bring that gold back to ZIM.**\n\nBut you don't have to wait for tiny revenue every new quarter. They've already earned half of their market value in net profits this year only. **Earning  their own market cap every year.**\n\n**Why I am in**\n\n1.Accountability: Israeli Government owns a key stake in $ZIM. I like that about value stocks. Some supervision never hurts.\n\n2. Hedging: I noticed that every time the growth/tech stocks and the market were doing reall really bad (May, June for example) ZIM was high. It offers also little bit of hedging for all that amazing tech stocksthat I like to think I own.\n\n3. I like to see some profitable earnings for a change :D after this 2 crazy years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

In each and every squeeze stock I\u2019ve been involved in. Every single one of them the company diluted shares in offerings the second the stock started going up. What did BBBY do? They bought shares\u2026.. Then they borrowed 400 million\u2026. When they could have simply just diluted and pushed the bag onto shareholders. Granted\u2026. Yes RC is the one who sold. But. Why then did he put board members? Why the bullish letter? Why sacrifice his followers, the very people who made GME what it was, the very people who shop at GameStop. There is a plan. I\u2019m sure as shit of it. I\u2019m not saying there is going to be a hella announcement at the end of the month. Generally speaking the company is not the one who announces any type of buyout, merger, etc. it\u2019s usually the buyer who announces it. Eg. like how Elon announced he was going to buy Twitter. So I don\u2019t believe this end of the month announcement will be the catalyst everyone is hoping for but I do believe it will be something telling us to \u201cstay calm and hodl.\u201d \n\nSummary: I\u2019m not gonna go balls deep in calls for EOM weeklies, but I am going to buy more shares and just chill.

From my research, I noticed one thing important that seems to be over looked; the type of ownership of the security impacts the regulation timeline in which it must be settled. \n\nPer Sec.gov- Regulation SHO also requires firms that clear and settle trades to take action to close out failures to deliver by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.\nFor short sale transactions, failures to deliver must be closed out by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date. For long sale transactions or bona fide market making activities, failures to deliver must be closed out by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third settlement day following the settlement date.\nRule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver. Specifically, if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. \n\nSince shorts are borrowing the security rather than having ownership, I don\u2019t believe they qualify for the T+35 in Rule 204. It\u2019s my interpretation from the regulations, that borrowed shares on the threshold list instead fall under a different subsection of RegSHO Rule 204 as follows\u2026. Rule 204, generally a participant\u2019s fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.\n\nIn summary, since the positions held by shorts are mostly borrowed positions I believe there must be an allowance of 13 settlement days from the FTDs before the position is forcefully closed by the brokerage. Today was the 8th consecutive trading day being on the threshold list. Given the 13 day rule, 9/1/2022 would be the estimated date of closures beginning on shorts position FTDs.  According to ortex data, the actual number of FTDs has yet to be reported. July29th was the last date reported as of today.  Lots of moving parts going into next week. \n\nLet me know what you\u2019d guys think &amp; if there are any counter points on this matter.\u270c\ud83c\udffd",

    "selftext": "# Intro:\n\n1. Intro\n2. Trends\n3. Who Gives a Shit\n4. I Want Money\n5. VSCO (Bullish)\n6. VSCO (Bearish)\n7. Entry, Positions, and TA\n\nThis post is going to be bullish on VSCO; Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. While we are all aware of the power of Becky during booms, we need to look at her counterpart Vicky during busts. Who is Vicky you ask? The swath of women caught up in slowing economic times looking to pair up and bed down with a mate during these economic winters. She's not going to college, she isn't reading a book in the park, she isn't trying on sensible cute outfits. She's showing off what God gave her and waiting for you to buy her a drink and cut to the chase by telling her what you can do for her. She isn't waiting for Mr. Right to bump into her outside of a Starbucks and have a meet-cute. She is toxic femininity leaving the bodies of men in her wake as she walks across them in all different types of stiletto's and goth boots that they probably paid for. She's making drag queens jealous with her over the top super-bitch magnetism. She is the physical embodiment of 80's hair metal electric guitar intro-riff, and she is here to rock your fucking world.\n\nFirst, this post may be starting off as a crude misogynistic take on \"modern ***dating\"*** and my username probably makes you think I'm some ultra douche-bag, but my intent is to bring to light the historical effects that economic hardship has on women and how we can profit on it, or at least weather the storm as the destroying dollar made equities only go up, and recession will make them go down. The counterpart version of this DD would be examining why penis pills, toupees, and giant pick-up trucks sell so well in recessions. Male spending gets fucking weird, unpredictable, and comical. Unfortunately, it's that unpredictable nature that makes it hard to trend and predict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ 2008 Ford Pick-up. It takes up the entire runway and makes the bushes look like grass! ](https://preview.redd.it/sqyrz649dck91.jpg?width=4288&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=911ff1f0d9551febc6be5cf0138c8adf63368998)\n\nTruth is, I am just being pragmatic investor with a non-biased situational awareness of modern society. Also, just because I call out women's instincts and nature and predictability, and treat them as equal, doesn't mean I hate them. Quite the opposite! I am in awe of the mysterious majestic complex savage beautiful animal they are (see gif related). All of my love ladies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Let's just say, I lost it in the divorce.](https://i.redd.it/cyrxs200fck91.gif)\n\n# Trends:\n\nThe world was shocked when Revlon seemed to rocket into space after their earnings report, and it got me looking at both tickers. (Rev DD to follow?) It seems that the time is finally here to bring out an \"ol' reliable\" that has repeatedly and predictably dropped in and out of society with every boom and bust cycle. A little known trend that we can ride into the atmosphere as a solid and time-tested hedge towards recession. On top of that, there are a few more booster rockets and factors strapped to the industry that can have some long-term growth potential continuing past this economic turmoil and shake-up.\n\nSo, let's kick it off with this:\n\n[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology - Boosting Beauty in an Economic Decline: Mating, Spending, and the Lipstick Effect](https://personal.tcu.edu/sehill/LipstickEffectMS20March2012.pdf)\n\nThis paper is from 2012, but it is not outdated. It discusses the historical effects on the spending habits of women during the recession, depression, world wars, and the reality of existing relationships and courting during these time periods. Here is an excerpt that sums up the thesis: \"An economic recession may signal that financially stable men are becoming scarce.\" Hitting close to home here chief?\n\nIt also states that Men's preferences in a mate lean more towards attractiveness (This is why my \ud83c\udf08 bros are so fit and hunky. They know what men like!) The demand for women to compete among each other for physical beauty intensifies as they struggle to find the rare elusive \"High-Quality Male\". That's the research paper's words, not mine. I would just say \"Dr. Job Not-Regarded\" or \"Mr. Clean Ninetafive\". It also states, unsurprisingly, that women spend a significant amount of time enhancing their appearance for their own ego boost. All in all, looking good and sexy leads to feeling good about yourself, and has little to do with men. Which may be why they have \ud83c\udf08 guys design all their clothes, and it's why she isn't responding to your DM.\n\nThe paper goes on to justify itself by looking at the 5% increase on cosmetics during the great depression, and the shift in priorities during spending, and other times of hardship. It is a messy bit of math and trying to put numbers to old data in order to validate the theory of \"The Lipstick Effect\". This is a term that Wikipedia defines as:\n\n*The* ***lipstick effect*** *is the theory that when facing an* [*economic crisis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis) *consumers will be more willing to buy less costly* [*luxury goods*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods)*.*[*\\[1\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect#cite_note-1) *Instead of buying expensive fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive* [*lipstick*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick)*.*[*\\[2\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect#cite_note-2) *The underlying assumption is that consumers will buy luxury goods even if there is a crisis. When consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, consumers will buy goods that have less impact on their available funds. Outside the cosmetics market, consumers could be tempted by expensive beer or smaller, less costly gadgets*[.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mansplaining&amp;ia=definition&amp;iax=about)\n\n# WHO GIVES A SHIT:\n\nWhat is indirectly proved is an increase in spending on cosmetics to look good. Without a doubt, in this modern era of selfies, Instagram, Bumble, Tinder, and Craiglist, there has almost NEVER been a more competitive market for women's dating. The Cell Phone has created an all you can eat pussy buffet and COVID has slingshot the amount of women looking to hurry-up and pair-up and wife-up into the marketplace after losing 3 years of courtship, dinner, laughing, travelling, and baby-making. Even women IRL are competing with their boyfriends over online THOTs getting paid to wear heavy makeup, play video games or workout with a camera on, or just have big boobs and a skinny waist while they lip sync a joke written by an ugly funny clinically depressed man. Fuck, even some anime cartoons are winning the war on continuing the human race. Despite the 50/50 split between the population of sexes on planet earth, women will need to compete harder as men exit the marketplace. If it just so happens that you are a woman reading this and thinking \"I don't relate to this. I don't have any problem meeting guys!\"; That's great babe, but this is mostly about the women keeping in-demand males through an increase of upkeep. Um... give me a call?\n\nMen, Bumble charging you more for swipes and shit is just a psyops convincing you of artificial scarcity. They know that if you can't initiate a conversation with a women in the wild, you'll be easy to take advantage of and pay up. As a confident adaptable man, my very mild rant ends here and this is where it should end. I think everyone already gets it, and there is nothing wrong with a healthy open conversation about the reality of ***how it be***. Nobody wants Incel bullshit comments, and that goes for you ladies as well.\n\n# I WANT MONEY:\n\nThis brings us to three important things going forward that will need to be acknowledged:\n\n1. Accept that we are in a recession even though unemployment (statistics) are down. If you think the economy is booming and better than it has ever been, you must be morbidly obese and never go outside. People are having a hard time and as inflation comes down, real unemployment goes up as a fundamental, and there is no true statistic that you will ever get from the labor department about how bad it truly is, because they have been changing definitions of unemployment pushing goal posts for so long it is a worthless metric. It is similar to how they changed the definition of recession, but do that every year since George W. Bush.\n2. **You**th virginity is up, marriages are down; and it isn't just about getting rocks off. Single mothers ( [Click for depression](https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/)) , women deep in debt and suffering food insecurity, and other factors sadly lead to pairing up as a matter of survival. Being married is incentivized by the government (one example) because our system is designed to have 2-person partnerships and it greatly reduces the number of people from being dependent on the system. The system and life in general is designed so partnered people have an easier time. The chaotic dance of scrambling for high quality partners in our petri dish intensifies magnitudes when fear of uncertainty begins looming.\n3. The current technology we have created has surpassed mankind's maturity. We are a bunch of monkey's with apps on our phone that let us fuck each other silly and tickle our reptilian brain. Doesn't matter how smart you are, you haven't overcome billions of years of evolution *\\*Elon\\_Musk.JPEG\\**. The natural order of breeding has been replaced with the sex marketplace of Tinder just like the natural order of hunting for food has been replaced by the supermarket. The sooner you get over it, the better.\n\nIf any of these 3 points are in juxtaposition with your world views, this isn't the DD for you. I like to live in fantasy land too, but I only make fantasy money in there so... here I am.\n\n# VSCO (Bullish)\n\nVSCO came out of IPO like an ugly girl in a romantic comedy that takes off her glasses. It stamped an all time high of $**74.77** ON August 13th, and continued to decline and decline to $**26.14** on June 13th, of 2022. A month before in April, the company reported a **loss of 4.5%** for the year. Since then it has made a rough and valiant effort to come back into a sub-median range of about $49.47.\n\n$74.77 -&gt; $26.14 -&gt; $49.47\n\nWhat is happening? Why the turn around? Well...\n\n&gt;*\"Victoria\u2019s Secret* ***&amp; Co***\\*. *has announced a new* ***streamlined corporate leadership structure*** *that will unite the company\u2019s three lines of business, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Pink and Beauty, into a single organization.\\*Amy Hauk, who has been CEO of Pink since 2018, will take on the additional role of CEO for Victoria\u2019s Secret, and the brands\u2019 merchandising, planning, marketing and creative teams will be integrated, the company said.Martin Waters will remain CEO of the parent company.\" \\[1\\]*\n\nPart of this re-structuring includes letting heads roll and cutting staff, **as you do** in lowering inflation and on-coming recession:\n\n&gt;*about 160 management roles, or about 5% of home office headcount, the company said. It will also provide for reinvestment in non-leadership roles, according to the company.Victoria\u2019s Secret &amp; Co. said it expects these decisions to \u201cresult in an estimated* ***$40 million cost reduction*** *in the run rate of the business on an annualized basis beginning in third quarter of fiscal 2022.\u201d \\[1\\]*\n\nSo far it seems like the new CEO has really hit the ground running. She is leading Victoria's Secret \"Brand Revolution\", and she seems very fit in this position. She was in a leadership role at Bath &amp; Body Works in 2008, and worked up to vice president in 2012. Also at GAP, and Disney. Part of her biggest ~~challenge~~ opportunity is combining Victoria's Secret with PinkTM and BeautyTM to create a three-headed [Ghidorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Ghidorah) of fast paced fashion savvy first to market monster. If you are clever you'd notice that I've bolded \"**&amp; Co\"** every time. Bullish.\n\nSome of the things she is doing include: opening up new stores, finding new test locations, re-modelling the traditional look for a more expansive and relateable product selection, closing down losing stores, expanding to include \"mannequins of different body types\" (Finally), becoming a more modern and eclectic yet agile retailer of women's beauty products and lingerie. She is breathing life into the company with \"stores of the future\" concept which seems to be an experimental concept shopping experience that your date/girlfriend/wife will definitely want to go to.\n\n&gt;*Victoria\u2019s Secret* ***&amp; Co*** *had 867 stores in North America at the end of the first quarter. That is down from 1,143 in 2018, but 94% of stores are cash flow positive. \\[2\\]*\n\nAnother pick of the litter hired is Christine Rupp\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here she is at what I assume to be a work function.  She is in the back.](https://preview.redd.it/pazgq40edck91.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83d22377731e44e30703c029afbd31d02bd4f85e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChristine (Chris to her friends) Rupp, who had previously worked at Amazon and helped launch Prime Day is the chief customer officer. 30 years experience, digital transformation specialist... Why is it a great pick? Because she is an expert in the tech-tonic shift in retail/online hybrid marketplaces, and has the professional connections from previous marketing jobs.\n\nDrum roll.... \ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\n\n&gt;***Victoria's Secret*** [***announced in May***](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/05/amazon-victorias-secret-pink-beauty-products.html) ***that it would for the first time sell some of its products, select items from Victoria\u2019s Secret Beauty and Pink Beauty, on Amazon.***\n\nSounds like Victoria's Secret is positioning itself as a try-before-buy retail store piggybacking on Amazons distribution ability! Using the online sales as teasers to get you into the store to see the more exotic selection. How forward thinking!\n\nThis sort of agility, distribution, market cornering, overhead-trimming, and safe experimental expansion is exactly what this company needs to take on the world of tomorrow. You may think this Amazon partnership is big, and it is, but you really need to see and understand the even bigger picture. The future of the trillion dollar industry that is \"make women pretty\" will NEVER stop selling their products. In fact, it will only ramp up as more women take back their feminine powers of seduction and use it to their advantage. They can make more money off a tweet than you do all month, maybe all year. You want a slice of that? You want a cut every time they powder their nose and turn the webcam on? You want to pimp these pimpettes? VSCO is your ticket. Going into the colder months, us as animals will begin our evolutionary imperative to bed down for the winter, so expect this next next quarter to reflect the lipstick effect. This quarters earnings we will see how hot-girl summer did. I'm optimistic, but cautious. However, the sexual marketplace is now changed forever. The competition and \"price of entry\" is now so high and low respectively, and will CONTINUE for the foreseen future.\n\n[Victoria\u2019s Secret unveils new corporate leadership structure](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/victoria-s-secret-co-unveils-new-corporate-leadership-structure-271657659120?siteid=yhoof2) \\[1\\] (Is there a more Bullish Headline?)\n\n[Victoria's Secret testing new locations, new look for stores](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2021/07/20/victorias-secret-testing-new-locations-new-look.html) \\[2\\]\n\n[Amazon to sell Victoria's Secret and Pink products](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/05/amazon-victorias-secret-pink-beauty-products.html) \\[3\\]\n\n*Pumping this stock with articles is ironic because of the amount of times their articles have pumped 15 year old me.*\n\n# VSCO (Bearish)\n\nNow, no DD is complete without including some downsides. Only scammers won't admit the downsides to a stock they are eyeing. VSCO is currently handling a bit of a crisis with a debt to equity ration of 15.20. Now, for a growth company a high ratio is to be expected, but indeed it sucks. Compared to Revlon's -2.07 ratio.\n\n[Debt/Equity Ration (High means bad)](https://preview.redd.it/comlzj1k5ti91.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99fd8d2ce90ba2a6277f30851852f2a5fa79737)\n\nDepending on who you ask, high debt is good in time of inflation, low interest rates, and growth. However, VSCO will be increasing their sales and revenue according to the above thesis, and the CEO is aware that in order to continue success, it needs to change quickly and knows that REV's earning are a early sign that things are looking up. Currently, [their interest rate on their debt is 1.85% Which is smack dab average among competitors.](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/EffectiveInterestRate/NYSE:VSCO/Effective%252BInterest%252BRate%252Bon%252BDebt/) You can see that it has had two quarters of steady decline. (What Reebok doin?)\n\nSo yes, the stock is climbing from it's lows. The numbers and financials seem to be typical of any IPO stock that is re-investing in itself and picking the right people to lead the charge to take advantage of the new scene. You can say \"Slut, that's pretty shitty dawg. I'm going to wait until they pay off their debt.\" Well, it's long-term debt that is rising slower than the rate raises, which means that part of it must be locked at a set amount. Also, if you want to know the secret to making money, you buy low and sell high.\n\nIf you want to wait, it'll be too late. I get it though. You deserve that stock that has perfect numbers, high growth potential, AND is undervalued and secret and no one knows about. All the most successful investors I know choose to wait until a company completely turns around to invest and have no recession proof hedging assets **/S.** Like I say all the time to women, lower your standards just a few inches please. There are competitors that sell similar products as the **&amp; Co** portion of VSCO which will also benefits from the thesis. They sell Church-approved makeup and lotions and clothes, but me?... I want the most Slut-tastic one. I want that fucking sizzlin' hot fajita full-throttle adrenaline blood-rush product. The kind of thing that will hook a man and reel him in.\n\n# Entry, Positions, and TA:\n\nEdit: The following was written 2 weeks ago (been waiting to post ), and has aged like wine. Earnings saw a sharp drop and an even sharper rejection. Lovin' it.:\n\n&gt;Been flipping big positions since REV shot up in June. Currently as of this second, I only have 10 shares, at an equity of $398.50. I expect the market to be bearish for the Jackson Hole meeting, where they will decide to doing anything BUT digitally delete the money they flooded into every part of the market except my wallet.I plan to buy a good healthy percent of my portfolio after, and because this is a **recession hedge for now**, options are not being highly balls-to-the-wall advised simply because the stock is mildly volatile and has higher IV than I would like, reaching it's mid-level cooling, and my (awful) technical analysis is showing a smoothing wedge or possibly a 3 month cup and handle (see pic related). Either way, a little now, a lot later is my plan. [Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ibk72igueti91.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3159cbbe977290d4fd32246504f69becd630eb95) If it is a cup and handle, feel free to get yourself some call options out to early December and January. I'm expecting a heavy earnings run-up which is on August 24th followed by an IV crush, and I will evaluate strike at that time. More than likely it will crash into the cup's handle, and then climb from there. I have set dates based on events, but if anyone would like to take a shot at really analyzing this chart be my guest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Edit: Updated chart showing what I expected.  Monday, we ride!](https://preview.redd.it/0mau4xchdck91.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf05b61b75809955e04a33e5d8249e62b93cd50)\n\nVSCO has a P/E of 6.621 as of writing, and I am shooting for a P/E of \\~10 which would bring it to \\~51.28 in the near term as the pain starts. HOWEVER, with the growth and restructuring, I am expecting a heavy amount of speculation Jet-fuel to get poured into the rocket which could really lift the P/E to something outrageous, and the stock along with it, but that isn't what this DD is about.\n\nVSCO has a SI% of: 8.4% according to [Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/VSCO/short-interest/) (I don't know what equation is being used here. OG or new formula). This means that smart money doesn't think it is a flaming pile of shit going out of business. (This coming from a guy who is a GME whale and BBBY holder so, don't take the joke personal)\n\n~~Insert nasty joke about the~~  ~~double entendre~~  ~~\"TA, Positions, and Entry\"~~\n\n[More TA](https://giphy.com/gifs/mashable-xTk9ZD4SA08oW3VSBa)\n\n# tldr;\n\nVSCO is about to benefit from the reliable and predictable trend of scarcity in the market of suitor males, causing women to fight for scraps (you) using their appearance to give them an edge in a HIGHLY competitive sexual market due to dating apps, instagram/twitch, COVID, and recession.\n\nEdit: Again, more wine.\n\n&gt;My play is to let a market-wide correction happen to enter a hedging position and ride up the restructured business model and speculative growth of Victoria's Secret \\*\\*&amp; Co.\\*\\*Also waiting on the earning report to evaluate options after an IV crush.\n\n**Short term goal is $51.28**\n\nYou: \"Hey Slut\\_Spolier, how short is short-term?\"\n\nMe: \"well, it's a recession hedge so...

    "title": "Educational: Mining Companies Learn About Explorers",
    "selftext": " \n\nHello boys and girls welcome to today's lesson where Rad teaches you how to evaluate and invest in mining companies. Yes, that's right I said invest, like long-term holding stuff and what not. Now you're probably thinking \"Why the hell would anyone post something about investing here, this place is for stupid shit.\" Well, here's my answer, if you can handle holding GME for over a year you can damn well learn to invest in companies. So welcome to a lesson. Not interested? Fine, go grab some SPY puts or something. But if you want to learn how to actually invest in stocks and how to pick decent companies (Yes companies can actually be good and there's more to know than SI and free float, maddening) then read along. I'm focusing on mining companies because this is where my money goes, but a lot of these ideas can be used for other investments.\n\n**Let's Get Started.**\n\nIf you made it this far, great job, you either took your ADHD medicine or you got distracted by a butterfly, forgot what you were reading and just ended up looking here and decided to continue on. As the title says, I'm going to be discussing mining companies. But before I do that, I need to define what a mining company actually is. Plain and simple, they're a company that takes something out of the ground and sells it. Usually they take rocks, often shiny ones and sell them for money. Think gold, silver, copper, tin, aluminum, uranium, I could make a giant list, but you get the idea. The big popular one you'll all think of is oil. Because I'm sure you've all seen oil price went up and you're looking to just throw cash at any oil stock hoping it'll magically go up because reasons. So that's what the focus is, something is in the ground that sells for money, a company is going to dig it up and sell it for money so they can dig more up and so on.\n\n**Types of Mining Companies: Explorers**\n\nThere are three types of mining companies, explorers, developers and producers. For this discussion I will be focusing on explorers. I'll probably write one up for developers and producers later on, depends on if more than 5 people even read this to begin with. So, the big question, what is an explorer? This is a company that currently has none of the thing they plan to sell. What they do have is a giant patch of land where they hope to find some of that stuff. They're \"exploring\" the land looking for stuff to sell, hence the name. These are the penny stocks of the mining community. You will find a ton of pure garbage here, and I mean hot garbage. How bad? Maybe 10% of all explorers will even manage to find something worth writing about. No not 10% will make money. 10% will find a patch of whatever good enough to even debate TRYING to make money off it. Worse off, a lot of these companies are complete scams. I'm talking 5 guys got together and made Greg's gold mining corp., put themselves as board members, went out to raise capital to buy a plot of land, and plan to sit on that plot, spending tiny amounts while raising money and paying themselves giant salaries for 5-10 years before they go \"Well looks like we didn't find anything. Guess we have to shut down and keep those salaries we paid ourselves, sorry.\" And this happens a lot. So be careful playing here. If you think Biotech can have scams you've seen nothing yet getting into mining explorers.\n\n**Explorers: So, If They're Trash Why Talk About Them?**\n\nSo, explorers often can be pure hot trash, but here's the thing. If you know how to evaluate them and find the good ones (What I hope to teach the 3 of you left still reading) you can see crazy returns. I'm talking companies going from $0.01 to $10.00 type of returns. See, these companies have so much trash that even potentially good ones often stay cheap, but on the other hand, if they prove they're legit that price can jump. Yeah, Greg's gold company might be a scam, but Greg's gold company also might find a giant gold deposit of super high-quality gold that's easy to mine. And here's the thing, even if Greg and pals are complete morons who have 0 clue how to build a mine, once they find that high quality deposit big companies will step in looking to buy that land for a whole lot more than Greg and pals paid for it. Yeah, Greg can't make a mine, but Barrick Gold sure as heck can, and if the deposit is top quality, they'll be willing to pay top dollar for it too. Here's a breakdown of more or less what a good scenario looks like. Greg and friend make a company and raise money. They get a patch of land and start exploring for gold. Greg and pals find a patch of gold. They now focus their exploring on that patch to see how good it is, probably raise some more money since they're going to want to see how deep and wide that patch goes. They see it's deep and wide and the gold grades are high. Barrick Gold sees Greg has a good gold patch. They come in and offer a Joint Venture (JV) with Greg. Barrick will pay for Greg and friends to continue exploring the patch and proving it out (Showing the resource is big enough, the grades high enough, the land can handle a mine and so on) in exchange for a percentage of the company. Greg and pals continue proving out that land, apply for a mining permit with the local government. Permit is granted, they prove out the patch, show there's enough infrastructure to be worth mining. Barrick now comes in and offers to buy out Greg's gold corp. You, the investor now gets paid. Either a flat payout at an agreed share price or your shares in Greg's gold corp. convert to an amount of Barrick Gold shares which you can then keep or sell. That's more or less the cycle for an explorer simplified. Now, there are some explorers who don't get bought and turn their patch of land into a mine, but it's rare. First, most explorers don't have that type of cash. Second, their team is usually made up of people who know how to find and evaluate a resource not people who know how to build and operate a mine. They'd have to hire those people which is expensive. So, if you're playing explorers, you\u2019re looking for them to find a good patch, prove it out then be bought out by a bigger company.\n\n**So How Do You Evaluate an Explorer?**\n\nOk, after probably way too many words we are at the part you probably care about, how to tell the good from the trash. Well, here's the number 1 thing for an explorer. MANAGEMENT OVER ALL OTHER THINGS. These companies have no resource, they have no mine, they probably don't have much of an office honestly. What they do have is a patch of unproven dirt and a team. The value is that team. You need to know who the CEO is and what's his/her's background. Have they run an explorer before? If so, how did that explorer do? How far did they get? Did they find anything, if so, was it worth anything? Have any of their previous projects been bought out and turned into a successful mine? Past success often shows future success. But there's more. Not only do you want to know if they've had success but where and in what. A guy who discovered the world's greatest silver mine in Argentina might not know a thing about finding a copper mine in Canada. Someone who helped discover and permit a gold mine in Nigeria might have no clue how to get a similar patch permitted in Australia. They need to have shown they know the resource and the area because that matter. One of my favorite stories is about a company exploring for uranium in Africa. They were having trouble finding anything. Then one day the CEO was sitting down eating lunch and he noticed an ant mound. The ants were carrying these little rocks that caught his eye. Turns out they were uranium. He had his team dig the mound and sure enough they found a high-quality uranium patch. Now what's interesting about this story isn't that he found uranium luckily through ants. What's interesting is using ant mounds to survey an area is a common tactic in Africa, but he didn't know that because he never ran a project in Africa. Someone who had would have saved a bunch of money because they would have looked to that ant mound first instead of digging expensive holes in different areas. Knowing local methods is important. Looking for gold in northern Canada? A lot of that surface gold came there through glacial drift. So, you need to know the tectonic patterns of the area, find some surface gold and then trace it for maybe 100+ kilometers to the source where it drifted from to find the original large patch. And yes, that's a legit gold exploring strategy used in Northern Canada. If the CEO or head Geologist doesn't know that don't waste your time on their project in Canada. They'll find surface gold but not realize they need to track it and instead waste time diffing up ground that won't have gold in it.\n\n**Evaluating an Explorer Continued.**\n\nA great and easy way to evaluate an explorer is by listening to the CEO talk. You should, with limited effort, be able to find YouTube videos of the CEO giving an interview and ideally to a channel that knows what to ask. Some of the channels I like to use are Crux Investors, Resource Talks, Bloor Street Capital, Mining Stock Education, and Kitco News. They all have interviews with a bunch of CEOs across multiple resource spaces along with interviews with sector people who will teach you more about a specific sector you're interested in. But regardless, a good CEO should have up at least a couple 15\u201320-minute YouTube interviews talking about the company. If they don\u2019t, I'd be worried about them promoting the company. Because YouTube interviews are super cheap for them and gets their company out to a bunch of people. If they're not talking, it's likely because they don't have anything good to say. Now when you watch that interview here's what I look for. I want a CEO who is knowledgeable. They should be teaching me things I didn't know about the sector, about exploring, their plan, whatever. The more knowledgeable the better. They should be able to talk not just about their specific company but their sector as a whole too. Next, I want an honest CEO. Any explorer, regardless of stage has huge risks. They better be mentioning risks. Now I don't need them to trash the company. But as an example, let's say they've found a patch of something and they're working on a permit. Permits are hard as heck to get. They better not be saying how the permit is coming and they have 0 worry. If they're in Canada I better hear them talking about how they're working with the First Nation people to get the project going They don't mention that at all, I'm thinking they expect the local First Nation people to oppose them and don't want anyone to find out, and that's an easy way to have a mine denied in Canada. Also, you might notice this is the 3rd or 4th time I've talked about something specific to Canada. That's because it's good for you to also be aware of the obstacles of a given area the company is in. Permitting is hard in the US and Canada, but much easier in Africa. On the other hand, Canada and the US don't have concerns of a local revolution shutting a mine down like many places in Africa do. Different areas come with unique risks to the project. Ideally, try to stick to one major area and know what common roadblocks and geological things come up. Mining Stock Education has a bunch of videos that'll teach you about this if you're interested. Back on topic. Last thing, I need to trust the CEO. If ANYTHING AT ALL gives me even the slightest red flag, I don't invest. I have looked away from companies because the CEO was too positive to the point of sounding like a used car salesman and that was my deal breaker. Maybe that company works out, IDK and I'm not risking money to find out. Also check their website. It better be legit and list out the projects they have and give a good description of what they're doing. Many of these companies have websites that look fine at first, but then you click around and realize the project page lists the name of a single property with 0 info. RED FLAG!\n\n**Ok I picked a company and invested, now I HODL right?**\n\nNO NO NO NO. Now you pay attention to their news releases. Follow their Twitter and see what they're putting out. If they're exploring and doing well, they should be talking about new holes they're digging, patches they've found, something. They should always have a clear next step they're working on and once that step is done some type of results to put out. You don't need to be a geological expert and fully interpret their findings. But at least have an idea of what a good finding is. They looking for gold in Canada? What's a good percentage of gold to be found in a result? Is it pure gold or a gold silver copper mix (gold especially tends to have copper mixed in and copper tends to have gold mixed in. To the point sometimes a copper project ends up becoming a gold and copper project because there's a lot of gold there too.) If they did put out good numbers what was the size and depth of the drill hole? How much cash do they have and how much to they need to raise? This one is key because it'll let you know how much dilution to expect (dilution is common to fund these projects and it's not a bad thing as long as they're using the money wisely. In other words, spending it on drilling and analyzing not on the CEO bonuses which some companies do). Check their website and see if there's some news release you might have missed. You don't have to do this every day, but you should have an idea of when to look from the news. They planning to drill a new hole in the fall? Ok come fall be ready to check the website and twitter to see if there's an update. Also, and this is key, if you find a winner take some profits. Even good projects can fall apart for reasons One of my favorite copper explorers, who found a good patch, had a JV with a big company and was well on their way to paying out big took a 66% hit because their Alaska project lost their road permits they got under the Trump administration when the new Biden lead agency decided to remove the permits because of complaints of locals they felt were previously ignored. Now they might get that permit back and go up again, but it's a roadblock that came out of nowhere. And this happens in the US and Canada. Companies say they're all set then the local First Nation people in Canada decide they don't like the mine, or they want a better deal and boom, permit is denied. These things can become nice winners fast. Going from nothing to finding something can be a nice 3-10X alone. And if they hit dear lord take some money out or you will go crazy as again this field has a high failure rate for all sorts of reasons.\n\n**So Which Company Should I Pick?**\n\nNope, sorry. I gave you channels to check out. I gave you methods to evaluate. Now you have to put this to work and decide for yourself. My suggestion, first pick a resource you're bullish on for whatever reason, then check out some videos talking about that resource and see if you agree. If you do, then start looking into companies. But I'm not naming any, mostly because there's not a single explorer even close to the required market cap. If you could read through this small novel, you can watch a couple YouTube videos.\n\n**Final Disclaimer**\n\nRemember, I am some random dude on the internet. I've shared with you what I do when evaluating exploration companies, but this is my method, and it might not be the best method. By all means if you feel I left something out, go ahead and add that into your method of research.\n\n**TLDR:** Sorry if you need a TLDR this wasn't for you. I can't condense this into a couple sentences.",

    "title": "The reason why I think BBBY will go much higher than everyone thinks.",
    "selftext": "Hey guys I\u2019m a highly regarded ape and everything I\u2019m about to say could be totally wrong. \n\nFirst off, let\u2019s look at what GME did last year. It jumped from under $10 a share to over $400 a share during the squeeze. At the time the economy was doing much better than it is now. Hedge fund companies were trying to short the company to bankruptcy and the apes came in and essentially stopped that from happening. From what I remember, GME didn\u2019t acquire any loan nor was there speculation of a merge or partial sale of the company. Yet the short squeeze still happened. \n\nFast forward to today and look at BBBY. The company looked like it was free falling into bankruptcy so everyone began squeezing the shorts and drove the price up to over $30 from less than $5. No one expected RC to sell and when he did, all the paper handed bitches started panic selling. Everyone reacted and didn\u2019t actually think about the fact that if RC sold and BBBY went bankrupt that his nuts would be on the line for insider trading. It didn\u2019t make any sense and everyone was confused. I knew something else had to be going on. I bought the dip around 9.32 and the next day BBBY announces that they are getting a $400 million loan. This made bankruptcy out of the question. \n\nFast forward to yesterday where JPow slammed his dick on the table and essentially said \u201cthere\u2019s going to be pain.\u201d The entire market loses over $3 Trillion after a 10 minute speech. But what does BBBY do? It snorts a fat green crayon and closes over 6%. \n\nNow time to speculate the future. BBBY has said that it plans an announcement for the 31st (next Wednesday) to explain to investors what it plans to do to save the company. If they plan to merge with RC or sell BABY, then BBBY is going to take lift off. There is a lot of confusion on whether the short interest float is 40% or 108%. If it\u2019s 108% the bears are going to be in a world of hurt. Let\u2019s say it is, the stock starts blowing up and reaches over $30. Investors across the globe are going to be looking anywhere they can to make their money back from yesterday and a lot will likely start getting FOMO and start pumping into the stock. The shorts are scheduled to close next Friday 9/2 and everyone is going to be looking to stick it to the bears. \n\nThe stock has potential to actually hit an infinite squeeze like the VW squeeze in 08\u2019. The hedge funds and Robinhood are all going to try and prevent this from happening. The media will tell everyone not to buy, RH will halt trades, and hedge funds will pump and dump shares to try and trigger everyone to sell. If everyone diamond hands their shares until Friday, there won\u2019t be anything they can do about it. If this happens the way I think it might, we could be looking at a total market collapse in the month of September. All I can say for now is if you buy don\u2019t sell. Buy the dips and hold on for one of the greatest moments in market history. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I just like the stock. Do not put more money in than you are willing to lose. This is a casino. There will be bag holders before this is over. Invest at your own risk. God speed. \u270c\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "On WSB, there are two ways to trade:  be regarded or be artistic. People have been posting truly regarded plays at terrible entry points, which is entertaining.

I\u2019ll seek to answer both of these questions and discuss my positions on how I plan on maximizing gains for both of these situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When Will the Squeeze Happen?**\n\nScenario 1:  August 31st Announcement and Reg SHO Threshold list prompts instant squeeze by September 2nd. I think there will positive price action but I\u2019m not sure there is enough volume of options expiring that Friday for a MOASS. I also think hedge funds will do some shenanigans to weasel out of closing their shorts at this time.\n\nScenario 2:  September 16th options has extremely high volume. We could see a gamma squeeze in the first couple of weeks of September and forced closing of shorts leading up to monthly options expiration. I think this is slightly more likely than Scenario 1.\n\nScenario 3:  Jan 2023 has a truly massive amount 60c and 80c expiring. If there was a time for a gamma squeeze, it might be here. If these expire ITM it will be a transfer of wealth in the billions of dollars from hedge funds to retail the likes we haven\u2019t seen since GME. I think this is less likely than Scenario 2, but RC did buy a lot of options with these dates and strikes, so who knows?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is \u201cFair Market Value\u201d for BBBY?**\n\nWhile a squeeze could see prices in the hundreds, it will eventually drop back down, albeit to a stable price higher than today. Friday close of $10.70 makes BBBY\u2019s current market cap $855mm. Valuing companies with negative EPS is very difficult. BBBY is not a tech company, so they\u2019ll need to start actually making money in 2023 to start paying off their debts.\n\nWhat does BBBY have going for it? Most valuations of Buy Buy Baby are around \\~$1B give or take. Selling/spinning off this asset fixes debt problems, but it already secured a loan so bankruptcy isn\u2019t an immediate threat.\n\nTheir financials aren\u2019t as bad as people think, but it\u2019s very clear that they were being run into the ground by poor leadership. Sales per Share is fantastic and if you compared it to a retailer like Target ignoring everything else, BBBY could be valued at \\~$55/share with a \\~$4B market cap *(of course it\u2019s not that simple)*. Their Gross Profit Margin is in the mid-30s, which is nearly unheard of for retail. Comparable retailers usually are in the mid-20s or even teens. Their Operating Profit Margin is LITERAL ASS though dropping steeply in 2019 and then going negative in 2020 due to Covid. (See blue circle.)\n\n[BBBY Financials on Think or Swim](https://preview.redd.it/bfl4wxfp46k91.png?width=3017&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5932f2a6b43e0f2affbf8f0c17bb1eda009c47e2)\n\nIf under new leadership BBBY could make adjustments to how the business is fundamentally ran and bring it in line with competitors, there is no reason why its market cap shouldn\u2019t be several billion. CEO was replaced and Ryan Cohen brought in several board members with key skill sets. We\u2019ll see during the August 31st announcement on how they plan on doing this.\n\nHowever, debt is an issue. A $3B issue. They secured a loan and bankruptcy is avoided in the short term, but they need to be made into a profitable company and start servicing their debt. Selling Buy Buy Baby would clear a large chunk of that debt but leave total potential sales lower. I think in either scenario, given their current financial situation and direction, I would assign a stable price target in 2023 of $30-35 (\\~$2.5b market cap), around where it was trading a year ago.\n\nAlternatively, a buyout could be announced next week. If so, valuation is key. I do not see BBBY being sold for less than $1B, but $2B might be a stretch. $20 a share is $1.6B, so I would think low $20s is possible. I think this scenario is the most unlikely when compared to spin off of Buy Buy Baby or a merger of some sort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How Do I Trade with the Above Assumptions?**\n\nBuy shares and hold. The majority of your money should go to shares when it\u2019s trading around $10. You can\u2019t fuck it up if you are early and are patient. But this isn\u2019t r/stocks, so let\u2019s give some real advice.\n\nLong dated calls with modest strikes ($10 to $20). Putting it all on Sept 2nd OTM options is regarded. We have no idea what will be said on August 31st and we don\u2019t know how much the market will react. You\u2019ll still make plenty of profit buying Sept 16th or Jan 2023 options. There is strong support around $10, so buying $10c is a safe play. I tend to prefer at the money (ATM) instead of way OTM, but I\u2019m not regarded.\n\nSpreads can help you in high volatility. BBBY\u2019s IV has spiked to 233.9%. Options are overpriced. If you buy a modest strike you can sell way OTM options and lower your total costs. These will perform well if you can accurately guess true market value at expiration, but will perform worse during a squeeze when volatility will spike further. I would be VERY careful around August 31st with your straight up calls because if there isn\u2019t a large price movement after the announcement, we\u2019ll see a drop in IV much like what happens after an earnings call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Trades**\n\nI first entered BBBY on Friday August 5th at $7.63. IV had already spiked, so I SOLD $10c for 2024 and with some of the premium then bought $10c every week for the next 6 weeks. Even if a squeeze didn\u2019t happen and all my options expired worthless, if by 2024 BBBY was trading above $10 I would still have a \\~50% return. Two weeks later after spiking to $25, I sold all my $10c as they were all +1000% to 2000% because I am not a bag holder. I did use a little money to buy $20/30c weekly spreads that expired worthless because I am a little regarded.\n\nOn the way down I bought some shares and even more when it dipped below $10, bringing my cost basis to $11.50. I also bought back my covered calls for break even. When the announcement of the loan occurred, I had to start planning on how to spend my previous gains. This is what I came up with:\n\n\u2022\t**BBBY $10c 9/16:**  If a squeeze occurs in the next month, this is where I will make most of my money. Unless if August 31st is an absolute dud, $10c should be ITM. I have a sell order for 1/4 of them when they go +300% to cover my initial costs so I am not caught bag holding if it drops again.\n\n\u2022\t**BBBY $20c/$60c Jan 2023 spreads:**  IV is very high, so spreads lower the prices considerably. I believe on expiration that these spreads will be the most profitable at a variety of price levels below $90/share, of which I have graphed below. A 2151% max return is \u201cenough\u201d for me and if an acquisition occurs with a value in the $20s, they will still pay well. It performs better than $10/$60c at share prices above $30, which is very possible by Jan 2023. Finally, the high volume of $60c will give me high liquidity if I need to exit early.\n\n\u2022\t**BBBY $10c/20c Jan 2024 spreads:**  They are stupidly cheap right now and could yield a \\~500% max gain. This is the best play if either a buyout is announced on Thursday or you are very patient. With the new loan they acquired, I don\u2019t see a scenario where they go bankrupt or trade below $10 by 2024.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hold6yht46k91.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2268a0bf5e311c0029bb14ae84d97037c574de8\n\n***TLDR:***  *Don\u2019t be regarded. Buy mostly shares with some longer dated calls at modest strikes. Spreads can help you against high volatility and IV crush. 1000% to 2000% returns are good enough to take SOME profits.*",

However, here is some technical analysis for GME currently that I wanted to point out, and will at least increase your chance of winnings. Since June 1st to now, GME has had a support at about the $29-30 mark with it bottoming out since then, 5 times. The intervals of increase and decrease has been about 3 weeks. We are currently at a bottom(currently $30.60), and the rsi and stochastic indicator is currently at the undersold line. I think that if there\u2019s a time to buy it would be now and set a sell at $35 for a good chance of 16% profit.",

    "title": "Master meme-stocks analyst here! (#TrustMeBro or check my profile). This post is not about making a prediction, that's on you. Welcome to my TED talk mainly about BBBY's architecture and meme-stocks as a whole.",
    "selftext": "# Greetings regards and gamblers, bag-holding whales and Wendy's moon-hunters!\n\nI'm here to share with you my technical model for BBBY. (proof that I'm not full of poop at the bottom of the post)\n\nLet's state the obvious first :  \nThere are many actors involved manipulating the valuation, mostly institutions + hedge-funds.  \nNo WSB didn't cause the recent boom, with synthetic positions in custody-brokers, nor did R.Cohen five months after taking postion.  \nIt's no secret that this sub is being monitored daily by Wall Street, and it's not such a big leap to speculate that the hype-train here was ignited by some carefully shilled posts. If you've ever seen stealing-comments bots on Reddit/Youtube, or thot-bots on Instagram, you know there's a couple of them roaming around among the 12.5 million degenerates.\n\nIf you believe trend-analysis to be akin to Astrology you're probably :  \n\\-Expecting it to be a crystal ball to give you the loto-numbers  \n\\-Disapointed from past experiences because of some overhyped weather-man  \n\\-Lack education on this (extremely difficult to master) subject.\n\nAbout me : I'm the most upvoted account on eToro, exclusively around GME daily charts (total likes, not followers, and yes I know they suck as a broker, I'm already out and DRSed).My full-time obsession for the last 5 years has been to reverse-engineer big player's trading-bots using geometry to translate their equations and patterns, I believe I am almost there, and before you start asking about my financial situation, let's simply say I have enough leisure-time to write this post. Also, I'm French, so please ignore any weird phrasing.\n\nOK, so here's our situation since the 2020's \\*cough cough\\* recovery. Crazy rips and dips can sometime overshoot and blur the borders but, except from all those shenanigans, funds are running a pretty tight ship :\n\n[Weekly candles for simplification, Daily coming next. Click to zoom-in.](https://preview.redd.it/3us9ujibsok91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d9e7293cc27b7042eec189480a3203bf94d283)\n\nSo if you've come here looking for answers to your bag-holding situation and have never opened a chart or used a ruler in your life, you're probably asking yourself \"what the F am I looking at ?!\".I don't blame you, if you're highly regarded, this probably looks like pure chaos and insanity. It's really just two channels one that I would call \"UP\"(dog) and the other \"DOWN\"(syndrom). The blue-horizontal is the most important historical level to conquer in our direct vicinity =&gt; today's rejection.Focus on one angle at a time by tilting your head like you're playing a racing-simulator.\n\nLet's quote Investopedia for some kindergarden-level explanation here :\n\n\\-\\*\"\\****Understanding a Price Channel***\n\n*A price channel forms when a security's price is buffeted by the forces of supply and demand, and can be upward, downward, or sideways* [*trending*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp)*. These forces affect the price of a security and can cause it to create a prolonged price channel. The dominance of one force determines the price channel\u2019s trending direction. Price channels can occur over various time frames.*\n\n*The lower* [*trendline*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp) *is drawn when the price pivots higher, while the upper trendline is drawn when the price pivots lower. The steepness of inclines and declines determine the direction of the price channel's trend. An upward, or* [*ascending price channel*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingchannel.asp) *will be bounded by trendlines with a positive slope indicating that the price is trending higher with each price change.*\n\n*Price channels are quite useful in identifying breakouts, which is when a security's price breaches either the upper or lower channel trendline. Additionally, traders can also trade within the channel\u2014sell when price approaches the channel's upper trendline and buy when it tests the channel's lower trendline.\"*\n\nSounds easy enough ? Price goes boing-boing on invisible floors and ceilings created by ...ahem... \"forces of supply and demand\" ^((manipulative rich bastards with enough fire&amp;supressing-power to decide where each stonk will be valued at any given date based on how much debt-liquidity the FED and BlackRock are comfortable to print))If price breaks above or below, and seemingly breaks the model you can be pretty sure another parallel following the same angle will spawn once a new support has been found. My theory is that those are bots performing the same equation in a loop, buy&amp;short channeling towards a specific price-target at a specific date. Did I hear FDs in the crowd ?\n\nThanks to a hint on \"disjointed channels\" from my good friend and colleague u/TiberiusWoodwind , I've started to experiment around with something I already did unconsciously in every model :-**EQUILATERALITY**It can simply be found everywhere you look (only proof-tested in *GME* and *BBBY* for now), I cannot explain it, tho I believe it may have something to do with the word \"**HEDGE**\". If there's a meaningfull uptrend you've found, chances are there's an equilateral downtrend that will or has already spawned somewhere against it. And reciprocally.The result is a visually tangible conflict of interest : **TRIANGLES** (they come in a variety of shapes, but here we're talking about equilaterals) At the very tip, under tons of pressure (Apex), the duel comes to a final decision and one side wins, often in a spectacular manner.\n\n**-**[**GOLDEN RATIO (FIBONACCI)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp)Here's the Investopedia link because I'm too lazy to explain such a long subject in an already-too-long post.\n\nLet's zoom-in:\n\n[Enhance = 1DAY candles ](https://preview.redd.it/89aiavbeuok91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afe780c3410108fd9152ab91db48606cae6d98a1)\n\nAgain, potential brain-freeze. Remember each candle here is one day, and if you check that shit every morning, there aren't that many lines/objectives to focus on based on curent volatility. Also, depending on the number of data-points (rebounds), you can pay attention to some more than others, like that one Green descending parallel we touched today, which played a major role as a support then resistance early in this year.\n\nDisplayed in Purple and Yellow are the two moving averages I use as a crossing/divergence indicator : VWAP and VWMA (personnal settings top-left corner).As a rule of thumbs : Purple crossing above Yellow = Bullish, and reciprocally.The game is to predict the trajectory before it happens, as with every lagging indicator.They also serve as awesome support/resistance.\n\nBut more importantly, here comes the reason for my username : I f$cking love exponential momentum // parabolics !\n\n[ENHANCE: It appears we broke temporarily above the negative trend that contained us since the pump. Again, today's rejection level has historical significance and we need to climb above the moving averages \\(purple and yellow\\) before the end of this week to confirm positive momentum. ](https://preview.redd.it/6qybsne02pk91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82f08c567b347eed4c36ab639c49cfc8cd91cc69)\n\n**In depth rambling :**Markets move based on a chaotic mix of human emotions and algorithmic intentions. In a 2D space, this translates geometrically as curved and straight lines following inertia/momentum, that are both mathematical and psychological. In highly controlled markets like what we deal with in memed-stocks, the robots have the upper-hand, and they only let humans fill gaps that respect their BEEP-BOOP narrative.Exponential curves, or parabolas, are a purely organic motion dynamic that works in all kind of possible situation in the Universe and you can find them in every chart with volatility. Example : at the very start of an IPO, or any pump&amp;dump in History. If you understand what a Head&amp;Shoulders pattern and its inverted version, then you know what I'm talking about : gain or loss of momentum.All good ? Now focus on the idea that the faster an \"impulsive\" move reaches vertical velocity --like this white parabolic explosion right here--, without confirming supports for solidity, step by step-- the more likely it is to reach an extreme breaking point. Example for dips : massive sell-pressure eats away the buyers order-book, wich leaves lower and lower asking prices and triggers a domino of stop-losses.\\*PTSD intensifies\\*\n\nThis can be imputed to what is known as a \"Keynesian beauty contest\", the single most important concept to understand in trading: people will buy or sell NOT based on their own beliefs or instincts, but how they expect the herd / collective consciousness to react. (^(multiplicating into a toroidal pattern of belief/faith, a multidimensional fractal, self-perpetuating mirrored vortex : a donut))In brief, it translates as curved erections on the chart.\n\nRemember the part about triangles ? Here's my chat from this morning :\n\n[Falling wedges \\(white VS orange-dots here\\) have a very high probability to be bullish. For the bigger triangle I took my bet based on the angle of yellow-dots VS red.](https://preview.redd.it/bx9nx244mpk91.jpg?width=2248&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5a6497214f1cfb62f0a73dd3542b7170c94fa2)",

    "title": "Why BBBY is popping and why it will keep popping (at least for a little bit)",
    "selftext": "TLDR: shorts thought this was a standard pump and dump that they've been doing to us ever since Gamestop, but some catalysts and turns of events have made this one different, and slightly more similar to GME &amp; AMC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs we know, $BBBY is up over 20% today, which is great both for bagholders and new highly regarded degenerates opening positions. This is happening for a couple reasons (which probably many of us are well aware of, but I wanted to make a post to ensure that all regards have the information).\n\nAfter the initial surge to \\~30$/share, $BBBY saw some large red dildos bringing it down below $10/share. Over the course of that time, so many new short positions were opened that the percentage of float shorted now exceeds 100%. Mostly large institutional investors, as well as some miscellaneous regards (minimal difference), were betting that we did not have the gumption to create a second squeeze, as happened with Gamestop. The reason they think they can do this is because they have been doing this to us nearly every week for the past year. Some shit stock gets pumped up and then crushed by shorts, because it doesn't catch quite enough wind for anything more than an initial surge - so shorts keep winning. They have been doing this to trick us into being bagholders (often times, 'they' actually engage in the initial pump to catch our attention - you can see this based on the order flow of huuuuuge orders coming in in the very beginning, followed by smaller regard flows. Then they crush us, taking our money and repeatedly creating new bagholders. Look at literally any meme stock and its order flow over the last year).\n\nAnyways, the shorts have been following their same playbook as with all the other less well-known meme stocks that came after GME &amp; AMC. Unfortunately for the shorts, this time is a bit different. $BBBY actually DID catch enough wind from the Apes to maintain focus longer than our typical attention span of 2 days. RC also betrayed us - a new catalyst that we don't typically see. Still, the shorts weren't worried because they knew $BBBY had liquidity issues and therefore could not survive much longer, so even if we had a second wind, they only had to wait so long until the company filed for bankruptcy. The shorts thought they had the win, because they thought that nobody was stupid enough to lend to $BBBY. BUT THEN, someone actually WAS stupid enough to lend them $400 million as a bridge loan, which will keep them afloat for much, much longer. Now, analysts question whether the company will file for bankruptcy at all. Shorts are starting to panic, because they know we've got them dead to rights if we see this. \n\nTheir thesis has been ruined by additional catalysts and liquidity that they did not plan for. With the new liquidity, they will have to keep their short positions open MUCH longer to MAYBE achieve the original bankruptcy thesis. They will slowly bleed due to high interest fees, and will now question whether to keep their short positions open at all, as it is probably no longer worth it. Apes like us, AND other large institutions are starting to see this and bidding the stock upwards to pressure the 100%+ of float short positions to close and give up. Now, with the strategy announcement coming on the 31st, both Apes and institutions know it's the time to strike - because $BBBY management will reveal their plan of how to use the $400M to stay alive. It's truly the perfect storm. That's why it popped today, and that's why it will keep going.\n\nPositions: 10 $20 Calls expiring in 2ish weeks",

Let's pay attention on it. \n\n  \n\n# Barclays Suspends Until Further Notice Further Sales and Issuances of Two Series of iPath\u00ae ETNs (the \u201cETNs\u201d)\n\nMarch 14, 2022 09:13 AM Eastern Daylight Time \n\nThis suspension is being imposed because Barclays does not currently have sufficient issuance capacity to support further sales from inventory and any further issuances of the ETNs. \n\nBarclays expects to reopen sales and issuances of the ETNs as soon as it can accommodate additional capacity for future issuances. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmhb3fa4jnk91.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136f89facecc58ac6b20361248c8a7dc9c0d5d4d",

    "title": "The Biggest Short: Why $AAPL Is An Overvalued Company in Decline",
    "selftext": "Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.\n\nWhile everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple\u2019s valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.\n\nA lot of people treat Apple like it\u2019s the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:\n\n&gt;P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  \n&gt;  \n&gt;D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long term debt: $93B  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM Earnings: $59.4B\n\nCurrently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:\n\n&gt;P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)\n\nIn their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.\n\nApple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.\n\nThe reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. \n\nApple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple\u2019s revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple\u2019s revenue and earnings will drop even more.\n\nEveryone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn\u2019t as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it\u2019s expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can\u2019t see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAnother product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they\u2019ve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they\u2019re gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [\u201cmocked\u201d](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.\n\nApple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it\u2019s hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That\u2019s a pretty big risk for a company that\u2019s been bleeding cash.\n\nAnd finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple\u2019s main advantages with their software is the fact that they don\u2019t show ads. When this changes, Apple\u2019s software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple\u2019s ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it\u2019s hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he\u2019s full of bad takes.\n\nAs Apple\u2019s earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. \n\nIf they don\u2019t halt or decrease their buyback, they\u2019ll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.\n\ntl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it. This thing is going to come down eventually, the only question is when.",

    "selftext": "I'm assuming you were too young at the time or maybe forgot since humans clearly forget shit all the time, especially when it goes against their thinking.\n\nDo you all not remember the famous **Volkswagen** (**VW**) squeeze of 2008? Shit went ballistic and **gained like 400%+ in 2 days**. VW became the world's #1 most valuable company for a short time during the squeeze. ***(Estimations shorts lost almost $40 billion.)***\n\n**-** **HerbalLife** **(HLF)** got squeezed when Ackman and Icahn duked it out....Icahn won and walked away +$1billion, ***Ackman covered for double his entry, so figure out that loss*** LMAO.\n\n**-** **Tesla** **(TSLA)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $40 Billion in 2020)*** \\- *I don't need to hear about how great TSLA is*. TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.\n\n**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better.\n\n**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the \"value\" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point.\n\nNow I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Strategic news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**\n\nShills, let's see you change my mind...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Stocks have been squeezed crazy high for ages. Let me repeat to you extra regarded apes in the back. SQUEEZED FOR FUCKING AGES with billllllions in losses.

I read it so you don\u2019t have to, but I do think it\u2019s worth taking a look.\n\n\u201cGriffin\u2019s interest in the market dates to 1986, when a negative Forbes magazine story on Home Shopping Network, the mass seller of inexpensive baubles, piqued his interest and inspired him to buy some put options.\u201d (Meet Kenneth Griffin p.2)\n\nHe, \u201cbought one or two put options contracts, and turned a quick $5,000 profit when the stock fell.\u201d (Meet Kenneth Griffin p.2)\n\nKenny\u2019s first play back in 1986 seems to foreshadow the career that will follow. Dude could have posted his gains with the rest of you. He wouldn\u2019t reach mod status until later.\n\n\u201cA shrewd investor \u2014 the Cabot House sophomore was short heading into the \u201987 crash \u2014 Griffin\u2019s stellar returns place his firm among a tiny elite.\u201d (Meet Kenneth Griffin p. 2)\n\nKenny G. was going short from the very beginning.\n\n\u201cHe built an internal stock lending operation in the late 1990s to allow Citadel to fly below Wall Street\u2019s radar screen on sensitive short sales; it\u2019s the kind of operation run only by major investment banks.\u201d (Meet Kenneth Griffin p. 4)\n\nAlready finding ways to hide his short sales in the 1990s. Were going to come back to this next part later:\n\n\u201cIn September 1990 Griffin began trading a convertible arb strategy as a separate account for Glenwood. One year later, duly impressed with Griffin\u2019s maturity \u2014 and his 70 percent returns \u2014 Meyer introduced him to Glenwood\u2019s clients, enabling him to raise a then-significant $18 million fund called Wellington Partners. Griffin leased 3,000 square feet of space in an office building in Chicago\u2019s historic Loop district and launched the five-person fund. (Meet Kenneth Griffin p. 6)\n\n\u201cconvertible arb\u201d \u2013 remember that for later\n\nBasically, though Kenny G is killing it from the get go and he has a strong background in shorting. There\u2019s a lot more in the article, it\u2019s honestly worth a read.\n\nSo, Kenny knows how to make a killing in crashes. How did he do in 2008?\n\nBut first Failure to Deliver. FTDs.\n\n**PART 2 \u2013 FTDs**\n\n**A Super Short History:**\n\nFailure to Deliver or FTDs have been around a long time...\n\n\u201cTulip mania reached its peak during the winter of 1636-37, when contracts were changing hands five times. No deliveries were ever made to fulfill any of these contracts\u201d (amsterdamtulipmuseumonline.com)\n\n\u201cAt the turn of the century, the stock speculator Daniel Drew battled with Cornelius Vanderbilt over control of the Harlem and Erie Railroads by issuing unregistered securities and selling short stock that he had not borrowed.\u201d (Welborn p. 3)\n\nDaniel Drew is the one know for quipping the line famous around here, \u201cHe who sells what isn\u2019t his\u2019n, must buy it back or go to pris\u2019n\u201d (Welborn p. 3)\n\n**FTDs in the early 2000s:**\n\nThe Dot-Com Bust:\n\nThe Continuous Net Settlement system\u2019s \u201cinability to moderate FTDs became clear during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.\u201d (Welborn p. 8)\n\nThe 2000s Crash even led to:\n\nThe final short sale rule, Regulation SHO, was passed in August 2004 and became effective in January 2005.\u201d (Welborn p. 8)\n\nREGULATION SHOW! - BYE BYE FTDs! Not really though...\n\nExceptions \u201cundermined Regulation SHO\u2019s ability to reduce FTDs.\u201d (Welborn p. 9)\n\nThe Grandfather Clause \u201cexempted all pre-existing FTD positions, and a market making exception allowed options market makers to delay settlement for the purpose of bona fide market making. Regulation SHO was largely ineffective as a result, and FTDs actually increased from 2005 through 2008 (OEA, 2008 and 2009).\u201d (Welborn p. 9)\n\nMan, the SEC is really on it.\n\n**HOW TO FTD FROM 2005 to 2008**\n\nI found a Dissertation that showed that the GME FTD 'naked short' Thesis was correct back in 2013, and that is all thanks to some prodigy named John W. Welborn.\n\nSo, back to 2005. Reg Sho was recently enacted and Market Makers were handed an FTD exemption \u2013 they start hiding their FTDs away in options and FTDs increased from 2005 to 2008.\n\nIn 2007, the SEC admits that,\n\n\u201cThe ability of options market makers to sell short and never have to close out a resulting fail to deliver position... may have a negative impact on the market for those securities\u201d (SEC, 2007b, p. 21). (Welborn p. 25)\n\nWow! You don\u2019t say...\n\nIn \u201c2007 the Commission eliminated the \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision and in 2008 the Commission eliminated the \u201coptions market maker\u201d exception.\u201d (Key Points About Regulation SHO \u2013 [sec.gov](https://sec.gov/))\n\nWhat's with the stagger? Trying to make sure your friends on Wall Street have time to settle their FTDs? How'd that work out for you?\n\nMarket Makers lose their options loophole which leads us to our first chart from John Welborn\u2019s Three Essays on Naked Short Selling and Fails-To-Deliver:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mymn4bckyvk91.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba21e5459c3f78eb5fe9b02ea478d36882374759\n\nIn 2008 the Market Maker Options loophole for hiding FTDs is stripped away and the use of options falls off of a fucking cliff. It even looks like they possibly try to settle their FTDs after the change is announced on the 7th of July, but end up in a cycle before that September/October triple-witching windows rears it's ugly head.\n\nWelborn finds that, \u201c**settlement failures fall from 0.11% in the second quarter of 2008 to 0.02% in the last quarter of 2008**. For the subsample of stocks with settlement failures, this ratio falls from 0.44 to 0.18. These differences in the overall FTDs and FTDs as a percentage of shares outstanding before and after the rule change are statistically different. Consistent with these differences there is also a statistically significant drop in the average percentage of stocks on the Threshold List from 0.05% to 0.01% per day.\u201d (Welborn p. 37-38)\n\n\u201celiminating the OMM Exception reduced FTDs by 35%-39% for optionable stocks\u201d (Welborn p. 27)\n\n\u201cPrior to the financial crisis, the global OTC derivatives market grew strongly and persistently. Over the ten-year period from June 1998 to June 2008, the market\u2019s compounded annual growth rate was 25 percent. The total notional amount outstanding reached its peak of **$673 trillion in June 2008**, but just six months later it had fallen to below $600 trillion in the wake of the financial crisis. Since then, the market has stayed about 10 percent-13 percent smaller than it was at its peak. In **December 2010, the total notional amount outstanding was $601 trillion**.\u201d (clevelandfed.org)\n\nMarket Makers lose the exemption that allows them to hide FTDs in the OTC options market and six months later the OTC options market loses $73 trillion in value. That six months also includes the 2008 financial crash, but 2 years later the OTC options market is still only worth $601 trillion. The growth rate from \u201cJune 1998 to June 2008\u201d was \u201c25 percent\u201d while the growth rate from the end of 2008 to the end of 2010 was a whopping 0.0833%.\n\nLooks to me like a lot of that $73 trillion in options could have been hiding some FTDs. Even just 1 percent of those options being used for FTDs is still $730 billion in options. I don\u2019t even know what to say to that.\n\n**How was Kenny G doing in 2008?**\n\n\u201cCitadel lost $8 billion of its clients' assets in 2008 with a 55% loss\u201d (businessinsider.com)\n\nHuh, I would have thought Kenny would have been poised to make a ton of money during the 2008 crash. He did well during the 80s crash and the early 2000s crash. What was special about this crash?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2bld2eezyvk91.png?width=1672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dc874c2e51a678a42cdc993be2331acd00f4062\n\nWas Kenny hiding a huge amount of FTDs in the options market in 2008? Is that why his company started to implode?\n\nKenny G about the 2008 crash:\n\n\u201c...virtually every bank in America would have failed if the government had not intervened\u2026 every bank would have failed\u2026\u201d\n\nEvery bank was going to fail? I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s because of Mortgage Backed Securities or because every bank was swimming up to their eyeballs in FTDs. Both? Probably both.\n\n\u201c...we found ourselves fighting for our very survival\u2026\u201d - Kenny G\n\nWas Kenny fighting for survival in 2008 because he was trying to clean-up a huge FTD mess? Did your options loophole get taken away from you, Kenny?\n\n**PART 4 \u2013 FTDs, ETFs, and TRIPLE-WITCHING**\n\nMore of John Welborn. From Welborn\u2019s Three Essays:\n\n\u201cI am also the first to document a statistical relationship between ETF put option open interest and FTDs and to analyze whether ETF FTDs are related to quarterly \u201dtriple witching\u201d dates, dates when equity index futures and options expire. I find that ETF FTDs spike on the third Friday of the third month of each financial quarter, a date associated with quarterly triple witching. This result establishes that options market activity increases ETF FTDs.\u201d (Welborn p. 65)\n\nThe triple-witching effect:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn3upgm8zvk91.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd8158b9748562f6e9d19a1b500781c7e6c9da7f\n\nThere are more charts and graphs worth looking at in Welborn's Dissertation.\n\nFTDs can't handle the Triple Witches\n\n**T+**\n\nLet\u2019s go over T+ really quick. This has changed a lot and is honestly really quite confusing, so please let me know if I messed any of this up. The breakdown of important T+ dates:\n\nT+2 \u2013 Money not received in T+2 results in a failure to pay. As far as I\u2019m aware DTCC basically just takes a loan from the FED and sends a bill to the broker-dealer. The markets keep chugging. Too many failures to pay and the DTCC just cuts you off from the markets and I'm sure sues you for back-pay. They always get their money.\n\nT+3 \u2013 OTC Shares not received in T+3 results in an FTD. Too many FTDs and the DTCC cuts you off.\n\nT+6 \u2013 FTDs not received from Market Makers on ETFs in T+6 results in Reg Sho kicking in. Too many FTDs on ETFs making it past the 6 day mark and the DTCC cuts you off.\n\nFTD5 \u2013 Once you, \u201chave an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency\u201d then the security is added to the threshold list.\n\n\u201cRule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as \u201cthreshold securities,\u201d if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.\" (sec.gov \u2013 Key Points)\n\nFTD13 \u2013 If the FTDs last for 13 days then the Market Maker is forced to close. Or the DTCC cuts you off.\n\nSo let\u2019s put together a nice calendar to visualize this. We won\u2019t include any holidays. Also, the date when the security gets put on the threshold list is just an example. It\u2019s based on several factors like a registered clearing agency having 10,000 FTDs or more per security.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3d5hd5wazvk91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8c2b58b7c3709cbc2d11a86bac265b3e1a17868\n\nTo summarize, you buy a share and it must be paid for in just 2 days.\n\nIf the share doesn\u2019t arrive in your account in T+3 days then it results in an FTD.\n\nMarket Makers get T+6 days when it comes to FTDs on ETFs.\n\nIf FTDs reach a predetermined level than the stock is at risk of being listed on the threshold list.\n\nAfter 5 days over the predetermined level the stock is put on the threshold list.\n\nAfter 13 days over the predetermined level then forced buy-ins start kicking in.\n\n**T+ and Triple Witches**\n\nBack to the witching window.\n\nSo let\u2019s use an interesting moment in GMEs history as an example - March 2021:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7x7r3uslzvk91.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f309eefa018cbbb3b1ee8902e12c39e1636adf\n\nAs the triple-witching date approaches, anyone still hiding FTDs in ETF options needs to roll those options over and kick the can as hard as possible.\n\nThe first triple-witching date in 2021 was March 19th. If you\u2019re still holding on to ETF options that are hiding a mountain of FTDs on that date then you\u2019re screwed.\n\nIf FTDs start piling up on the 19th then Market Makers are at risk of putting the underlying ETF on the threshold list. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s enough FTDs on ETFs on March 19th, then Market Makers would have had until March 25th to close their FTDs and keep the ETFs off of the threshold list.\n\nIf the ETFs get put on the threshold list after those five days then Market Makers would have had until April 6th to buy-in before being forced to buy-in by Reg Sho. Thus, our witching-window is from 03.19.2021 to 04.06.2021.\n\nIf you get caught in one of these triple-witching windows with too many FTDs, the ETFs you\u2019re using to hide your shorts hit the threshold list for the 13th day, and marge knocks on your door\u2026 well, then you might just be fucked...\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bejvu6mszvk91.gif\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the triple-witching dates for 2020-2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jd0pd5vtzvk91.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04e97684d77dea170f40387848325546a480bda5\n\nSo, triple-witching dates can get really chaotic if/when Market Makers are scrambling to close out old FTDs and/or open new FTDs. The more FTDs they have getting closer to the triple-witching date the worse things are going to be. That\u2019s why on the full GME chart, you\u2019ll see spikes before the triple-witching date. For almost the past two years, GME has consistently spiked sometime before the triple-witching date before being crushed back down in price.\n\nThey\u2019re closing some of their FTDs while the price is low which causes the price to rise. Once the price gets too high they create some new FTDs and flood the market which tanks the price. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s a GME chart with the triple-witching windows highlighted:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qykxs9lyzvk91.png?width=2741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=194be0dd01df1c4f1336f9026dc7fc3b2bdbb0ec\n\nGME seems to have a pretty regular cycle of running up sometime before the triple-witching window before being crushed right back down.\n\nBased on this chart I think Citadel could be in a lot more control over the price throughout the end of the year. I have some predictions towards the end if you want to read those.\n\nThe real problem is I think Citadel just got a MASSIVE cash infusion. Kenny G knows how to make fucking money. Fuck that guy.\n\nReal quick check out this ETF growth over the years. Lots of room to hide FTDs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xiaxekj10wk91.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c4cbc3e83dd738b388e45ef4d9ea396b4c1630b\n\nNot a ton of data to go on, but it looks to me like ETFs really took off after 2008. Wonder why...\n\n**PART 5 \u2013 2001 \u2013 KENNY LOVES DRIVING CONVERTIBLES**\n\nFirst, we need some more backstory on Kenny G. I hate to admit it, but Kenny\u2019s a smart dude. He\u2019s played the game on Wall Street longer than most and he\u2019s made a shit ton of money doing it.\n\nKenny takes that $18 million from back in the 90\u2019s and turns it into $4 billion by 2001. In 2001:\n\n\u201cCitadel is getting ready to launch a new U.S. long-short equity unit that will basically involve a classic stock picking business \u2014 quite a departure from its current approach.\u201d (Meet Ken Griffin p. 5)\n\n'long-short' - remember that too\n\n\u201cPaolo says Citadel engaged in \u201cmassive\u201d short-selling, but Citadel, which declines to comment, bought only $3.75 million worth of the convertibles.\u201d (Meet Ken Griffin p. 4)\n\nConvertibles, again. I don\u2019t know if you remember when I told you to remember \u201cconvertible arb\u201d. Later in 2017, Kenny pays a pretty heft fine for what sounds to me like criminal convertible arbitrage.\n\n**2017 \u2013 FASTFILL AND SMARTPROVIDE**\n\nFastFill and SmartProvide are like the fancy PR name for Criminal Convertible Arbitrage.\n\n\u201cCitadel Securities LLC has agreed to pay $22.6 million to settle charges that its business unit handling retail customer orders from other brokerage firms made misleading statements to them about the way it priced trades.\u201d (sec.gov \u2013 press release)\n\n\u201cBut the SEC\u2019s order finds that two algorithms used by Citadel Securities did not internalize retail orders at the best price observed nor sought to obtain the best price in the marketplace. These algorithms were triggered when they identified differences in the best prices on market feeds, comparing the SIP feeds to the direct feeds from exchanges. One strategy, known as FastFill, immediately internalized an order at a price that was not the best price for the order that Citadel Securities observed. The other strategy, known as SmartProvide, routed an order to the market that was not priced to obtain immediately the best price that Citadel Securities observed.\u201d (sec.gov \u2013 press release)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71q1uhe60wk91.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6c818792caef80cb216d56fd52249e5f0de54f6\n\nNo wonder they got a $22 million fine. Wonder how much that really even cut into their profit margins though.\n\n**CONVERTIBLE ARBITRAGE**\n\nKenny G loves a convertible. The wind in his hair\u2026 the siphoning off billions of dollars from the market in tiny pieces\u2026\n\nHow does convertible arbitrage work? Once again hopefully, my diagram helps, here is an example using \u2018common stock\u2019 and \u2018preferred stock\u2019:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu1kodh90wk91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7054f52b187bbac05468ac599ff36e24e66125a2\n\nIt can get more complicated then this, but this should be all we need to know for now.\n\nNo matter where the prices end up as long as they converge and become equal you make money. Almost sounds too good to be true. You can also play it the other way and Short the \u2018preferred stock\u2019 and go long on the \u2018common stock\u2019. This is sometimes also known just as arbitrage or short-long.\n\n$5 in my example is an impressive spread. What about $26 vs about \\~$13? A $13 spread would be an incredible opportunity.\n\nHow about a real-world example that happened just this month!\n\n**PART 6 \u2013 APE COIN TAKES KENNY BACK TO HIS ROOTS?**\n\nNo offense to the AMC fans that are reading this, but holy shit\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4btcuefc0wk91.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9fb227310b717255f9b0566f8bd555b8bf4e73\n\nAPE stock was exactly what Kenny G ordered. Seriously... Damn\u2026 Not to get too into the conspiracies, but did Kenny G hand design APE stock? It\u2019s like his dream arbitrage in a moment of need.\n\nI hate to say it, but I think Citadel may have used AMC fans to pull off some insane convertible arbitrage.\n\nWhat if I told you that Kenny G could have used AMC and APE stock to make off like the bandit he is with 300 million easy? What if I told you he could have made as much as $2 billion? Or possibly even more?\n\nI believe that Citadel could have FTD\u2019d the shit out of AMC up to and around it\u2019s peak on August 11, 2022 where AMC stock reached $25.46\n\nYou might need some info on AMC and APE stock, if you\u2019re like me and haven\u2019t been following along on it that much. On August 4th, 2022 APE stock is announced through an 8-K filing.\n\nAn investor holding one share of AMC stock at the end of the day on August 19, 2022 would hold one share of AMC common stock and one share of AMC Preferred Equity aka APE in the morning on August 22, 2022.\n\nAMC is currently authorized to issue up to 1 billion APE units with a maximum of 5 billion APE. Crazy\u2026\n\n\u201cIn this case, the preferred stock shares will trade at 1/20th of the price of the AMC stock at the time of the distribution.\u201d (tastytrade.com, BATTISTA)\n\nBut, if AMC is worth around $20 and APE is basically the same thing then shouldn\u2019t APE be worth \u00bd making them both about $10. From AMC\u2019s own FAQ:\n\n\u201cEach AMC Preferred Equity unit (sometimes referred to herein as \u201cAPEs\u201d) is designed to have the same economic value as a share of Class A Common Stock (the \u201ccommon stock\u201d).\u201d (APE Dividend FAQ)\n\nThey even have the same voting rights. What\u2019s the difference between APE stock and AMC stock? Besides the fact that you can\u2019t currently convert them?\n\nIt\u2019s basically just a stock split with a new ticker. What the hell...\n\n**THE CHANOS CONVERTIBLE**\n\nA dude named Chanos saw the writing on the wall:\n\n\u201c...\"they are economically the same security, and there seems to be a lot of confusion about that,\" he said. Chanos pointed investors to AMC's APE FAQ webpage, which clearly states that\u2026\u201d (msn.com, Fox)\n\nHere\u2019s a chart on how Chanos could make $34 to $100 million easily:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku1br7pl0wk91.png?width=1386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b30007d081e18b63a14640f1915331a8ec6ae5e\n\n**CITADEL AND AMC**\n\nSo, what could Citadel have done with something like APE?\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility of up to about 188 million FTDs based on the over share vs float right after the APE split.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/caxio74n0wk91.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa633389080bdae1012ad17415eebed1d39da185\n\nA difference of 1,540,125. Did they close out all of their APE FTDs already? Probably. They just made a shit ton of money.\n\nSo, Citadel FTDs a shit ton from August 9th to August 16th. On August 22nd they\u2019re going to owe a bunch of AMC holders APE stock.\n\nSo, Citadel turns around on August 22, 2022 and starts buying up as much APE as they possibly could since it\u2019s so much cheaper than AMC.\n\nThey buy AMC when it falls down to APE levels and return both the AMC and APE FTDs. Kenny drives his fucking convertible to more profits. Damn...\n\nI put together charts for this. I\u2019m going to include 2 of the 4. The first chart that I won\u2019t include showed that with 50 million FTDs Kenny could have made around $300 million. With 100 million FTDs, I calculate that he could have made around $500 million pretty easily over the last two weeks.\n\nIn this chart, I show that 188 million FTDs on AMC over the past two weeks could lead to at least $1 billion in profit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mquekot0wk91.png?width=2765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31f5e2cdd49fdfcf064e39d2368a77bc9594ccc7\n\nThis chart shows that if Kenny could possibly push AMC even lower before settling then he could make even more:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n21vxofu0wk91.png?width=2731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26f1e8ec9b9e8d2e9a2fcb3163b294a69f5e1d1d\n\nDamn, I wonder if Kenny did something like this/is currently doing this\u2026 His history kind of points to yes.\n\n**PART 8 \u2013 CONSPIRACIES**\n\nThere are a lot of conspiracies. I think Kenny is still floating up his eyeballs in naked shorts of a bunch of companies. I also think most of Wall Street knows what\u2019s going on. I think they choose willful ignorance and prefer to act blind to the problem. At least, until it blows up in their face, then the SEC and NSCC will swoop in and make changes to Reg Sho to stop some of the loopholes.\n\nWait until shit hits the fan like they always do. Usually they can fuck over the little guys in the blow-up though.\n\n**DTCC**\n\nI think that the DTCC knows about the FTD problem, but I don\u2019t think they know the exact numbers. Their systems do allow for FTDs, but with Reg Sho in place there is a limit on how many FTDs can pile up in DTCCs internal systems.\n\nI think the DTCC/NSCC and SEC are complicit by not closing this stupid fucking ETF loophole, but I think they also know what that means. When they closed the options loophole the economy immediately fucking crashed. Yeah, MBS were hurting us, but I think the Reg Sho update that removed the options loophole is what pushed us off of the cliff.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7bzsyta1wk91.png?width=1672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b24da1eef6ddeeef6617badb49a474216ecf7a7\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2mj306gb1wk91.gif\n\nReg Sho came in fucking hot in 2008!\n\nWhat\u2019s the play here then? SEC updates Reg Sho to get rid of the ETF loophole and the economy definitely fucking craters? OR put your hopes in a guy like Kenny G? Wall Street was always going to put their money on the Citadels.\n\nSo, I\u2019m Wall Street... Do I fuck the economy and let the little guy win? Or do I act blind to the FTD loopholes, hope that Kenny G squashes retail, and pray that I don\u2019t have to enforce Reg Sho on Citadel\u2019s ass?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymri8k1j1wk91.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ecd7a26246a1d5c9597a59cbbd1a19092a4d3bf\n\nI think Citadel and any other Market Makers who have crazy amounts of FTDs are using Algos and Quants that cost billions. They have to have ways to ride the line perfectly. I think they\u2019re drowning in FTDs, but I think they\u2019re still playing the world\u2019s worst and longest game of hot potato.\n\n**Turning off the buy button was fucking bullshit though! Fuck them all for that alone.**\n\nFucking criminal.\n\n**FTD LIMIT**\n\nWhat is the limit to the FTDs? Maybe only their Algos and Quants know. But at some point their FTDs are going to explode out into the market\u2026 again...\n\nThanks for taking the time read all of this.\n\n**PART 9 \u2013 REFERENCES:**\n\nJohn Welborn \u2013 THREE ESSAYS ON NAKED SHORT SELLING AND FAILS-TO=DELIVER\n\n[http://mars.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/8157/Welborn\\_gmu\\_0883E\\_10398.pdf;sequence=1](http://mars.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/8157/Welborn_gmu_0883E_10398.pdf;sequence=1)\n\namsterdamtulipmuseumonline.com - Part 4: Tulip Mania!\n\n[https://amsterdamtulipmuseumonline.com/pages/part-4-tulip-mania](https://amsterdamtulipmuseumonline.com/pages/part-4-tulip-mania)\n\nRachael Levy \u2013 Hedge fund titan Ken Griffin describes the 'incredibly humiliating' moment his firm nearly went under\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/citadels-ken-griffin-on-2008-marking-his-biggest-career-mistake-2017-7?op=1](https://www.businessinsider.com/citadels-ken-griffin-on-2008-marking-his-biggest-career-mistake-2017-7?op=1)\n\nsec.gov \u2013 Key Points About Regulation SHO\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\n\nclevelandfed.org \u2013 Has the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Market Revived Yet?\n\n[https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2011-economic-trends/et-20110812-has-the-over-the-counter-derivaties-market-revived-yet.aspx](https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2011-economic-trends/et-20110812-has-the-over-the-counter-derivaties-market-revived-yet.aspx)\n\nsec.gov - Key Points About Regulation SHO\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\n\nsec.gov \u2013 press release - Citadel Securities Paying $22 Million for Misleading Clients About Pricing Trades\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-11](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-11)\n\nNick Battista - AMC to Issue APE Preferred Stock: Everything You Need to Know\n\n[https://www.tastytrade.com/news-insights/amc-ape-preferred-stock-all-you-need-to-know](https://www.tastytrade.com/news-insights/amc-ape-preferred-stock-all-you-need-to-know)\n\nAMC - APE Dividend FAQ\n\n[https://s25.q4cdn.com/472643608/files/doc\\_downloads/2022/ape\\_dividend\\_faq.pdf](https://s25.q4cdn.com/472643608/files/doc_downloads/2022/ape_dividend_faq.pdf)\n\nMatthew Fox \u2013 Here's how legendary short-seller Jim Chanos is taking advantage of the arbitrage between AMC stock and the new APE shares\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-legendary-short-seller-jim-chanos-is-taking-advantage-of-the-arbitrage-between-amc-stock-and-the-new-ape-shares/ar-AA113Ln8?fromMaestro=true](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-legendary-short-seller-jim-chanos-is-taking-advantage-of-the-arbitrage-between-amc-stock-and-the-new-ape-shares/ar-AA113Ln8?fromMaestro=true)\n\nJovan Medford \u2013 Convertible Arbitrage \u2013 What it is and does it Still Work?\n\n[https://algotrading101.com/learn/convertible-arbitrage/](https://algotrading101.com/learn/convertible-arbitrage/)\n\nDheeraj Vaidya, CFA, FRM - Convertible Arbitrage\n\n[https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/convertible-arbitrage/](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/convertible-arbitrage/)\n\nclevelandfed.org - Has the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Market Revived Yet?\n\n[https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2011-economic-trends/et-20110812-has-the-over-the-counter-derivaties-market-revived-yet.aspx](https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2011-economic-trends/et-20110812-has-the-over-the-counter-derivaties-market-revived-yet.aspx)\n\n[https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-ape/](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-ape/)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFTD\u2019s are hidden in ETFs.

    "title": "How to Not Lose Money on BBBY",
    "selftext": "I didn't realize I needed to do this, but THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I thought it was clear in my post; I guess for some people, it needs to be explicit. Below, I start by discussing my failures and lessons as a way to highlight that I've learned a thing or two from losses. But apparently, some of you equate failing with being bad and forever bad. Well, to you, I say, read a book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAllow me to introduce myself. I\u2019ve been lurking wsb since January 2020. I\u2019ve lost millions in opportunities and hundreds of thousands in cash. I traded GME, and I lost. I traded Tesla, and I lost. I traded the tokens which must not be named, and I won and then lost it all.\n\nMy issues have been what your issues are right now:\n\n* I was too hype for big announcements\n* I was too bullish on things that take longer\n* I bought with momentum, not against it\n* I trusted rich CEOs talking about how they care about us\n* I ignored the macro\n* I bought into any theory that went with my positions, not against them\n\nIf you want to make money, do the opposite of all the points above.\n\nNow to BBBY. I know you probably wrote me off already, but if you\u2019re still reading, listen:\n\n* GME is not going to buy BBBY, there are absolutely 0% synergies, and both BBBY and GME would go down faster than your mom does on me\n* BBBY will not sell its baby business for more money than it\u2019s worth right now. At best, you could add a 10-25% premium. The baby business is a portion of BBBY, and it\u2019s also a growth prospect\n* Selling a growth prospect reduces stock price bc the company is eliminating an opportunity to generate cash\n* imagine they sell; what will they do with the money? I\u2019ll tell you, nothing at all other than a circle jerk. Selling baby business be a negative outcome\n* daddy Cohen left already, so get over it, he\u2019s not coming back, and he took all your money, multiple times\n\nSo how do you make money?\n\nBuy puts if you have balls. According to my calculations, we\u2019ll be back at 6-7 dollars in no time. 10 to be safe.\n\nI\u2019ll see you all next week in my Lambo while you ignore me and buy more calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my positions for all the Karens in the comments:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uw48sacvpvk91.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1684b93f2ec54f32caf02f9dd37922d4a409692\n\nUPDATE: I bought more BBBY Puts. The comments are giving me more reason to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, before you say anything, yes, I know, I'm a shrimp with these positions. This is not size. RC took all my money, this is all I have left to play with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fe2ro2w6fwk91.png?width=2282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fd93f5419d992932c7b04b6ac53391cc506e631",

    "selftext": "So as person that rode the GME rocket last year and currently BBBY (you can check my post history), I'm curious why there is so much hate towards SAVA. Last post I tried, got deleted by mods for brigading so will try not to say anything that remotely resembles any brigade.\n\nSava bullish signs:\n\n1. Insiders have bought over $3M worth of shares in the last couple of weeks\n2. Third day on the Reg sho list and cost to borrow consistently over 30%\n3. Journals continue to find no evidence of data manipulation\n4. 62% of patients out of 100 improved scores on cognition tests after a year on the drug\n5. Phase 3 continues to roll on with over 400 patients enrolled as last reported\n6. This ape played the biggest YOLO in WSB history ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spfed0/largest\\_bet\\_in\\_wsb\\_history\\_sava\\_3012196439/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spfed0/largest_bet_in_wsb_history_sava_3012196439/) )\n7. SAVA has been removed from the SEC Watch List as reported by Disclosure Insight via FOIA.\n\nSo with all this, why the hate? I guess cause RC didn't buy in???? And I'm not a bag holder, sold plenty when it was above $100 but still have shares just like I do with GME and BBBY.\n\nNote: this is not financial advice. do your own DD\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that 7. SAVA has been removed from the SEC Watch List as reported by Disclosure Insight via FOIA.\n\nEdit2: moved 7 up to main list and changed bullet 2 since third day on that list!",

A nice downward trend and lots of sharp prickly spikes up (none of that slow up movement that I would get bored with, I'm here for all or nothing plays!).\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/www.google.com\\/search?q=newgg+stock ](https://preview.redd.it/wsi3xd4erqk91.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3be58c1a9e879265094bf77b209ea7737157f77b)\n\n**The Previous Due Diligence**\n\nFirst, I checked out some of the DD from very reliable resources (i.e. stocktwits the king of all reliable and truthful information)\n\n* There's been a few rumblings on Newegg (Stock ticker NEGG) and I've been watching the Stocktwits board for some DD.\n* This full on scrambled egghead made a DD as a picture that seems to check out.\n   * [https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original\\_480607704.gif](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_480607704.gif)\n   * I copied the meme, and I suggest you make one too if you got nothing out of this [https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/112528910/Guy-checks-out-red-dress-girl](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/112528910/Guy-checks-out-red-dress-girl)\n* On wallstbets there's been recent DD posts which I believe to be solid.\n   * **This post made me buy in**\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wq1yl4/why\\_i\\_believe\\_negg\\_is\\_a\\_candidate\\_for\\_a\\_runup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wq1yl4/why_i_believe_negg_is_a_candidate_for_a_runup/)\n   * This post was also made, and it checks out that the float of this ticker is low. I like these low floaters. The float is around 12 million shares and I think due for a moon landing soon (I'll talk about why it's unfairly beaten down again towards the end).\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjbf07/negg\\_rocket\\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wjbf07/negg_rocket_time/)\n\n**The financial situation**\n\nWatching the recent Sith Lord move by Ryan Cohen on BBBY, it made me nervous on companies. BBBY is slapping RC in the face right now though, so it's all good. Anyway, I took a look at Neweggs financials before my major yolo move.\n\nNormally I just buy call options and pray to the SPY lords, but again, the eggs were cheap enough to buy a massive amount. Newegg is profitable by a decent enough and a growing profit margin could be a big catalyst if they surprise on their earnings. And if their earnings suck, that's probably better for  so I can buy more cheap eggs. Either way, I'm just trying to get as many eggs as possible here.\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/www.marketwatch.com\\/investing\\/stock\\/negg\\/financials?mod=mw\\_quote\\_tab ](https://preview.redd.it/phmoua9zrqk91.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f709f7158be919299c5f747a08cc977b83a65218)\n\nThe sales/revenue for 2021 of 2.38B exceeds the market cap (fluctuating between 1.3 and 1.6 billion recently). Again,  mostly I just liked seeing green on the profit section. I rarely see green these days, so any green is pleasant. I like online businesses as well, because they seem to scale a bit better. Newegg has\n\n**The Growth Potential**\n\nThe growth potential on this one seems really strong based on where the price has been. In the past 52-weeks this has been has high as $22.20 (18 months ago it say $79+), and has been unfairly beaten down to the 3s range where it stands currently.\n\nThere are probably some bag holders here in the 10s or maybe higher. The current bag holders are likely holding a good percentage of the 12 million float. Insiders are holding about 97% of the shares right now, so that's where the 12 million float figure checks out. I suspect insiders are going to be holding this for a while and waiting for a bigger recovery. Right now it looks like about 40% of the stock is shorted and rising rapidly.\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/www.benzinga.com\\/short-interest\\/most-shorted ](https://preview.redd.it/uejd7vy4tqk91.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e958455733e3c06df91c7ab6459f33a3ac0ef56)\n\n**Thesis and Catalysts**\n\nThe short volume is consistently above 60% which implies short interest is going to keep rising. Folks just believe that people aren't buying computers anymore which is silly.\n\n* I think Newegg should normalize to a more fair evaluation (Maybe 8-10 dollar range)\n   * That'd put around a 12x multiple on the gross profits to reach a market cap over 4 billion, that is brought in. That's a normal-ish to where this stock has been. The 200 daily moving average for instance held around the 7s most of the summer (see source below).\n   * GME and AMC had longer runs, but I think Newegg spikes violently up, and then it'll float around that 8-10 zone and drift slowly up or down after.\n* Newegg has an earnings report coming up, so I think if they report good earnings some shorts may start to close position for a mini bump (thinking modest, maybe a spike to $5-6).\n   * If it's a crap earning report, I think this will get shorted more and then its even more of a rocket move later in the year around Black Friday Sales.\n* With NVidia's earning report somewhat sucking, I think Newegg is in a position to start getting some more leverage.\n   * Newegg launched a new laptop finder tool ([https://www.newegg.com/tools/laptop-finder](https://www.newegg.com/tools/laptop-finder)) and has been doing a few other developer events to get the word out. Back to school sales, hybrid work, and the general refresh should help keep sales coming in strong.\n      * Newegg has a good Direct to consumer and Direct to Business ([https://www.neweggbusiness.com/](https://www.neweggbusiness.com/)) options. They also have more recently a way to finance payments (using affirm for example [https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/affirm/](https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/affirm/)) that is very consumer friendly.\n   * I think management is making a lot of right decisions to grow the business and I think NEGG management is waiting to grow the company and let their eggs hatch when the time is right. The time is right when the eggs get very big (think Ostrich size eggs, not the eggs you get at the grocery store).\n\n[Daily moving averages https:\\/\\/www.barchart.com\\/etfs-funds\\/quotes\\/NEGG\\/technical-analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/ngsdm65q0rk91.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7914634b2b306f61bb0dde4b40dfad392b865a9c)\n\n**This stock was beaten down unfairly**\n\nIn December of 2020 the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) said they were basically going to audit a bunch of foreign (i.e. Ali Baba like) companies. I think since Newegg has Chinese ownership they were lumped into this category.\n\n* After actually taking 5 seconds to run a ctrl+f on the list here, Newegg was not to be found: [https://www.sec.gov/hfcaa](https://www.sec.gov/hfcaa)\n   * I believe the slow drop in price this summer has been FUD spreading, see the next bullet though.\n* According to this story here (released today, August 28) U.S.-China relations just got better as they figured out a process. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-china-relations-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-boosting-the-prospects-of-these-three-stocks-11661682894](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-china-relations-just-got-a-whole-lot-better-boosting-the-prospects-of-these-three-stocks-11661682894)\n* Again, NEWEGG was never involved or at risk of de-listing, but the FUD spread wild and the price dripped down.\n\n**Did I buy some Eggs**\n\nAs you now know, I'm putting (almost) all my eggs in one basket here and now have a position of about 14,100 shares at Newegg. It fits in to my red portfolio, and I'm going to buy more eggs and tell you about it here.\n\nPapa Powell wants to make it hard on me to make money this year it looks like, but I think now is as good a time as ever to dive in. If it goes lower and my trash portfolio gets obliterated, I'll just make some scrambled eggs at my new job at McDonalds (morning shift).\n\n**What Kind of Egghead are you?**\n\nI'm a hard boiled egg. So consider buying some eggs now or just post a bunch of bad egg jokes here, I don't care. More egg jokes = more profits for us all. **\"When we get to the egg farts we know we're winning. We will run to the moon in great fear when we smell egg farts.\" - Aristotle**\n\n**So remember**\n\n1. buy computer parts (preferably from newegg)\n2. Put your eggs in this basket (I heard the Easter bunny won't like you for taking his eggs though)\n3. This ticker keeps popping every few months. The lower share price means rocket time.\n4. This ticker for now fits perfectly in my all red portfolio until I take the shorts eggs for $$$",

    "selftext": "Good evening apes,\n\nI've been a long time lurker in this sub (well before GME) and nowadays it looks like the reason behind every play has been dumbed down to \"Ok but is that shit going to squeeze?\". Well listen up mfers, the mother of all squeezes has slowly been building up over the last...decade and it's been under the radar. What the fuck is it you ask? Uranium, you apes, it's literally in the fucking title. That's right, since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the whole space has been going down the shitter up until recently.\n\nWe can even say the whole space's been in a bear market since '07, until recently when it started to curl back up.\n\n[15 years bear market. Spot peaked at $140 in 2007.](https://preview.redd.it/uxp22zmluqk91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c46e445436e91329ddf01f512ecaaeb5a95ba9)\n\nAs you can see, the spot price peaked in 2007 at around 140$. Now, you might say \"Ok who gives a shit about nuclear?\" Well, not only is the space ready for a fucking squeeze to infinity, the fundamentals behind the play are even more insane. To name a few:\n\n* Covid-19 has halted the production of many mines for 2 years +. Since the spot was already below      its break-even point (aka it costs more to mine than what it can be sold for), most producers were only barely producing or not producing at all. *This contributes to lowering the supply.*\n* Utilities (those who actually use the ore to produce electricity aka nuclear plants) have a somewhat inelastic demand and don't usually hedge (for you apes, this means they don't buy in advance when they expect the spot price to go higher). Since the ore itself only represents a fraction of the total costs of utilities, most don't bother hedging themselves. *Inelastic demand = good.*\n* Last week we saw news coming from Japan stating that they were restarting their nuclear reactors,      building new ones, and extending the life of current ones. China, India and many other countries have also started building new reactor plants. *This contributes to increasing the demand.*\n* A physical uranium trust was set up in July 2021 (Sprott Physical Uranium Trust) and its sole mission      is to buy the current physical uranium spot and raise cash (to buy even more uranium spot, see where this is going?). *This contributes to lowering the supply.*\n* The space of Uranium dwarves other commodities such as Oil and Gas. To give you an idea, the biggest producer is Cameco has a market cap of just north of 11B. CVX (Chevron) has a market cap of 333B. *This means you apes can have a REAL IMPACT since the space is so thinly traded.*\n\nThese are only a fraction of the tailwinds behind the Nuke play. Will the spot reach $140 like it did in 2007? Fuck do I know. Are the fundamentals better than they were at the time? 10x better, not even close. Also, inflation mfers. I could go on and on, but I feel like 95% of you won't even get to this part.\n\nTickers: URA, CCJ + many others I'm not allowed to write here.\n\nI've been long the space since early 2021 and have been riding the waves.\n\nStay safe apes\n\n\\#NUKEMOON",

    "selftext": "What\u2019s up apeists and regards. Apes are regarded but not in the positive way. Apes are actually regarded.\n\nAllow me a moment to explain\u2026\n\nDo you actually like BBBY (the retail store) or any of their other brands?\n\nMy mom used to take me there as a kid and I remember she\u2019d walk out with 7-10 items $450 later like clockwork.\n\nWhat do they sell, idk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Random ass sharper image shit and pillows or something?\n\nMy wife sometimes takes me to buy buy baby and we always walk out with like a $650 car seat or some shit. It\u2019s absolutely regarded.\n\nI hate their stores, they\u2019re boring as fuck and I usually want to slit my wrists after walking around in their aimlessly for 3 hours while my wife buys soda streams or some bullshit.\n\nHow does this relate to GME, AMC, etc\u2026.\n\nI also hate GameStop. Talk about overpriced, customer fucking bullshit. When MW2 came out I sold my PS2 and my entire collection of games, all of my guitar hero controllers, and still owed them like $20 just to get my copy. They likely turned around and made at least a couple hundred on all of my stuff. Why do I like this company? I don\u2019t\u2026. Fuck them.\n\nRemember AMC ??? Oh yeah, I remember being 16 and spending $80 to take my girlfriend to the movie, and get snacks. I hate AMC. \n\nWould I ever own shares of these companies? Absolutely not. The fact that these businesses still exist is insane. The internet solves all of the problems that these companies set out to address when they were first established. They\u2019re absolute horseshit.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with the fact that people have traded and made a fuck ton of money on options contracts that use these companies shares as the underlying.\n\nYou get inherent leverage with OTM options contracts, and can put up much lower amounts of capital to achieve the same results that you would have if you held the correlated position in shares alone. If you\u2019re buying long options, you\u2019ll also never end up as a shareholder of a dogshit company (unless you want to be). \n\nMost options contracts expire worthless so you\u2019re also (most importantly) not giving the board of directors free money by way of share price increase that they can turn around and dilute you with. \n\nDilution is a good thing if you actually believe in the company because they\u2019re effectively raising cash that they can use for development. If you\u2019re giving a company that sucks a ton of money, they\u2019re just going to turn around a give their entire board raises for \u201cdoing a great job\u201d for the quarter. \n\nPhilosophically apes seem to be preaching a dystopian reality in which they\u2019re all standing together and getting rich together and fucking over hedge funds but in reality the only people getting fucked over are the retail investors. Hedge funds are hedged (duh) if they have a manager that\u2019s not artistic and can take on the losses (if any). Market makers make money on the trading volume, the company\u2019s board gets paid, long term holders can finally sell their garbage shares, and options traders make and lose money like usual.\n\nSTOP BUYING SHARES of COMPANIES YOU DONT BELIEVE in. STOP EXERCISING SHARES that are OTM. \n\nIf you do, it\u2019s nobodies fault but your own. Stop bitching and putting more regulatory scrutiny on our backs. You are burning money. This is a CASINO, not an investment club. \n\nRegulators either don\u2019t give a fuck,or don\u2019t get this game. Any regulation \u201cto protect us\u201d literally just makes it harder for little guys to have any shot at life changing money. \n\nPSA\u2026 I am not a financial advisor. Keep being an ape if you want.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is not FUD. I have and do trade options on $bbby $GME $AMC. \n\nRemember when we used to trade Lumber Liquidators and it wasn\u2019t a cult?\n\nTL;DR\n\nDo your own research and don\u2019t necessarily invest with the hive mind\u2026. \n\nSimple DD\n\nEDIT: \n\nFor all of you conspiracy theorist hardos. Here\u2019s a fun trivia fact:\n\nBy volume the majority of Robinhood\u2019s option orders were not routed to Citadel up to and during the $GME saga. They were routed to [Wolverine](https://www.wolve.com/), but I haven\u2019t seen a single post of outrage related to this market maker? They also have a [hedge fund](https://www.wolvefunds.com/). \n\nWhy no mention? Because we are in an echo chamber, and we all see what we want to see.",

    "title": "Great news regarding BBBY strategic plan",
    "selftext": "BBBY has declining revenue and a relatively fixed cost structure yet it has a new plan to reduce the number of stores and cut labor so that it can solve its debt problem.  Since when does shrinking your business while migrating towards lower margin national brands solve a debt problem?  It will never fucking work.\n\nEverybody says the valuation of BBBY is $900 million.  Complete BS.   This conveniently ignores $5 billion of debt plus $500 million in additional debt (despite the friendlier \"financing\" term,) that is tacked on putting the same money losing business further in the hole..  If BBBY was debt free it would might have a $900 million valuation.   I doubt it though.  The company has no business.  Businesses are supposed to make money.  A company that is bleeding money at a clip of $100 million a month is not a business.   BBBY has 6 months to solve its problems.   Does anyone really think it will turn a profit in 6 months?\n\nEverybody mentions price to sales in the valuation metric for BBBY.  Its fucking stupid.   Companies that valued on sales have very high margin businesses (ie software business like Salesforce) that are growing and or that have a platform that is scaleable (ie Amazon) so that it is clear their cash flow improves in the future.  BBBY has a negative margin business with sales that are shrinking, and it simply can never compete with Amazon.\n\nBBBY does not have a dominant web presence, it does not have state of the art automated warehouses in every city, and it does not have drivers that already travel to your neighborhood every day spreading their cost of delivery over many more items.   Amazon can offer its private label products at a far lower cost, and these products are eating away at the business of national brands in textiles and at Bed Bath and Beyond.  The trend is your friend.  BBBY will never be able to compete in e commerce with Amazon, and the shift back towards national brands will not work.  It is too late.  The BBBY retail cost structure is a noose around its neck.\n\nI keep hearing about how GME squeezed and BBBY can do the same.  Not a comparable situation.  First, the squeeze happened when the entire stock market was valuing companies with no earnings based on a negative real cost of capital.  More importantly it was a Bull market where the Fed was buying every asset in sight.   Now the situation has reversed, the Fed is selling every asset, and we are in a Bear market and money losing companies have been hammered.  Sure Gamestop has raised a ton of cash at equity prices that were 50x higher than its low.   Still, it burned over $200 million in the last quarter, and its cash will last until the end of next year at best.  There will be a day of reckoning for all of these stocks unless redditors keep feeding these money losing pigs.  Ryan Cohen will not save it.  You can bet your ass the day will come when he will post his 13D with some high priced calls and liquidate his stock in short order.\n\nThe reddit \"team\" strategy of we are are going to squeeze others only works if no one sells.  AS someone said, investing is a dog eat dog world.  No one gives a shit about you.  Especially here.Bulls and snake oils salesmen are the only ones with a voice due to downvoting.   You can bet your ass whenever something truly bad happens someone will post some new stupid ass bull hypothesis based on complete bullshit (ie Today was really a good thing when the Company filed an S-3 shelf offering allowing it to simply post a \"supplement\" and take $120 million from you suckers.  Once the first tranche of 12 million is sold, BBBY can and will cut and paste the same supplement again and again until all 900 million shares are taken by dumbass bidders.  Shelf registrations are used by penny stock pump and dump scams.  Great way to steal money if you are the company.   Rarely if ever good for investors).\n\nEveryone says they don't sell but last time I checked 160 million shares have sold in the last 2 days.  Someone is selling, and the price has fallen as a result.  It is a simple supply and demand situation.    More sellers and the stock goes down.    How often does someone say I sold in this sub?  Not too often, because if you do you can't even be here.  Karma silences reason.\n\nTo pull off a short squeeze, this stock needs a positive catalyst.  Ie an activist investor, or a plan that actually works where they can make money in the future.  Sorry but borrowing another $500 million just means the enterprise value of this company is over $6 billion.  That debt is there. Its not going away.  And the market says its not getting repaid, or you wouldn't be able to buy it for 20% of the amount borrowed by BBBY.   When a company's sales are not profitable, it does not have a business.   BBBY does not have a business.  Its only chance of survival is convince you all to feed it money every quarter.   There is no way in hell that this group will do that forever..\n\nIt may seem like you are among friends on your side, but only some of the people here are your friends.  Most sell you out every single day.  Sorry, it is the fucking truth. Don't be a dumbsass.\n\nIf you disagree, what is the end game here?  To continue to convince the masses that ponzi schemes in in stocks going out of business always work?  Businesses that lose shit tons of cash eventually die.   Maybe not this week, but at some time.  Shorting and ponzi shemes have been around for 100 or more years.   Polaroid, Blockbuster, Toys R US, Borders books, Tower Records, GM, Kodak.  They all BK'd.   No amount of trickery could save them.\n\nIf it does squeeze, do you really fucking think someone will give you a signal of when to cash out?  Fuck no.  They will cash out and then post \"bought more.\"  No one will ever say oh shit has turned, time to get out.  What is really crazy is that after Ryan Cohen sold, proving he thought the plan sucked, and he used trickery to pump the stock, snake oil bag holding salesmen immediately started talking about a merger with Gamestop.  Remember what was supposed to happen today?  The merger and spinoff of buybuybaby DID NOT happen, but no worries.  Move the goal post again.  Ignore that a billionaire who was made rich by this forum just screwed all of you, and also ignore that he might be much more clever than you and he fucking sold down to ZERO.  Thats his faith in this play.  ZERO.  \n\nGet a fucking life.   Bet on a real company.\n\nPS.  yes I own puts.  I'm up, though only slightly, and I can lose the money as well.  It is less than 1% of my net worth.  Not at all scared.  Just sick of a forum with a bunch of loud mouth, bullying liars with no fucking brain.",

I started by sharing my experience of losing money and making bad trades to share my mistakes with you in hopes that you avoid them. But no. You don't like the truth. Some of you geniuses deduced that since I had lost money in the past, you should disregard me. And mind you, this was self-disclosed information.\n\nWhen a trader comes to you and brags about all winners, be careful. When a trader comes to you and shares their losses, learn from them.\n\nI want to dunk on all the 50 IQ comments, but I won't. I'm on that eat pray love tip, and you should be too.\n\nSo look, I'm up about 70% since my play yesterday, but this shit show isn't over.\n\n**What's the next move?**\n\nThe next big catalyst is an ATM stock offering. What this means is BBBY will issue stocks at whatever the price of shares are at the open market at the time of issuance, and your chicken little Reddit colleagues are going to buy it up because 'short squeeze.'\n\n**How do we get ready for this play?**\n\nI know this is a new concept, but we **wait**. Let's understand what comes next and what the timeline for the stock offering is. Once we have some insight, we buy more puts. Bag holding is for cu... it's not good.\n\nBBBY is a death spiral into oblivion. The difference between BBBY and GME is that GME's daddy is RC. BBBY is RC's side piece, and he's officially dumped her. Instead, BBBY is relying on 'executives' who still think it's 1990 and the world hasn't changed, and they have to go play golf this afternoon. They're out of touch. But they're also not going to give up control. They refuse to see what's happening around them, much like the perma bulls on here. It's the perfect short, for now, at least. Things change, so don't marry your strategy. Marry the gains. Let's see how this plays out. For now, I'm waiting. I still have some puts open expiring next Friday.\n\nI'll try to post when I buy puts again for BBBY if anyone is interested. Otherwise, I'll assume you all hate money and me, and I'll ride off in my temporary honda accord until I can afford a lambo.\n\nOh, also, for the 5th graders in here, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.",

    "title": "Squeeze is 100% happening. Let me explain.",
    "selftext": "Let\u2019s look at the facts:\n\nFirst off: Today\u2019s announcement.\nIt\u2019s a wide misconception in this sub that the announcement was negative in any way, shape or form. The company plans to cut the worst performing 150 stores, which is less than 10% of all. They\u2019re also going to sack two least useful C-Level executives, and they\u2019ve secured a loan of more than $1B. \n\nAll these things (and the additional share offering which I\u2019m about to talk about) will make the company boatloads of money, effectively taking even the slightest possibility of a bankruptcy in the foreseeable future, OFF the table. \n\nNow, the filing. It\u2019s capped at 12 million shares, which is the absolute maximum that they have a probability of offering, so absolute worst case scenario is the stock value drops by 15%. Given that the estimated real valuation should be around 70-80$, that still puts the current price at a criminally underrated position. Also, don\u2019t forget that history repeats itself. GME and AMC both made the same filing before they mooned too!\n\nSo far I\u2019ve given one reason for a squeeze, (the shorts\u2019 entire bet/argument was that BBBY was going bankrupt, and that\u2019s entirely called off so there\u2019s absolutely no reason not to exit their positions) as well as a reason that it\u2019s one of the most undervalued stocks out there (see above). \n\nIs that all? Nope. \nWhat everyone seems to have forgotten about is RegSHO, which a price drop doesn\u2019t deactivate. Naked hedgies are still required by law to buy all their FTD\u2019s by friday, and market makers are by Sept. 20th. \n\nLook at this from their POV: they have no money left, no power, and are about to be fucked by the SEC. This LITERALLY can\u2019t go tits up for us. I\u2019m therefore making a BAN BET that BBBY will reach $50 at the very least over the next six months.\n\nPositions: 911 shares at $10.11, 49 shares at $14,13 and 30 shares at $10.68\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/xtUoCNz) [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/oCIqXsd) [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/SrL5gHH)\n\nNot Financial Advice\n\nEdit: Everyone is asking about the $80 valuation. Outdated but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/whvnwk/why_i_believe_bbby_will_go_north_of_80/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) guy explains it better than me\n\nEdit 2: Since u/needyouonthatwall (nice AFGM reference btw) asked for a watermelon bet, I\u2019ll fuck a watermelon with the face of L\u00e9a Seydoux when it hits 69$. LFG \ud83c\udf49\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd11\n\nEdit 3: u/brokendigitalclock just informed me of something very, VERY interesting: fucking Robinhood just erased the buy button again. My region doesn\u2019t have RH so if people who have it who know what\u2019s going on can provide some info that would be great.\n\nEdit 4: I guess it\u2019s working now? Idk what happened but sus for sure",

    "selftext": "Bed Bath and Beyond filed to sell stock in a shelf offering.  The claim that management is offering only 12 million shares is really really misleading.\n\nWith a shelf offering, the company can offer an UNLIMITED amount of stock, making a squeeze impossible, especially since they have debt trading at 20% of the face value of the bonds.\n\nPer the prospectus:\n\n\u201cEach time we offer securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering,\u201d the filing said.\n\nSo there really is no end to the supply of stock available for sale, and as long as the company needs money, it will tap into irrational markets to sell stock.\n\nA squeeze is just not possible.   PERIOD.  End of story.\n\nI am not surprised at all that there is a new spin to the long thesis however.  Afterall, we saw  t+1, t+2 t+182 with GME.  As time goes on GME will tank as well,  we are already seeing it. I suspect soon it will have more debt than cash and it continues to bleed money. \n\nWhatever happens with either however, you can bet there will be a lying idiot trying to concoct a story to attract gambling money from the masses of idiots into this company, which is clearly dying.   Do your own DD, shop for comforters on BBBY and Amazon, trying checking out of both sites.  BBBY does not even appear to carry its own inventory anymore.  There is no way they can compete, and the results bear this out.\n\nThis greater fool theory of investing really confounds me.

I figured the risk to reward was great and am glad I was able to get out with a minimal loss. \n\nFor the people complaining about the entire WSB subbredit flooded with BBBY posts, your wish has come true, you will see a chunky exodus.

But now, likely due to the recent mainstream coverage, they've been able to secure more money to stay afloat for a little longer. This doesn't change the fact that it's an unprofitable business that's highly in debt. Be honest with yourselves and admit that the only thing your investment has going for it is a short squeeze. It's dumbfounding to see people post about BBBY closing stores, cutting staff and diluting shares as GOOD news! As if they're going to go online and magically become the next amazon for bath towels. The truth is that all these companies, BBBY, GME and AMC, are all unprofitable and well past their primes. I swear, if this sub was around during 2008, y'all would all be investing in blockbuster stock and a short squeeze probably would've occurred. Then, due to the attention, they'd probably raise some more money and dilute shares to continue losing money for an extra few years. But the ending would still be the same: Netflix and streaming still would've taken over and blockbuster's business model would continue to be outdated. The same way amazon shipping and digital games have caused BBBY's and GME's business models to become outdated. All I'm asking is for a little self-awareness; quite frankly, the sub would have a lot more respect if yall did. These aren't good businesses, that's why they have such MASSIVE short interests!!!! So please, for the sake of the sub, stop acting like these businesses are good investments and acknowledge that the only thing their stock prices have going for them is a short squeeze.",

    "selftext": "You really have to just hand it to Wall Street when it comes to this one. I'm in awe.\n\nGamestop, AMC, and now Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. What do they all have in common? They were failing, badly mismanaged retail businesses that had vastly overexpansive physical footprints in the face of obvious digital transitions. And importantly, big banks and institutional money had participated in this failure and lent these failing businesses *billions* of dollars despite them having no future. Banks were facing the prospect of getting pennies on the dollar for this debt in bankruptcy court, taking potentially billions in losses.\n\nNone of these businesses were possibly going to be able to generate enough cash flow from normal business operations to cover their obligations. But amazingly, an \"organic\" wave of retail interest causes stock prices to go up and gives them a chance to make the money a different way: take it directly out of the pockets of idiots on this subreddit. All three companies jump at the chance to issues shares and raise cash.\n\nWhat's the net effect?\n\n$GME: raises a billion dollars from redditors, pays off hundreds of millions of dollars of debt to the big banks, closes hundreds of stores, fires thousands of hourly workers. Built a meme generator marketplace.\n\n$AMC: raises billions of dollars from redditors, which is just getting sucked up by the banks as the company desperately tries (and fails) to reduce its debt load. Also some of it went to a gold mine. Still desperately trying to get more redditor money today.\n\n$BBBY: closing 150 stores, shedding thousands of hourly workers, and now going to attempt to squeeze a few hundred million out of whatever redditors are left to pay down debt.\n\nI'm not really a conspiracy-minded person. But here we've got a situation where there's millions of people who are (justifiably) angry at Wall Street. That anger could be channeled in so many different ways that might threaten Wall Street's interests - effective political organization, union building, etc. And somehow we've ended up with a \"movement\" where millions of disaffected redditors sit inside, staring at their computer screens, *cheering* as their money is used to pay off the big banks' bad bets.\n\nIt's truly incredible, you really have to just laugh.",

At current prices they can only net 120 mil which is peanuts.  The company is also waiting for the squeeze to high 3 digits so they can net at least a couple billions from the share sale (to wipe out their debt and raise additional working capital). That's exactly what GME did.\n\nRemember GME also issued 5 mil shares and the price still held at around $150\n\nIf in doubt - remember - GME went from $420 to $35 and back to $350. (That's inspite of the buy button manipulation by Sh\\*thood &amp; Sh\\*tadel)\n\nWord gets out in the big money circle very quickly... so If they start covering, other Big Money will also pour into the stock to try and make a quick buck further raising the price higher.\n\nThe way people have piled into BBBY, this has potential to squeeze higher than GME.\n\nSo sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

    "selftext": "Last year\u2019s GameStop meme stock phenomenon is making its way to the big screen, as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Pete Davidson, \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d actor Paul Dano, \u201cPineapple Express\u201d star Seth Rogen and Marvel Cinematic Universe regular Sebastian Stan are set to star in \u201cDumb Money.\u201d\n\nA group of Reddit-based retail investors on the Wall Street Bets page boosted shares of GameStop in 2021 in an effort to hammer short-selling hedge funds.\n\nThe ensuing meme-stock-mania resulted in sharp swings in the company\u2019s share price, worrying Wall Street and recently impacting other retailers like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Activist investor and meme stock king Ryan Cohen is chairman of GameStop and had bought more than 10% of Bed Bath\u2019s stock before cashing out of the troubled home-good retailer.\n\n\u201cDumb Money\u201d is based on Ben Mezrich\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cThe Antisocial Network,\u201d which was published in September 2021. Previous Mezrich works include \u201cThe Accidental Billionaires,\u201d which was adapted into the Oscar-winning Facebook movie \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d and the MIT blackjack scandal book \u201cBringing Down the House,\u201d which was adapted into the Kevin Spacey movie \u201c21.\u201d\n\nA rights sale for \u201cDumb Money\u201d is set to kick off this month at this year\u2019s Toronto Film Festival, according to Variety.\n\n\u201cDumb Money\u201d will be directed by Craig Gillespie, who previously collaborated with Stan on his 2017 film \u201cI, Tonya\u201d and the Hulu series \u201cPam &amp; Tommy.\u201d Like \u201cDumb Money,\u201d both of those projects focused on real-life events involving disgraced figure skating Olympian Tonya Harding, actress and model Pamela Anderson and Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee.\n\nFilming on \u201cDumb Money\u201d is set to begin this month.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/gamestop-meme-stock-movie-dumb-money-seth-rogen-pete-davidson.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/gamestop-meme-stock-movie-dumb-money-seth-rogen-pete-davidson.html)",

Also it basically confirmed that RC does not want anything to do with the company. He was the beacon of hope and one of the main reasons it garnered as much attention as GME and AMC. \n\n2. I honestly thought this would dump harder after the news. The BBBY subreddit is still holding strong and filled with HODLERS right now. \n\n3. Bagholders and people who are waiting for a sneeze now have to deal with 12 million dilution and retail shorting/buying puts at 15 to 25$ range. Which would be a great area to short if the volume is not great. \n\n4. For some reason, I don't think this play is over (mainly because of the gaps)...but I don't think we will see much higher than 25$ without a BIG catalyst. \n\n5. How on earth did a 20 year old who borrowed 25 million from his \"family\" manage to sell millions of shares at the highs and BBBY didn't do an ATM then? Why would you decide to do an ATM after the share price crashes hard?\n\n6. Do you think it would have ran as much as GME if RC did not sell?",

    "selftext": "# These \"FTDs\", are they in the room with us right now?\n\nI'm going to keep this brief and get straight to the point, FTD's are very likely to be the cause of major runups in BBBY. FTD data will tell us that FTDs are resolved magically in their following trading days, but the experienced apes among us from the GME saga will know that firms like Shitadel and Suspecthana are masters at hiding FTD from cropping up. That why BBBY not being on RegSHO's Threshold List doesn't really matter.\n\nLook at this chart, every runup big or small has always been after a major FTD Due Date. Each run occurs on average 3-5 trading days after when they become due, although the size of each run varies as they are also subject to fundamental factors like news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iaj0cb6fkpl91.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc6fee563b52b8ca4ae1c126c7a91d8940cd1301\n\n# \n\n# We are wrong about T+35 (I think)\n\nI'm sure most of us have seen this table below.

I do however think that the stock market is a pyramid scheme and this sub is prime real estate for insiders consolidating an even greater percentage of wealth. It\u2019s a casino, sure but I can assure you, the stock market is rigged for the small club laughing at us from their ivory tower. GME did nothing to actually affect any prominent hedge funds (Melvin is small-time compared to BlackRock). Wait another twenty-thirty years; there will be another \u201chistoric\u201d victory for retail traders to rope the next generation in for the hedge fund cash cow. I don\u2019t like it either but it is what it is.",

    "selftext": "This is more a commentary on the sub meta, but overlaps with a lot of online societal issues. Being one hundred percent sincere, a lot of you are showing signs of radicalization and genuine cult like behavior over meme stocks. \n\nThis sub has always had its in jokes about gambling addictions and going long on $ROPE that alluded to some real life issues members would occasionally experience, but this is different. Ever since $GME, this sub has morphed into a genuine echo chamber which is fed by bot farms giving individual investors a false feeling of social support and acceptance for logically indefensible investing habits. Lets take a look at $BBBY. The CFO was witnessed by his wife committing suicide and the conspiracy theorists are already running out theories that this was to cover up nefarious activity by short sellers rather than just a man giving into despair. If you are looking at these theories and using them to justify continuing holding bags in $BBBY, I am talking to you. You need help. Talk to a friend or family IRL, delete reddit for a while, and just decompress.\n\nThis is a sub for making money. If your DD stops being about earnings reports and trend analysis, and starts being about international financial conspiracies killing the executives of a failing retailer, rethink what you\u2019re actually doing and how you got here.\n\nEdit: The cultists have found me out. I\u2019ve spent years undercover on this sub in preparation for this very piece of FUD. It\u2019s just here to hold them back from that glorious moment that is definitely just around the corner where they will make millions, the hedgies will go bankrupt, and the NYSE and SEC will do nothing to stop the stock market erupting in turmoil.",

    "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)\n\nI'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:\n\n1. Earnings\n2. Major Economic Events\n3. My Watchlist\n4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\n**Earnings this week that I will play**\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow i play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don\u2019t  go over 5% size on any earning\u2019s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - GitLabs - $GTLB\n\n* DevOps software company\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) &amp; Revenue $94m\n* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently\n* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings\n* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.\n* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)\n* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish\n\n**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - NIO inc - $NIO:\n\n* EV car manufacturer\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST\n* Estimate eps ($0.17) &amp; revenue $1.45b\n* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.\n* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings\n* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY\n* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting\n* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one\n\nAfter Close - Gamestop - $GME\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) &amp; Revenue $1.27B\n* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.\n* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings\n* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY\n* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss\n\n**Thursday 8 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - Docusign - $DOCU\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m\n* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings\n* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week\n* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here\n\n**Friday 9 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - Kroger - $KR\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m\n* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings\n* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only\n\n**Major Economic events this week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2\n\nSo  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug\n\nWednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July\n\n12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech\n\nThursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech\n\nFriday\n\n10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories\n\n12:30 - Fed Walker Speech\n\nAs  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.\n\nMarket  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "selftext": "We are trading eerily similar to 2008. From the ATH on January 4, we rejected twice off of the 200 daily EMA (April 21 and August 16), like how we did in 2008 (and in the dot com bust of 2000)\n\n[SPY During the 2008 Crash](https://preview.redd.it/6v5uvxya93m91.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb9e64c59684169b057dd0232fd034b58cb4b03c)\n\nUnlike some doomsayers, I put my money where my mouth is. My portfolio is 85% short/put positions against SPY. The other 15% in long/call options in meme stocks (GME and BBBY). My portfolio is 100% options. Yes, my meme stock calls are bleeding right now, but they expire in January 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Labor Day](https://preview.redd.it/pebn3ype93m91.png?width=1470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b29a5a4a8feb491e994f03e9a38bd75d0d4ff4)\n\nI entered most of my put positions the week of August 15th where we ran up and perfectly bounced off of the daily 200 EMA (\\~431.5). I deployed about 50k.\n\nI plan on selling most of my short term dated puts (the ones that expire in 1-2 months) into CPI release on September 13th and the interest rate hike announcement on September 21st, since we might see one final bear rally hurrah before we capitulate and crash sometime in Q4 2022 or Q12023.\n\nIf we do end up rallying up throughout the rest of September and October, I'll use profits to enter new put positions that expire in March/June 2023. Entry levels would be the corridor between the 50 daily EMA and the 200 daily EMA range (maybe 405-425 depending on how big and long this rally lasts, who the fuck knows)\n\nIf you're still sitting on the sidelines and aren't at least 100% cash yet, it's now or never to consider being short to hedge yourself against this possible shitstorm. You only live once. Tickets to tendieland are going fast.\n\nOR you can continue buying the dip like a retard, just don't whine when your DCA cost average is still deep red and it takes years for you to recover your losses, assuming your ass doesn't paper hand after you get laid off (we're in the beginning of a recession...as it progresses unemployment spikes)\n\nDisclaimer: I've been a gay perma bear for years now. I'm young (late 20s) so if I lose everything, worst comes to worst, I move back in with my parents and start over.",

    "selftext": "So I'm the guy that wrote the DD about the housing crisis that made it to the front page of Reddit before sitewide admins deleted it and gave me a hate speech warning, there's a copy up on another forum you can get to in my profile that I can't link to here because the wall street firms running the various finance subreddits like drama. I started looking for a new place to live and listed my house shortly after posting that.  I'm also the guy who wrote [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vb7qjp/theres_going_to_be_a_global_food_shortage_heres/) about the coming food shortage.\n\n**TL;DR Market go down, food go up, bank account go up more, buy large pizza with profits.**\n\nGood news kids, there's no wannabe Riddler nonsense in this post, just straight answers and hard numbers, plus screenshots of my positions.  I've got five figures in already and more than twice that on the way waiting to clear settlement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# First, the Market Crash\n\nI'm going to try to keep this shorter, simpler, and more picture based than normal.  Here's the TA for the market crash, I'm going to show you the same picture twice in a row.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uizu3lilezl91.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229b4aeda36926b5fba092bcdeb02aa69a7b2e9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h271ldreezl91.jpg?width=896&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e542e2ab957901d10532ebacc6e1c4ced09903b3\n\nI have SPY going down to 300ish within the next two months - ie by the end of October.  Resistance around 390, 385, and 360 (plus maybe 340).  Once we lose the previous low of the year at 363, it should be a skydive run down to the new Morgan Collar floor, which I think is around 300.  The century long trendline/mean reversion point is a little under 200, pretty sure that's why Burry has the final low at 184.  I've got the final low at 60-90, ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/salggk/behold_your_new_god_manbearape_the_vice_president/) I've been saying this for awhile) because I think we dip well below that mean/trend before recovering.\n\nFor reference, my levels for the first bottom after the peak were 350-380, then a run up to 420-450, before the real crash started (the real crash is the part we're on now).  I did not think the run down from 430 to 390 would happen as fast as it did, so I've taken a lot of 10% profits that could have gone as high as 800-900% over the last few days.  Hey, nobody's perfect, and green is green, take profits people.  I can proudly say I hit the end of day and overnight bounce from 9/1 to 9/2 and flipped back short again almost perfectly, which is incredibly rare for anyone except Domino from Deadpool or Prince from Bullet Train - and more luck than skill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Second, the Housing Crash\n\nIf you haven't read ANY of my DD's about housing and why it's in trouble, ([here's one from a year ago on why the \"not enough houses\" narrative was bogus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/)) well, they're all on my profile, but given that you probably don't care, this post someone else made about what they'd done pretty much perfectly sums it up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxf16yorizl91.jpg?width=670&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bb7c5449ef9c60412525a4134b05ceb94aa8aab\n\nBasically, Wall Street is only responsible for about 1/3rd of the \"cash buyers\" of houses you're seeing in the market.  The rest are geniuses like this guy who used margin, asset backed loans, and inflated equity values to buy property with \"cash\" and accidentally loaded up all kinds of risk that nobody picked up on.  Also see the video of the \"4880 units, Boom!\" guys.\n\nBut I mean, basically everyone has gone from calling anyone pointing out the housing bubble chicken little to saying \"yeah man, everyone knew that\", so there are any number of idiots who can provide you with info on this, though I expect it'll take a few more months before the equity linkage comes up in the mainstream press.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Third, the Food Shortage\n\nThe first farm scout reports came in last week from the midwest, and they're pretty bad.  These aren't definitive numbers wise, but they're very good at identifying directionality.  Wheat, Corn, and Soybeans all came in about 4% under USDA estimates in the midwest breadbasket states.  (remember kids, this doesn't cover California, which is even more drought and heat stricken, and produces 25% of US food) Effectively this means US production can't offset the massive shortages occurring in Europe, China, South America, and India.  The situation in China is particularly brutal, they've had flooding, then went into the worst heat dome effect since the start of recorded meteorology - not a joke, 1876 is the last time things *might* have been this bad - back into what looks like a record monsoon season and more flooding.\n\nIf you want an idea of how seriously you should take the crop scout report, here's a snapshot of futures prices before and after it was released:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cm0oox95z1m91.jpg?width=1138&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b43bbea2505fe9cd64fe4a12dabd77ad1cbd2c1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzpgrp74z1m91.jpg?width=1146&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2dc55289c9e5efb0a7e20ae9f85e241d7dc7bc\n\nRemember, it's worse in Europe, China, South America, and India and they all have significantly less resources to deal with this than the USA does.  I'm guessing the USDA only slightly revises their September yield estimates downwards, so we'll still have another downside surprise in American production when the harvest actually begins this fall.  Meanwhile, most worldwide grain production estimates I've been tracking are consistently underestimating the amount of production and distribution lost from the Ukraine war and the extreme weather from the third year of La Nina, while significantly overestimating the ability of countries like the US and Canada to make up the difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Fourth, the Energy Shortage\n\nHere's a fun one.  [This is the first DD I ever wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) for WSB.  Made myself and others a very nice chunk of change on it.  It's from around 18 months ago.  You'll notice that everything I pointed out in there about lack of CAPEX in the energy sector and incompetent, belligerent relations between East and West and how that would impact energy prices has played out basically EXACTLY as I predicted, except even more to the downside because the guys who failed out of clown college are now running the circus.\n\nI don't actually have any positions on the mess that is the global energy supply system right now, outside of a small one in Uranium (shares only) based on the theoretical hope that sanity at some point prevails.  Power use is going to drop as the summer heatwaves subside into autumn's cooler weather.  Everything with energy is just too priced in right now, except the possibility that this winter will be warmer than average.  I think we do get OPEC output cuts this fall, that will probably match up with the end of the US SPR withdrawals (remember, that's got to be built back up eventually), and I'll be looking to get in on energy around October or November, but for right now I'm not touching it.  YMMV.\n\nThe \"price cap\" idea we're seeing from G7 leaders is just a bad sketch comedy segment.  You can have price caps, or you can have supply.  You only get one, not both.  I mean, you see copium and hopium on these subs all the time (maybe my China investments will be profitable?) and other such nonsense, but the stuff the big boys pull is flat out ridic.  And to think, Putin got all of this with a small $1 million/year bribe to Gerhard Schroeder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Fifth, the next crisis, Political Unrest and Mass Migration\n\nI said in [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/) a couple of months ago about how we'd see an increase in protests, riots and political unrest as a result of increasing energy and food prices, and those would be blamed on racial or social issues rather than the true causes of said unrest - inflation, wealth concentration, and shortages.  The recent mass protests in the Czech Republic, in Paris, and whatever the hell the president's \"red speech of doom\" last week was are all examples of this.  (speaking of instability, it's worth mentioning that roughly 1/3 of Pakistan is currently underwater, but its fine, that's a very stable country with good relations with its neighbors, no corruption, no relationships with terrorist organizations, and no nuclear weapons)\n\nLook, remember the last time we had a big spike in food prices and some Tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire starting the Arab Spring, and how like, half of Syria and the middle east walked to Europe and that just kinda fucked everything up?  Like every mass migration of people throughout the entirety of human history has?\n\nCivilization runs on Food, Energy, and Stability.  Take the first two away and the third goes right out the window.  Things are going to get bad in the first world and flat out apocalyptic in the third.  The only thing keeping Sri Lankans on Sri Lanka right now is the ocean.  Lots of places that don't have that barrier are going to see folks walking off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sixth, My Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/podpr14hw2m91.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef367a0add85a408dbf25110f9e2a87ccccc702f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esqydezhw2m91.png?width=1518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a3c69b3184b863bb6f9c9496575cc32629443c8\n\nI'll be adding a lot more once the rest of the money I have en route to my brokerages settles.  I also have a small shares only position in Uranium, some BBBY (I was buying shares and calls back at $4.30, and I sold some on the way up, and no, I don't think the stock with the 102% official short interest is done with volatility) and a rather silly amount of drs'd GME, including some $320/share bags that have made me incredibly strong over the last year+.\n\nFinally, because I always, always, always get asked about this, how do I find this stuff or research plays or figure out what to invest in?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t43o4u0ex2m91.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eec8d4568ef11243fb886ae997afcd8c440f4dd5\n\nThat's it.  That's how you do it.  You fucking look and do the research.  Good luck out there people.  Here it is, the sum of the last two years of my research and plays.  I'll keep providing updates on how this goes, profits or losses.",

What's more is, after spending a year and half on R&amp;D, they figured out a way to also shut down the sell button.\n\nWhen questioned on the high risk move, Robinhood's recently hired Chief Moasis Officer (CMO), Vladimir Tentative, mumbled something about \"being in labor\" and then galloped away.

    "title": "Horse Blanket Money - Make your BBBY losses back in 5 easy payments of $99.95",
    "selftext": "I post once a week with some solid advice from spending time around really rich people.  And the thing they are all talking about right now is the Chinese IPOs and IPOs in general.  Which makes sense because while the majority of this sub is giving back all their GME gains to the hedge funds via BBBY transfers, rich fucks are raking in money on IPO pumps.  Your boy RC pumped his BBBY bags and rugged everyone so why shouldn't you enjoy that same level of pleasure?!?  Probably because you're too stupid and not a billionaire.  But just incase you have a couple wrinkles in your brain and more than 2 pennies to rub together let me to continue introducing you to the wonderful world of IPOs.  I'm sure there is another sub this belongs on but this one is way more fun and I honestly like the majority of the folks I've met on here.  \n\nLet me make this real simple.  See this horse?  Scroll down.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctn2d0j0iam91.jpg?width=1276&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dcd1a4e2b297b7df2b41c65366eea9eeaabd8cf\n\nSee this horse? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inwjvnl3iam91.jpg?width=524&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=969a171cdfd0c88a9f629625c09f50651f6f3c60\n\nThis is what I call horse blanket money. First off I want to state the obvious, these horses fuck. Lots of people own horses.  But if you're driving by someone's field and you see a horse roaming around with their own damn fashionable blanket that is the fastest way to detect wealth.  How did these people get horse blankets?  With horse blanket money.  How do they get horse blanket money?  By probably making 50% or more every damn time on their IPO investment more reliably than Tim Donaghy picking a basketball game (watch the netflix special if you haven't already).  Why is that?  Because FOMO is more powerful than any of the other psychological shit that goes into investing.  Almost every single IPO in the history of time has gone up before it went down.  Don't get greedy, take your 10% or more and move on.  The Chinese ones are extra special lately and I have no idea why, but until the government shuts down whatever fuckery they are pulling that is going to continue.  It has got me significant money for my poor ass this year so far.  And no I'm not talking about getting into these pre-live date.  I am talking about after they post on the brokerages to the public, you don't have to be any sort of special to pull this off.  \n\nThis week we have **K N W N** going live on the Nasdaq which is somewhat unique because it isn't a full fledged IPO it is just an OTC getting upgraded to the big boy league, which makes sense because they make some pretty cool tech for Diabetics (basically everyone that lives in America) to monitor glucose levels without breaking the skin.  It is already up 68% at one point today, hasn't gone live on the Nasdaq yet.  \n\nThen we have **W L D S** which is also some cool wearable AI VR tech out of Israel, and if you followed my previous posts the last company out of Israel went 100% (took profit) and then tanked.  \n\nDON'T GET GREEDY.  Also make sure to watch Rounders and pay attention to Joey Knisch as I stated previously if you haven't already.  Great lessons there modeled after a live person.  \n\nSide note I feel like we live in a simulation.  With my winnings so far I got my driveway paved, I then drove a rubber tracked 18k lbs excavator on it and tore it all to hell even though the asphalt guy promised I could after X amount of time.  But then the 60k+ lbs concrete truck with way smaller contact patch size went across the same asphalt same day no problem.  The next day I saw the same black cat cross the driveway twice.  Glitch in the matrix if you ask me.  \n\nAnyways.  Horse blanket money, get u some.",

People bitch that the culture of this sub has been changed by Meme Stocks while unironically telling people ETFs to trade, how to diversify their portfolio, and how to calculate risk. Sure, there was a bit of that in the old old days from a few key members who were this sub's sages, but it was mostly people making wild bets, and them not paying off, then commiserating in the comments together about it.\n\nSo, if you're shitting on people for making bad bets rather than joking *with them*, and you've also not placed any bets like a sidelining pussy, then you're just as much a catalyst for the culture change in this sub as anyone else you'd otherwise blame.\n\nPositions: AMZN, RIVN, Trulieve, SQQQ, CRSR, BBBY, GME and a few others this sub would recognize from the old days that are now below market cap.",

    "selftext": "I know y'all are looking for the next big thing after striking gold with GME. I was right there alongside y'all as it made its historic climb, and I sold when I was satisfied with my profits. If that makes me a paperhanded sellout, I don't care. I made money, end of story. If y'all think that is somehow a bad thing, then y'all are delusional. The ultimate goal of every trade you make should be to make money, not to stick it to your idea of the 'bad guys.' With that out of the way, just because WSB was involved with the biggest short squeeze since Volkswagen doesn't mean that somehow **any** ticker that people decide to pile on here will be a success. There are a number of differences between GME and BBBY that should make anyone with half a smooth brain think twice.  \n\n1. **GME was not facing bankruptcy risk.**   \nJust because everyone thought GME's business model was defunct (before y'all piled on) doesn't mean it actually was. They had decent liquidity, they were able to lease-back their warehouses, and they still had the new console cycle to potentially rev up sales again. They also had working capital that was larger than their debt by a long-shot. Despite this, GME was shorted like crazy and at many points, the short interest exceeded 100%. That was why I got into the shares in 2020, and why I would afford to wait as long as it took until the short squeeze happened. They could remain in business longer than the shorts could stay solvent. Ryan Cohen was simply the spark that ignited the fire.   \nBBBY, on the other hand, has an exceedingly large debt pile and little way of paying it off organically. The fact that they decide to sell shares recently close to the bottom shows this. That means that even if BBBY does last a few more years, it'll come at the expense of shareholders. They're literally paperhanding while y'all are stuck with the bags. How did they get in this situation, with so much debt? That leads me to my next point. \n2. **GME was excellent at buybacks, whereas BBBY has been horrible at it.**   \nGME bought back a large % of the float, at least 30%, with its buybacks over the late 2010's. They had a large windfall after selling the Mobile phone division, and pretty much used all of it to buyback shares when they were in the $5 range (pre-split), which would be under $2 now. This definitely played a part in trapping the shorts, tipping the short interest over 100% eventually. It was only after the squeeze took off that GME sold shares in the $200 range, further securing capital so that they had the ability to pivot and find other growth venues (Whether they have succeeded here is another story). But the point being, they were able to secure enough runway to anchor the stock to a higher price point, which is why GME is doing decently well even to this day.   \nBBBY, however, decided to squander all their capital in the 2010's on buybacks when the stock price in the $40 and $50 range! The worst part was they took on debt to do this, essentially gambling away the future of the company on the hopes that BBBY sales would never falter.  BBBY was worth over 9 Billion dollars, and they took over 1.5 billion in debt in 2015 to buyback a   \nmere fraction of the shares. And now the business is worth barely third they spent that year on buybacks. This is all fine if the business itself was fine, which brings me to my last point.   \n\n3.  **BBBY's business has no moat or niche, other than heavy discounting with coupons.**   \nGME, while it is far from its prime, still has a niche. No one is going to get into video game re-selling or physical devices. They did try to pivot to merchandise like POPs and collectibles, which helped a bit as well. They still faced heavy competition from a bunch of stores, but at least they had a specialty. What is BBBY's specialty? Beds? Baths? The Beyond in their name even shows they sell too many random things. Why would someone go to BBBY when they could go to Target or Walmart or Costco? GME has the benefit of selection and variety, but BBBY has very few things people need to go there for. And when they do go there, they usually only do so to use the 20% coupons, which destroys margins. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anyway**, I know this is WSB, not some fundamental analysis board. But since everyone who's diamond handing is essentially a buy-and-hold investor (whether you like it or not), remember, if the business goes under, it will be a loss whether you sell or not. If y'all are willing to hold on forever, then it's not even a trade, since a trade needs to have an exit point, and I just can't see what could happen outside of a miracle that could give y'all that. (especially if you decided to buy at the peak over $25 a few weeks ago) I'm all up for outsized bets, but my god, it's more fun if it's not just diving straight off a cliff. At least aim for something that has a **chance** of striking big. Just because something is heavily shorted doesn't mean it's bound to fly. And if there is something I'm missing, then I'd love to hear it. Best of luck y'all.   \n\n\nTLDR: BBBY sucks a lot more than GME and management will probably paperhand shares faster than y'all can stay solvent.",

Is the plan to DRS the remainder over the next 8 years?\n\nRegarding the numbers.  Revenue down means a business is shrinking; not only that GME went into this quarter with almost double the normal level of inventory, so sales should have crushed the prior year's numbers.  Expenses down to me means employees are simply leaving.  The stock compensation plan to me seems to be a way of conserving cash.  I doubt employees really car about stock; I know they'd rather have cash.   Most importantly, GME shows no sign of becoming profitable.\n\nThe plan to turn around the company is based on NFTs for gaming.  I don't see how games are going to be introduced on this platform versus competitors with far more resources.  Its a pipe dream\n\nSure the company has cash of $900 million, but it is valued at $7.3 billion.   Where does someone come to the conclusion that the balance of the company is worth $6.4 billion?\n\nI expected this quarters numbers to suck as they did, and expected expenses to be light just from reading about how unhappy the store level staff is but I'm honestly amazed people somehow are bullish?  This plan is also based on a coordinated team squeeze  seems like a delusional pipe dream to me.    Of all the stocks in the world to focus on, I just don't get the obsession with this company.\n\nI expect all sorts of shitty comments.  Go for it.\n\nPS.  I think Ryan Cohen is a complete douche",

In the other post I made I stated that GME is likely to jump because there is a correlation between earnings and large gains with Game Stop.  On top of that, here I also look at short interest, max pain and recent golden crosses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n:::::::::::EDIT::::::::::::::To all you naysayers.... People who think GME is Dead... I have to explain something.\n\nAnd this is above and beyond everything I write down there .... I want to be very clear about this.GME fluctuates (on average) 14% in ONE DAY, at least once a week (over the last year).  Every week, on average, there's a day where it moves 14 fucking percent or more!Over the last year, it has moved 8% in ONE day HALF the time.   When you wake up on ANY given trading day, there's a 94% chance GME will move at least 3%, a 50% chance it will move at least 8%, and a 36% chance it will move 10% or more.  And that's just your average run of the mill day.  Then there's days like what I'm talking about is likely to happen.  The three best days of the last year, GME moved 64%, 58% and 40%. Days like that happen every 4 months on average.  Do you understand how much money you can make when the stock jumps 50% in one day?

Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit. Isn\u2019t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown? Just like last time you can \u2018put rules in place to make sure this won\u2019t happen again\u2019\n\nIn 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn\u2019t bail them out, so the government did it.\n\nWe posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday. By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.\n\nAre we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008? Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?\n\nEdit because it got attention: if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share. They would have to pay it back over time. The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function, and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules.",

This could be the same thing.  Yeah, OK.  Then, I could see why people wanted to jump into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\n\nThen, when the stock fell lower following RC's investment.  Sure.  Hell, if Cohen and his masters of financial calculation saw value in this stock at a much higher price, it follows logically that others considered it a great buying opportunity to jump in at an even further discounted price.\n\nAnd when the short interest started to rise dramatically...Hey, I'm with you there.  Even when the stock roared higher during the squeeze, I can see people buying at $25 and $28, because, hey, who knows?  Maybe this thing roars into the hundreds like GME did, right?\n\nBut after it was perfectly clear that RC had bailed out of his position completely, and the squeeze had lost its momentum, and the CEO came out with her \"strategy\" for the future, and the CFO perished under tragic circumstances...What is the catalyst that people are believing will move this thing higher?  Is is just a bunch of bagholders hoping against hope that something will save them?\n\nI'm as much of a \"Give'm Hell!\", regarded ape as the next person.   I'm HODLing X,XXX shares of GameStop because this whole DRS movement still has legs (23% of all outstanding shares direct registered as of the end of July 2022).   I want to see more evil short hedge funds collapse like Melvin Capital.  I consider Kenneth C. Griffin to be the antichrist.   So, I consider myself a tinfoil-hat-wearing, conspiracy-buying, nut-job.  But I just don't understand why people think that BBBY is the way.  I don't get it.   What's left in that stock that will make it rise higher?\n\nI would appreciate any propaganda that anyone would like to share that in any way, shape or form even vaguely resembles due diligence on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.   Help me understand what I'm missing.\n\nThanks to all in advance.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! hope you are doing well.  I just wanted to share some charts I colored on to show you that GME is going to have some gains this week and I'm hoping that maybe some of you degenerates can make some tendies.  None of this is financial advice, I'm very regarded and eat crayons.  GME is about to have a positive crossover on the 1 day MACD, everytime GME has had a crossover there has been a significant increase in price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0fbt4ywnhn91.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4786692e4bce816e6b5f8713871fa6a9869a00)\n\nThe main take away from this is highlighted by the purple circle.  Looks like there is a golden cross headed to a positive cross over on the 1 day MACD. The last cross over was on 8/3 and the stonk went from 36 -&gt; 48. Another one on 7/11 when it went 31 -&gt;40. This cross over that's about to happen looks very similiar to the one on 5/24 when it went 21 -&gt;37.  Positive crossover's on the 1 day MACD for GME has been a reliable indicator for me to tell when gme is about to go up. This positive momentum is confirmed by the other indicators I use.\n\nParabolicsar ( yellow arrow) - flipped to postive = this is bullish\n\nStochastics (orange arrow) - has had a golden cross, is going up and diverging = also bullish\n\nAccumulation/ distribution (pink arrow) - is going up\n\nAroon (Blue) - is also going up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall - GME has been in a down trend since 8/16, is currently oversold and is about to have a positive cross over on the 1 day MACD. This means stonk goes up and is confirmed by other indicators being super bullish. I'd like to zoom out to show you the stonk on a macro level\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 week chart](https://preview.redd.it/ccgsw7u1ohn91.png?width=1023&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0431f2a1e730c280abcaf966b621c9c3560a8e3)\n\nThe main take away is highlighted by the purple circle.  There is about to be a golden cross on stochastics.  This tells me that GME likely has found a bottom and will be going up. The last chart I color on for you is the 4 hour chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 4 hour chart](https://preview.redd.it/1cr7b2e4ohn91.png?width=1037&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=106df95168681dcbd41b71cece3f90974d0d7b34)\n\nThis is showing what GME is headed into for tomorrow.  Highlighted by the purple circle, GME is at a critical resistance right now at 30 with the another diagonal resistance around 28.  With the set up right now, I speculate that resistance won't hold long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz726crbohn91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e7876c3171a06e71b933625527052fa3ea99587\n\nTLDR: GME is about to have a positive crossover on the 1 day MACD.  This means GME is about to go up\n\nTARD: Stonk go up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nupdate 9/13\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 day](https://preview.redd.it/aupbyehmfon91.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9b4461357a886c54902aa30d6c19862464ca989)\n\nThe crossover hasn't happened yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnd of week update: 9/16\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/m4wo1kjdiao91.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c629990806611366105d8766709441cfe19c81a7)\n\nThe MACD crossover happened. Next week, I think GME is going to break the diagonal resistance at around 28.  I also think gme will break 30, and test the 32 resitance.  If that breaks it could get super interesting because gme is the most violatile stock there is and I love that shit.\n\nMACD (purple circle) - Golden cross, confirmed green historgram.  if the moving averages go into positive territory, shit's going to get interesting\n\nStoch (pink arrow) - Golden cress, trending up, with plenty of room to go up\n\nA/D (Blue Arrow) - Is trending up\n\nAroon (Orange) - is going up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall - I think that all you degens that bought weeklies next week are going to be bricked up when your shit hits.  I think 32 is a tough resistance, if/when it passes 35 + is plausible\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the 1 week chart](https://preview.redd.it/6ooyjwfikao91.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6d32cb09452871ff7da3720dc8726e8d796e9b7)\n\nThe key takeway here is stochastics (purple circle) , with the 1 day looking so bullish and it looks like it hit a bottom. GME is about to go up again.\n\nMACD (green arrow) - Should flip positive confirming that gme has hit a bottom.\n\nOverall - I think there will be a decent sized green candle next week for GME on the 1 week chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers! If anyone actually reads these updates, I hope you have a great weekend.  See you when the casino opens",

    "selftext": "**TL/DR** *I like the stock !* \ud83d\ude80\n \nAllright listen up retards, and listen well. I'm an OG and I have some hard to swallow truth for you. This sub has been overtaken by nefarious actors, bots and actual retards since the GME drama. Squeeze this. Squeeze that. Squeeze my fucking dick and fuck betting on lame has-been retail companies and fucking silver. \n \nIt's time we reclaim this sub and start posting proper autistic bets and DD again.\n \nNow, for those of you cowboys with at least a braincell remaining, boys do I got a bet for you. Something asymetrical and long term. *ewww, long term*, I hear you say? Well, perhaps I can change your mind about that!\n \nAs many here may already know, AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is a pre-revenue company aiming to deliver world-wide satellite-based direct-to-cellphone broadband. That means 2G/3G/4G/5G all over the world, from space, on the device in your hands right now. No more dead spots.\n \nI could talk for hours of the benefits and desirability of this service, the adressable market of billions, their partnerships and MOUs for distribution through cell-phone service providers, their 2400 patents, their amazing CEO and how he personally funded ASTS' beginnings, the marvels of technology they have built, how stupidly faster than GSAT IRDM AAPL and starlink it will be, how they launched yesterday their first satellite and are about to demonstrate their tech in the coming weeks, etc., but I'm going to take you by the sentiments. *Let's talk money*.\n \nASTS plans to deploy 168 sats. Sats will cost somewhere around 16M and launches 5M. Each sat will be able to give 1.8M GB per month. \n \n*Yes, but how much is a GB of space internet worth?* I hear you ask?\n \nWell I kid you not, Globalstar and Iridium are managing to sell their GB for more than *2000$* a pop. That's fucking right. And they're slow af, not even comparable.\n \nNow, for the sake of pessimism (\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.\n \nOnce the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**\n\nYeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.\n \nIf we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. \n \nThat means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.\n \nSo here's the bet. **&gt;**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\n \nPosition: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.\n \nDisclosure: Forward looking statements, Not financial advice, Do your own DD, don't trust strangers on the internet, Gambling is risky, yaddi yaddi yadda.\n \nNote: For those curious to learn more check out r/ASTSpacemobile",

    "selftext": "I am making this post to let everyone know my thoughts regarding the way that GME, AMC, and BBBY are positioned for tomorrow headed into Quad witching day. \n\n- Review of the Day\n\nCompared to the broad market, all three stocks did very well. Individually, on the [daily chart](https://imgur.com/a/cRiMExm), GME is remaining immediately below it's volume shelf, AMC is actually just above it's volume shelf, and BBBY is struggling the most with multiple immediate deep volume shelves above it. \n\nWhat this means is that AMC is positioned the best (on the daily time frame), GME is positioned very well (especially considering the impressive manner with which it closed the day;  see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/0jCI)),\nand BBBY is not far behind (considering it's rally into the close, as well; see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/Xle2Xoa)). \n\nOutside of this, as of yesterday, the skew for all of these tickers was indicating that they would likely face bearish sentiment (more positive value actually indicates more bearish sentiment). However, as of today, they are all [skewed](https://imgur.com/a/pWIgmS0)in favor of bullish sentiment. \n\nFor those of you scratching your heads saying \"what does skew mean?\" It is a measure of the total implied volatility to both the upside and to the downside. So, if the total implied volatility tells you that a stock is likely to move wildly in a general direction, the skew tells you which direction that wild swing is likely to move toward. \n\n- What does all of this mean!? \n\nUltimately, I suspect that the broad market is likely to remain flat or even perhaps rally tomorrow given that it is Quad witching day, the [SPY](https://imgur.com/a/devHb64) rallied into the close, and that the price action naturally gravitates toward the point of control (POC; red line flowing from the strongest volume shelf). I suspect that this will serve to propel our beloved Meme Stocks toward Valhalla... All we have to do is break away from our own volume shelves, and then, they are gone! \ud83e\udd1e \ud83e\udd37\n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions. I'm happy to help. I am learning alongside you and so, I appreciate you making me think critically. I welcome negative criticism. :)\n\nTl;Dr - Tomorrow's OPEX looks great for our Meme Stocks. The broad market is likely to remain flat or rally tomorrow, thereby helping our movement.\n\nEdit: I am listing the Max Pain values for each stock to know which value market makers are likely to fall toward (independent of any of my work).\n\nGME - $30\nAMC - $11\nBBBY - $10",

    "title": "For all of those GME, AMC, and BBBY Bagholders...",
    "selftext": "This post provides an overview analysis of where GME, AMC, and BBBY have been recently, and where they are currently in order to understand what likely will happen within the next few days...\n\n- What has already happened?\n\nOn Sept. 7th, we completed a steep downtrend (all of the red on the [daily chart](https://imgur.com/a/ZvIxlFl), https://imgur.com/a/xqFUYAA, https://imgur.com/a/GnzrQxC) by finishing the day with a hammer candle on both GME and AMC. For BBBY, the top wick was a bit longer (and this actually happened a day earlier on Sept. 6th), but the end result was the same, and that is that we started preparing for upside potential. \n\nFor those of you unaware, hammer candles imply that buyers have started to gain control and are, ultimately, pushing the stock back up. This marked the transition into a markup phase (if everything that I am interpreting is correct, anyway...). This is important bc I believe that all of the selling that we were experiencing was the development of a spring. Now, what happens when you push on a spring? It explodes upward!!! Exciting, isn't it!?\n\nThe development of the spring pushed us out of the trading range (marked by the two horizontal white lines; \n\nGME : Bottom = $28.70; top = $47.75\nAMC : Bottom (of Reaccumulation) = $8.77; top = $17.80\nBBBY : Bottom (of Reaccumulation) = $8.76; top = $29.76\n\nThis was immediately met with considerable volume (volume profile at the bottom of the screenshots), although admittedly, this is less true for BBBY, thereby pushing us back into the trading range. \n\nImmediately following our spring back into the range, we tested our spring development and, once again, went below the trading range in GME and BBBY (interestingly enough though, not in AMC). The thing that is important about this test is that we went below the range (meaning that the price decreased) on low volume (compare with volume that pushed us into the trading range). The reason this is important is bc trading volume is analogous to voting power; the more votes you have, the more likely you are to be elected (... I stole this analogy from Trey, actually. Thanks Trey!!!). Therefore, if the price is decreasing on lower volume, it is unlikely to hold. This is exactly what has happened today; we shot right back up and finished the day with a hammer candle on super low volume ON ALL THREE TICKERS!!! What's better, is that we closed the day above the \"point of control\" (POC) on the [hourly chart](https://imgur.com/a/IngZ2Fo, https://imgur.com/a/W3ApGgR) for GME and AMC. Unfortunately, this is not yet true for BBBY, but I think it's coming soon!!! (this is the red horizontal line that extends from the volume profile on the right side of the screenshot). \n\nThe POC is a price area for which a considerable number of trades have taken place. This indicates that buyers and sellers have agreed that this is an established trading area, and is therefore acting as strong support (or resistance). Now that we are above it, it will act to keep our price above this level. I have indicated that there is less price action to navigate as we continue to move upward (see the smaller volume shelves on the right side of the screen on both the hourly and daily charts). On both the hourly and daily chart, we can see that as price increases, our likelihood for continued price improvement also increases (this is true bc as the volume shelves become smaller, the price will continue to move away from it). \n\n- What can we look forward to in the near future? \n\nThe short answer is, up (that is, assuming that we move back into the trading range for GME and BBBY). \n\nFollowing the spring and test event (known as [Phase C](https://imgur.com/a/RkgWRTN)), we move into a period of strong price improvement. However, I want to mention that while the price is improving, so long as it remains within the trading range \n\nGME : between $28.70 - $47.75 on the daily chart\nAMC : between $8.77 - $17.80 on the daily chart\nBBBY : between $8.76 -$29.76 on the daily chart\n\nit has not yet \"broken out.\" Therefore, it important to ONLY PLAY THE RANGE if you are playing options and to be careful in how much time you have before contract expiration!!!\n\nIf, and this is a BIG if, we leave the trading range within the next few days, be very careful. We will be in otherwise, uncharted territory. Everyone should know that \"false breakouts\" do and likely WILL happen. The only way to be certain that we have moved from a \"Phase D - Jump Across the Creek\" event and into a \"Phase E - Breakout\" event is with the test event known as the \"Back up to the edge of the Creek.\" This test is similar in nature to the one that we just completed in that if it goes down and then immediately springs back up for continued movement up (specifically on lower relative volume). If this happens, then you can be sure that we have successfully entered the \"Phase E - Breakout\" event. \n\nIf you are ever trying to discern what levels to play or how much we will move, look at the volume profiles and use fib levels. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I am excited to be learning about all of this and to be able to help everyone else learn alongside me. \n\nTl;Dr - We were going down, now we will likely be going back up... A lot. Be careful and play the levels.\n\nEdit: I am including the implied volatility charts for [GME](https://imgur.com/a/t1LxVkY), [AMC](https://imgur.com/a/WbksE2q), and [BBBY](https://imgur.com/a/r2bNQIK) \n\nFor those of you unaware, the IV charts will give you a (rough) idea of how expensive call options are at any given point. I am sharing this bc everytime that the IV chart falls down to touch that red line, price runs up. However, word of caution to everyone... This is STRICTLY CORRELATION, NOT CAUSATION. There IS!!! a difference. \n\nEdit #2: I am making a point in anticipation that each of these stocks will likely fall (very) quickly at market open bc shorts have piled in this morning. \n\nI believe it is likely that:\nGME - will fall somewhere near $27.20(ish)\nAMC - will fall somewhere to $9.20(ish)\nBBBY - will fall somewhere near $8.00(ish)\n\nDO NOT PILE IN AT MARKET OPEN!!! It is a much better plan to wait for day traders and take a planned trade. Trade smart and careful. \n\nGood luck everyone!!! :)",

    "selftext": "Tesla is now in second place for total sh0rt 1nteres1 (mods \ud83e\udd71)I like this stock.\n\nIt is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I\u2019m thinking about a few things:\n\nPresidential cycles: \n\n(formatted weird due to some rules)\n\nFor like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.\n\nTesla\u2019s trend:\n\nAbsolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I\u2019m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.\n\nNOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:\n\nIt really isn\u2019t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon\u2019s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it\u2019s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don\u2019t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I\u2019d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYou gotta love him. He\u2019s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he\u2019s an absolute savage. I\u2019m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he\u2019s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.\n\nTLDR: Why the fuck haven\u2019t we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don\u2019t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife\u2019s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years?

    "title": "Nokia (NOK) chosen as the next best stock to go \u201cMEME\u201d in the market",
    "selftext": "While meme stocks are often associated with risky investments, there are a few with strong fundamentals that investors might want to buy to cash in on the craze.\n\nNokia (NOK): Nokia has transformed dramatically, re-emerging as a major player in the telecom industry.\n\nWhen looking for the best meme stocks to buy, it is important to shield yourself against volatility. The best way to do so is through investing in meme stocks with strong fundamentals. For example, you want to look for stocks with a history of growing earnings, a strong balance sheet and a proven business model. Additionally, consider buying stocks that trade at low valuations to protect yourself against this inherent volatility.\n\nFor many investors, meme stocks and solid fundamentals do not go hand in hand. Companies such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) are best known for being volatile, and investors often feel they can\u2019t be relied on to provide stability.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that any particular meme stock will be successful, investors should carefully research any stock before buying it. Not only do these three companies have strong business models, but they are also operating in high-growth industries. This fundamental strength gives them a distinct advantage over other companies that do not have such a safety net.\n\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) was once the undisputed king of the mobile phone market. However, its dominance began to unravel in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone. It was slow to embrace touch screens and failed to capitalize on the popularity of app stores. As a result, its once-loyal customer base began to desert Nokia in droves. \n\nThe company desperately attempted to regain market share by adopting Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system, but it was too late. By 2013, Nokia\u2019s phones were no longer selling in significant numbers, and the company was forced to sell its handset business to Microsoft.\n\nHowever, Nokia has been focusing on 5G for the last five years, and it looks to be in a prime position to continue succeeding in this new area. \n\nThe company has been investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) for 5G technology, and its products have been well-received by customers. Nokia is also one of the few companies with a complete end-to-end 5G solution, which gives it a significant advantage over its competitors.\n\nNokia has stitched together seven consecutive earning beats, demonstrating the company\u2019s superior fundamentals. It is also a well-rounded company with a diversified product portfolio and a strong presence in emerging and developed markets.\n\nFurthermore, Nokia has a strong balance sheet with plenty of dry powder to invest in growth initiatives. In sum, Nokia is a high-quality company with a bright future, which is why Nokia is among the best meme stocks to buy.",

    "title": "AMC DD",
    "selftext": "Recently, I have made a few posts regarding the Meme Stocks and their likelihood for price improvement within the foreseeable future... I still believe this is true. However, I do need to mention for anyone getting terribly excited right now, the outlook for AMC (which is what this post will focus on) is much less good than for GME, so be cautious).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe purpose of this post is to specifically provide data on AMC (for those of you interested, I have already made a post for GME; you can find the link \\[here\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xh6725/doin\\_some\\_diggin/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xh6725/doin_some_diggin/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), and intend to write up the same thing for BBBY. I should have this out no later than this evening, for anyone waiting). The data that this post will focus on most heavily is that of GEX and skew-adjusted GEX data. (For those of you unfamiliar with this information, or any other data that I make reference to, I will do my best to explain as we go).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- Chart Data\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we get too deep into this dense topic, I want to mention AMC's current position, according to the daily and 2-hour chart. It remains within a \\\\\\[consolidation pattern\\\\\\](\\[[https://imgur.com/a/mYmBFZA](https://imgur.com/a/mYmBFZA)) which is good because the consolidation pattern is strengthened by its decrease in daily volume; that is, until Friday for which it increased in volume and decreased in price. Despite this bad news, there are still a few positives to focus on, including the support line that continues to hold us up on these time frames, as well as the bollinger band compression that has been developing (I understand that the compression is relaxing following our sell-off on Friday, but stay positive!!!) as the stock remains within its consolidation pattern, indicating that it will likely experience an upcoming breakout. Further, AMC had a decent push back upward in the after-hours indicating that the fight isn't over yet!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- What is Naive GEX/Skew-adjusted GEX?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNaive GEX stands for \"Naive Gamma Exposure\" and is a measurement of the market makers hedging and un-hedging. \"Naive GEX\" calculations assume that investors are primarily selling calls and buying puts (Market Markers buy the calls and sell the puts, then hedge their positive delta by shorting shares).The accuracy of Naive GEX on a given security depends on the validity of the base GEX assumptions, specifically whether investors are selling calls and buying puts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTypically (in less manipulated or controlled stocks), it is safe to assume that market makers buy calls and write puts; however, for the \"meme\" stocks, this is likely less true. If you are interested in learning more, I am attaching another link describing this information \\\\\\[here\\\\\\](\\[[https://www.financetldr.com/posts/research-predict-the-market-with-the-dark-index-and-gamma](https://www.financetldr.com/posts/research-predict-the-market-with-the-dark-index-and-gamma)\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first article also describes the \"Dark Pool Index.\" I argue that this is a good thing for everyone to read about considering it describes how, and for what purpose, market makers use dark pools during the hedging process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- So, how do we get around this problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe use the \"Skew-adjusted GEX\" which adjusts the data to fit and describe the data more effectively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA stock's Call Skew influences the \"Skew-adjusted GEX,\" which changes to reflect estimated MM exposure. A positive Call Skew is common in stocks which have outsized speculative call buying. I have discussed this with respect to the meme stocks in a recent post, but suffice it to say that AMC's \\\\\\[call skew is holding up\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/yxKuSmi](https://imgur.com/a/yxKuSmi))indicating that the activity remains bullish. Further, compared to its average call skew, AMC has increased by almost \\\\\\[1%\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/cALvhTn](https://imgur.com/a/cALvhTn)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\\\* Positive Skew Adjusted GEX: Daily movement subdued as Market Makers re-hedge by buying as stock price falls, and adding to their short as stock price rises.\\\\\\* Negative Skew Adjusted GEX: Daily movement accentuated as Market Makers re-hedge by buying as stock price rises, and adding to their short as stock price falls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is important that you understand that Naive GEX values are (generally) positive when skew-adjusted GEX values are negative...otherwise, the upcoming data will get very confusing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote - For the upcoming information, I want to reference you toward two legends describing how to interpret much of the information that I will be discussing \\\\\\[here\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/d0QLjDV](https://imgur.com/a/d0QLjDV)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\\\- Back to the Action!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs is evident in AMC's recent \\\\\\[IV chart\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/qrqiFTZ](https://imgur.com/a/qrqiFTZ)), despite an increase in IV (relative to where we were at before the run-up in August) , the price has remained flat, thereby lending credibility to the note in the legend that I referenced you toward a moment ago. For those of you that did not look at the legend, I am referencing the tendency for a stock that experiences an increase in IV but does not increase in price is often a prelude to to an underlying price movement, meaning that it is reasonable that this stock will experience a push upwards in the near future (I have discussed more about this in my previous posts regarding spring development and Wyckoff analysis).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for AMC's Naive GEX, it is starting to \\\\\\[increase again\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/hE8c6wE](https://imgur.com/a/hE8c6wE)). Remember my earlier point that you need to remember regarding positive GEX values and negative skew-adjusted values? I hope so, bc \\\\\\[this\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/0199mji](https://imgur.com/a/0199mji)) screenshot represents the total gamma for AMC across all expirations (for the next 94 days anyway...) meaning that more positive values (i.e. bars on top) than negative values (bars on bottom) is indicative of an underlying potential gamma-squeeze. This is in contrast to the next few screenshots which show the \\\\\\[skew-adjusted gamma\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/972Id1B](https://imgur.com/a/972Id1B)) for all expirations (for the next 94 days), for this next week (Sept 23rd), and for Oct 21st. The fact that we have so much negative net skew-adjusted gamma is a good thing, especially because so many of these strike prices are immediately next to one another, which could serve to facilitate a gamma squeeze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I should note that not all of the positions for which we have higher gamma and more negative skew-adjusted gamma are immediately adjacent to one another. This is important because if we lose momentum in between these strike prices, it can certainly make for a difficult, and very frustrating experience. Critically, AMC is (very) close to its \"GEX Flip\" price. If we get pushed down to the area of $8.70(ish), the skew-adjusted value will flip from negative to positive, meaning that the market makers will move from buying stock as the price moves up to a position in which they buy on the way down and short on the way up, which would make our efforts more difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, given that we are so remarkably close to the \"GEX Flip' price, and that there is so much net positive skew-adjusted gamma below this price, it is very possible that AMC will be gamma ramped in the downward direction if we cannot hold this line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a more positive note, AMC's current \\\\\\[open interest\\\\\\]([https://imgur.com/a/DuaZ1cA](https://imgur.com/a/DuaZ1cA)) indicates that if we make it above $10, our current call activity far exceeds that of puts which will serve to facilitate wild price improvement...we just have to make it there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, the two big things holding us back for these last few days include this volume shelf at $10.00(ish) and the fact that we are so close to the \"GEX Flip\" price. If we manage to breach above and remain above, we stand a reasonable chance of retesting $11.00 and potentially moving higher. If we test above $11 and manage to hold above for at least 15 minutes (I say 15 minutes because I anticipate that for the algos to kick in with any reasonable strength that this is the time necessary to initiate this feedback loop of buying activity), I expect that things will get very good, very quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: GEX and Skew-adjusted GEX are measurements of market maker hedging and un-hedging. After reviewing this information for AMC, it seems clear that we are in a \"do or die\" situation such that we will either gamma ramp or gamma ramp down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions; I am always happy to help. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I have just noticed that the market makers have started adding new expirations for the month of October (the only expiration before Friday was Oct 21st).",

    "title": "Doin' some Diggin'...",
    "selftext": "Recently, I have made a few posts regarding the Meme Stocks and their likelihood for price improvement within the foreseeable future... I still believe this is true.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to specifically provide data on GameStop (don't worry, I'll be doing a similar post for AMC and BBBY when I finish reviewing their data). The data that this post will focus on most heavily is that of GEX and skew-adjusted GEX data. (For those of you unfamiliar with this information, or any other data that I make reference to, I will do my best to explain as we go).\n\n\\- Chart Data\n\nBefore we get too deep into such a dense topic, I want to mention GME's current position, according to the daily and 2-hour chart. It remains within a \\[consolidation pattern\\]([https://imgur.com/a/S9f7Fkl](https://imgur.com/a/S9f7Fkl)) which is good because the consolidation pattern is strengthened by its decrease in daily volume; that is, until Friday for which it increased in volume and continually attempted to breach above its volume shelf at $28.80(ish). Further, as you can see on the 2-hour chart, the Bollinger bands are compressing as the stock remains within its consolidation pattern, indicating that it will likely experience an upcoming breakout.\n\n\\- What is Naive GEX/Skew-adjusted GEX?\n\nNaive GEX stands for \"Naive Gamma Exposure\" and is a measurement of the market makers hedging and un-hedging. \"Naive GEX\" calculations assume that investors are primarily selling calls and buying puts (Market Markers buy the calls and sell the puts, then hedge their positive delta by shorting shares).The accuracy of Naive GEX on a given security depends on the validity of the base GEX assumptions, specifically whether investors are selling calls and buying puts.\n\nTypically (in less manipulated or controlled stocks), it is safe to assume that market makers buy calls and write puts; however, for the \"meme\" stocks, this is likely less true. \\[Here\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ftnj4j/help\\_me\\_understand\\_gex\\_gamma\\_exposure\\_and\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ftnj4j/help_me_understand_gex_gamma_exposure_and_the/)) is a link to a post that describes a bit more about this. If you are interested in learning more, I am attaching another link describing this information \\[here\\]([https://www.financetldr.com/posts/research-predict-the-market-with-the-dark-index-and-gamma](https://www.financetldr.com/posts/research-predict-the-market-with-the-dark-index-and-gamma)).\n\nThe first article also describes the \"Dark Pool Index.\" I argue that this is a good thing for everyone to read about considering it describes how, and for what purpose, market makers use dark pools during the hedging process.\n\n\\- So, how do we get around this problem?\n\nWe use the \"Skew-adjusted GEX\" which adjusts the data to fit and describe the data more effectively.\n\n\\[This\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/omdjeg/calculating\\_marketmakers\\_gex\\_gamma\\_exposure\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/omdjeg/calculating_marketmakers_gex_gamma_exposure_for/)) is a link to a post regarding the need for this \"Skew-adjusted GEX.\"\n\nA stock's Call Skew influences the \"Skew-adjusted GEX,\" which changes to reflect estimated MM exposure. A positive Call Skew is common in stocks which have outsized speculative call buying. I have discussed this with respect to the meme stocks in a recent post, but suffice it to say that GME's \\[call skew is going up\\]([https://imgur.com/a/qbatzTV](https://imgur.com/a/qbatzTV)) indicating that the activity is becoming increasingly bullish. Further, compared to its average call skew, GME has increased by almost \\[6%!!!\\]([https://imgur.com/a/tJLVtqx](https://imgur.com/a/tJLVtqx))\n\n\\* Positive Skew Adjusted GEX: Daily movement subdued as Market Makers re-hedge by buying as stock price falls, and adding to their short as stock price rises.\\* Negative Skew Adjusted GEX: Daily movement accentuated as Market Makers re-hedge by buying as stock price rises, and adding to their short as stock price falls.\n\nIt is important that you understand that Naive GEX values are (generally) positive when skew-adjusted GEX values are negative...otherwise, the upcoming data will get very confusing.\n\nNote - For the upcoming information, I want to reference you toward two legends describing how to interpret much of the information that I will be discussing \\[here\\]([https://imgur.com/a/ARUe7Ds](https://imgur.com/a/ARUe7Ds)) and \\[here\\]([https://imgur.com/a/5W52bts](https://imgur.com/a/5W52bts)).\n\n\\- Back to the Action!\n\nAs is evident in GME's recent \\[IV chart\\]([https://imgur.com/a/qPciSOM](https://imgur.com/a/qPciSOM)),  despite an increase in IV, the price has remained flat, thereby lending credibility to the note in the legend that I referenced you toward a moment ago. For those of you that did not look at the legend, I am referencing the tendency for a stock that experiences an increase in IV but does not increase in price is often a prelude to to an underlying price movement, meaning that it is likely that this stock will experience a push upwards in the near future (I have discussed more about this in my previous posts regarding spring development and Wyckoff analysis).\n\nAs for GME's Naive GEX, it is starting to \\[increase again\\]([https://imgur.com/a/AS4BDOe](https://imgur.com/a/AS4BDOe)). Remember my earlier point that you need to remember regarding positive GEX values and negative skew-adjusted values? I hope so, bc \\[this\\]([https://imgur.com/a/ovZ7RLN](https://imgur.com/a/ovZ7RLN)) screenshot represents the total gamma for GME across all expirations (for the next 94 days anyway...) meaning that more positive values (i.e. bars on top) than negative values (bars on bottom) is indicative of an underlying potential gamma-squeeze. This is in contrast to the next few screenshots which show the \\[skew-adjusted gamma\\]([https://imgur.com/a/KT5VOZR](https://imgur.com/a/KT5VOZR)) for all expirations (for the next 94 days), for this next week (Sept 23rd), and for Oct 21st. The fact that we have so much negative net skew-adjusted gamma is a good thing, especially because so many of these strike prices are immediately next to one another, which could serve to facilitate a gamma squeeze.\n\nHowever, I should note that not all of the positions for which we have higher gamma and more negative skew-adjusted gamma are immediately adjacent to one another. This is important because if we lose momentum in between these strike prices, it can certainly make for a difficult, and very frustrating experience. Further, if we get pushed down to the area of $25.68(ish), the skew-adjusted value will flip from negative to positive, meaning that the market makers will move from buying stock as the price moves up to a position in which they buy on the way down and short on the way up, which would make our efforts more difficult.\n\nThe good news is that several of these more negative skew-adjusted bars are at the volume shelves indicating that we have the majority of option control at these levels (at this moment, anyway...). Currently, GME's \\[open interest\\]([https://imgur.com/a/CIBkH0M](https://imgur.com/a/CIBkH0M)) indicates that if we make it above $30, our current call activity far exceeds that of puts which will serve to facilitate wild price improvement...we just have to make it there.\n\nUltimately, the same thing that has been holding us back for these last few days is the thing that is holding us back right now...this volume shelf at $28.80(ish). If we breach above and remain above for at least 15 minutes (I say 15 minutes because I anticipate that for the algos to kick in with any reasonable strength that this is the time necessary to initiate this feedback loop of buying activity), I expect that things will get very good, very quickly.\n\ntl;dr: GEX and Skew-adjusted GEX are measurements of market maker hedging and un-hedging. After reviewing this information for GME, it seems clear that market makers are in a very bad position and GME may likely experience an upcoming gamma squeeze.\n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions; I am always happy to help. :)\n\nEdit: I have just noticed that the market makers have started adding new expirations for the month of October (the only expiration before Friday was Oct 21st).\n\nEdit 2: I watched a [video](https://youtu.be/8sPX-TTDpIU) provided by u/ckkusa (thank you u/ckkusa) and it seems as though a few other people agree that GME is currently in a gamma squeeze... Food for thought everyone. :)",

    "selftext": "I'm sorry for you that you're gullible and have lost a huge chunk of your money in meme stocks you saw on reddit. What kind of a dick are you to then try to push your bags off on new people?\n\nI see posts like u/Ceyd77 's \"gme is at a discount\" and I'm like... MF'er, you don't have the first clue what it means for a stock to be trading at a discount. I've been meaning to 'show my work' on why GME is not likely to be a sensible buy at current share prices and I've finally gotten around to doing so. You can find that analysis here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME_Meltdown_DD/comments/xjsnxj/what_it_would_take_for_gme_to_be_a_good_buy_on/\n\nI'm open to legitimate critiques.\n\nThe TL;DR is that, when you talk about how GME Is unDERvAluEd tO IncREdibLE fuNdAMentAlS, what you really mean is that you believe that the net present value of the company's future cash flows is significantly greater than the current share price.\n\nI show several hypothetical futures for the company and what reasonable values per share might look like. For you to earn around a 7% compounding return on GME at the current share price, you need the company to start generating $100MM's in annual earnings (not revenue) in the next few years, and then you need it to grow by more than 25% each year. There are many such hypothetical cases you could come up with, but any case has to be around that *magnitude* of performance to justify the current share price. \n\nAnd again, that's for around 7% growth in the value of your investment. *Generational wealth?* For \"generational wealth\", the earnings and growth have to be so large in comparison with the company's previous peak financial performance that it's simply very unlikely. You need annual profits in the tens of billions in the next decade. Good luck.\n\nAnyway, go see it for yourself. I've ran the numbers. I've shown how i selected the parameters. I've made what i feel to be all reasonable efforts to offer a straightforward range of valuations for this company, using generous assumptions. Show me where I'm wrong.",

    "title": "Do Not Fight The Fed - Warning/Education",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a while since I wrote a post for Wallstreetbets. I thought given yesterday's FOMC meeting that it was a good idea to do so. I see a lot of you posting loss porn from failed call positions and I see an abundance of suggestions to continue buying Memestocks. You can buy whatever you want, but I am going to take a moment to say something.\n\n[Don't fight the fed](https://preview.redd.it/mfwcwr64thp91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63df8cc6f06a6c9441bf3b37cd2934d850bc42cf)\n\nStop fighting the Fed.\n\nYes, you, with your far OTM positions in calls on a company with a huge debt-to-equity ratio. You're taking a massive, massive risk. It is not the same risk you took in 2020 or 2021. Most of r/wallstreetbets has joined the sub since the pandemic crash. A lot of you are very young. I respect your interest in investing, trading, and looking for a fat gain, but you're in a different world. That should have been apparent over the past 6-9 months.\n\nThis is what a bear market looks like. This is how it feels. You can probably feel it in the back of your mind, the rough psychology of the market and how 'hope' of rallys and reversals are slowly getting ground out of you and everyone else. That's what investors/traders mean when they say \"Feels like a bear market\". It's an excruciating psychological process that's at work.\n\nOn the way up, thousands here chanted \"Do not fight the Fed!\" to every bear in town. Well, the fed is raising rates--fast, hard, and without mercy. The mantra is still true. When the Fed is EASING, you do not fight the fed and you follow the liquidity. You go for calls. When the Fed is TIGHTENING, you either 1) sit it out with a bundle of cash (Rich people strategy 101) and wait for a slaughter or 2) You move with the Fed and you short/buy puts.\n\nThat's the name of the game. You do not fight the Fed. They are far more powerful than you and all of us combined. They are more powerful than all of Wall Street to boot and nothing can stop them. They are an independent institution.\n\nPowell was **EXTREMELY** clear that they will not stop until they break the back of inflation and can see it laying dead-still on the mat. He's reiterating a lot of Volcker's language, \"Keep at it\". Look it up. If you want to know what's going on. That's the best analogy you've got in this.\n\nWhy do rates matter? Well, as you can guess it affects credit card debt, housing debt, and a multitude of other things. So why does it hit your memestocks? Because they eventually **have to refinance their debt and their payments will balloon. This is why they get shorted into the ground.**\n\nWhen the tide goes out, you will see who's skinny dipping. With the fed accelerating their balance sheet run off, that tide (liquidity) is being sucked out of the market. Everything will seem 'ok' until suddenly it gets very shallow, and then it's too late. Illiquid markets are extremely volatile and not in favor of bulls chasing green candles. Take a look at low market cap cryptos and how they trade. That's a prime example of how bad liquidity can lead to horrendous outcomes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"but we're almost back to the june lows! It's a perfect entry!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt isn't. In fact it could be one of the worst entries. When you're in a long decline, the longer trend is more likely to beat the shorter one. Now that we've been defeated at SPY 400-410, we're coming down to 367 with **momentum**. It will bounce and skid probably, but the odds are in the bears favor for it to break. This is where the 3300 estimates are coming from. The 3300 mark is from the much older trend of the entire market, but be warned...\n\nWe will overshoot.\n\n&gt;Everything is still very expensive. We could lose a lot more. Historically our PE for SPY is 14.9-15.98. We're sitting around 19 right now. Chances are when we bottom we will go under the mean, maybe 12-13ish. The market could lose another 20-30% and still be within a normal bear market.\n\nWe overshot to the upside, we will overshoot to the downside. I've traded bear markets before and it always happens. It's okay if you miss the bottom. It's not okay if you're leveraging in a bear market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Earnings Cuts are going to happen](https://preview.redd.it/j9eevdzpuhp91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe81d5720b3184eeff8dd7aeecdbbd83ecc8318a)\n\nHow does the next step down happen? Earnings cuts. Chances are someone will run us up into earnings, but these numbers are probably going to disappoint. Either this quarter, or next. You've already seen a slew of headlines of companies not offering guidance or preannouncing bad results. Looking at you FedEx (who also just raised shipping costs by 7%, driving more inflation into the system).\n\n\"But how can you be so sure? The numbers aren't out yet.\" Because the fed released a forecast. Their higher interest rate is going to have to be added into a company's free cashflow. If your company has debt, it'll have to get re-financed. Those projections help them estimate how much that's going to cost. Therefore, if it's 'higher rates and for longer' then it's going to cost more to have that debt, leading to lower free cash flow.\n\nPlus interest rates to curb demand is a deflationary act. If prices drop on things, well, that cuts into a company's earnings. All that clearance at Target? You saw how that turned out. Cut their EPS in HALF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrade safe. Trade wisely. I am very tired of seeing all the loss porn on the front page. I am seeing notes of self harm that's greatly disturbing me. I wrote years ago to be careful with GME and to protect your mental health.\n\nA bear market could be even worse if you lose your money now. The fed is coming for jobs and savings. If you lose here, you could find that your source of money gets taken out too. Bear markets are god awful. I was job searching after 2008. It freaking sucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that's it. I hope some of you listen. I know this sub is bias'd to bulls, but hey, someone has got to talk to y'all. Please don't do anything that will seriously harm your life. This isn't a time to gamble. Sitting on the sideline is a perfectly good strategy in a bear market. Rich people pretty much run the \"sit and wait\" system their entire life for generations to build wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add, there's absolutely no reason the market can't retrace all of the pandemic. No reason at all. It happens all of the time in markets for there to be a 100% re-tracement. Keep that in your mind when you're looking at these companies. They can completely round trip.",

Been following him for a while now, listen to him if you wanna make some $ or you continue buying the dip like a regard.\n\nIn my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/user/juffury3/comments/xh7kj1/the_last_time_we_had_25_fed_funds_rate_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I talked about my plans for the rest of September:\n\n&gt;\"I plan on closing the rest of my short term dated puts by the end of this month (the ones expiring in October and November). Already sold a few contracts last week at 200% gain.\"\n\n[Some trades so far for the month of September...](https://preview.redd.it/y7t8mxt6dgp91.png?width=1572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6d525ddb74b529351fede4a31d6d3531c56a291)\n\nI ended up closing the rest of my October puts leading up to FOMC, securing about 200% gains on most of those contracts. I bought those contracts August 16 when we perfectly bounced off the 200 daily MA of 431 (as predicted by many bears).\n\nIn hindsight, I should've held on to ALL of my October puts seeing that we're most certainly going to go lower, at least to the June low of 362 (weekly 200 MA is around this level too), if not a lower low (perhaps 340 the pre covid high). I was afraid of a post CPI or FOMC rally, so I ended up securing those profits. What can I say, too many regard bulls swearing upon a post CPI or FOMC rally... Should've just tuned out those regards and listened to my fellow bears.\n\nMy cash balance is currently sitting at 36k. I haven't touched any of my November puts. Will ride those bitches all the way down to at least the June low of 362. u/DesmondMilesDant is predicting a low or lower low by 2nd week of October and I tend to agree.\n\n[September 22, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/lkypylaedgp91.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7deb8735ff055c80d8287b3cfaac1b8eb566e55)\n\nI'll post an update when I've closed the rest of November puts. I expect my cash balance to be 60-70k by then.\n\nI'm expecting one last final bear market rally in mid-October, which will last till midterms in November before we see the true crash in Q4 2022 or Q1 2023.\n\nI might even buy SPY/GME calls to ride that bounce up or just sit on cash... waiting for the last entry point for new short/put positions before the real shitstorm hits. By mid November, I will exit all my meme stock calls (GME/BBBY) and go 100% near the money puts.\n\nI'm thinking we're gonna retrace all the way back up to 400 or so during the final bear market rally. Hard to tell now though... first we have to see how low we get in the next few weeks... Again, listen to your fellow bears and get your tickets to tendieland while they last. You only live once.",

Then AMC. Then loopring and NFT marketplace were supposed to take us to the moon. I was more cautious when BBBY came around and decided to hop in at $28, thinking it was a safe entry after all that volume and RC being on the board and having those $80 calls.\n\nWhat she fails to understand tho, is that between mine, her, and her boyfriend\u2019s salary, we make $500K per year so $150K is not bad. $4800 a month in payments to my broker? That\u2019s nothing. I can easily make that back fairly quickly but she refuses to let me open an account under her name. Her boyfriend doesn\u2019t care either way, he said he would help fund it, but she refuses. \n\nNow I\u2019m just a meme or some kind of joke to millions of people around the world because she went and panicked and called some upstart little kids who wouldn\u2019t know the first thing about day-trading because all they do is invest in \u201csafe\u201d boomer funds hoping to get close to 3% a year. What\u2019s the fun in that? How do they expect to make 100x gains quickly.\n\nThis sucks.  My wife won\u2019t talk to me and only her boyfriend can console her.",

If they don\u2019t kill it as an individual business, you can bet your ass that they\u2019ve got eyes on them as a potential acquisition target. \n\nWith Ballie Gifford (aka a key Tesla backer), BlackRock, Tencent, and Palantir, you\u2019ve got a recipe for something special about to happen.\n\nWay under valued right now: current market cap is $600M. They\u2019ve got MoU orders for 483 aircraft and the projected sale price is $4.5M per plane (my regard math puts that at ~$2.2B of sales (yes, I know it\u2019s just MoU\u2019s, but they\u2019re ruthlessly meeting their targets). If we continue with my regard math then they\u2019re undervalued by at least 3.6x (even more if you apply revenue multiples if you want to be extra regarded). \n\nTL;DR: this under the radar eVTOL will probably be a multi bagger in the next couple of years.

    "title": "The partnership between Immutable X and ...not \"GameStop\"",
    "selftext": " \n\nRereading through the 8-K I came upon this,\n\n\"Licensee acknowledges that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GameStop Corp., a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. To the extent any change of control occurs that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company, Licensee must, upon written request of Immutable, identify itself and its beneficial owners to Immutable and must not hide its identity\"\n\nIn the 8-K, the \"Licensee\" is GME Entertainment, LLC, not GameStop.\n\nSo GameStop created and owns a company called GME Entertainment, LLC, and *this* company is in partnership with Immutable X.\n\nNow look at this line: \"To the extent any change of control occurs that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company...\"\n\nWhat it is saying is that as of right now, GameStop outright owns GME Entertainment, LLC, and if any change in ownership were to occur, GME Entertainment *must* identify itself and and who owns it, upon the request of Immutable.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThere is a secret company, that the general public is not aware of, that is being built for the purposes of providing a marketplace for Web3 gaming assets (NFTs). This company is being funded by GameStop, is not shortable, but yet has the full support of GameStop shareholders. GameStop shareholders acted as Venture Capitalist when GameStop sold $1+ Billion into the open market. Shareholders bought into a startup company. Startups are inherently risky, but their payoff is generally much greater than the capital invested. To be a Venture Capitalist you much have money and generally, be an accredited investor, non of which the average person is. What most of GameStop shareholders might not explicitly be aware of, is that shareholders were given a once in a life time opportunity to be a Venture Capitalist and invest in a new era of gaming, Web3 gaming.\n\nIt's a risky investment, no doubt, but the potential is there and the right people and partnerships are in/coming into place, in my opinion. It's just a matter of patience for the startup to reach its full potential.\n\nAlso though, GameStop shareholders *could* (this is speculation) also more directly benefit if GameStop were to spin this company off and issues shares of GME Entertainment to GameStop shareholders. The result of that spin off is up for further speculation, but you get the idea.\n\nRight now the NFT marketplace is in Beta, and according to the filing,\n\n\" Platform Launch means the bona fide public release of the GameStop web-based NFT trading platform in the U.S. and certain mutually agreed upon non-US regions, which integrates Immutable X\u2019s layer two technology. **Platform Launch shall take place within twelve (12) months**, plus any Extension Periods, of the Effective Date\" Effective Date being 28 January 2022.\n\nThe \"real\" \"official\" bona fide NFT marketplace, the way in which it was built for (gaming NFTs) should be release within 12 months of January 2022, so about 4 more months. After launch, GME Entertainment has 24 months to hit $1.5 billion in sales in order to achieve milestone 4. Milestone 5 is $3 billion in sales within 24 months from the effective date.\n\nFrom the effective date, GME Entertainment has 2 years to meet all the milestones.\n\nLet's focus on the milestone sales of 1.5 billion dollars and turn that into a company valuation. From various websites, the market multiplier for software tech companies ranges from 5x-40x. Using the lower band to keep discussions more reasonable, 1.5 billion dollars in revenue would value the company at 7.5 billion dollars; 3 billion dollars in sales (milestone 5) is 15 billion dollars. So 7.5 - 15 billion dollars baseline. What the market decides is anyone's guess, but there will probably be a lot of speculation in the open market once all of this hits mainstream. If using GameStop shares outstanding, it would put GME Entertainment stock price at $50/share. So add $50 to whatever the current stock price of GameStop for simplicity.\n\nNow of course there are assumptions and speculations here, but considering that GME Entertainment is a startup, assumptions and speculations are required.",

So take everything I say as a suggestion, not fact with that being said; here is my Idea:\n\nAs we all know now, the combustion engine is slated to be killed, with some companies even stopping production as early as 2025. So suggesting an EV manufacturing company is going to take off isn't a hard thing to believe. What I myself do believe is that Rivian at the moment is falling into obscurity, with a net income of -1.7B, and a 52wk low of just $18.\n\nIf together we let this fall, to its low which by the look of things it's going to do. You could buy it dirt cheap.\n\nBut why, how could a failing EV company grow with subpar vehicles, especially in a growing competitive market?; well Rivian has partnered with Mercedes Benz to bring the first luxury Suv EV to the market. I think that this EV will take off rocketing Rivian to the top with, an ungodly amount of buy-ins.\n\nOnce again very new to this, and do not have a degree by any means this is just a hunch I have and with the help of this sub I think we could turn this stock into the next GME, let me know what you think (Might be the dumbest shit ever, might be the best buy ever we will see eh?.\n\n\\-Logonix Sepetember 30th 2022\n\n(0\\_&lt;)",

Chad CEO with beautiful, faithful wife (no bf) is managing your financial future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this monkey has had enough... Its time that we take control (planet of apes style).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nusing our guile and vigour (regarded plays and reckless ideology) we will assume management of a company and set it on a trajectory out of this fucking universe, it literally cannot go tits up, we have the ability to hype and pump anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith over 12 million members I'm sure there are quite a number of you who want to be a part of something huuuuuge. I\u2019m thinking its hostile takeover time. Together we will own a company and dictate its future and be responsible for its meteoric rise and inevitable fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea is simple, as a collective owner, WSB will be a majority shareholder of a (basically shithole) company. Every week/month there will be polls on WSB that will act as management decisions, these could include naming of the company, hiring and firing, autistic marketing campaigns, borderline market manipulation and grey accounting practise at best. Obviously, the legal structures and practises will have to be properly discussed but I have the upmost confidence that the WSB army can become the best activist investors and company managers in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA theoretical case study:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 1) Approach the council of apes, diamond hands and degens with a list of eligible companies (puny market cap) that are ripe for the dreaded WSB hostile takeover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 2) Once a suitable target is identified, we utilise the legal structures mentioned above (or whatever works ig) to buy out all the stonks and do hostile takeover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 3) Acquire majority stake in aforementioned shiddy company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 4) Fire entire board for all their misdeeds, stoodpid financial decisions and for not aligning with the new direction of the company (to da moon ideology)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 5) Replace board with the esteemed WSB legal structure (entity that represents the management polls of WSB)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 6) Hire Johnny Sins (hereby referred to as Mr.Sins) as company ambassador.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 7) Create the greatest meme hype train of all time, making GME, BBBY and AMC look like child\u2019s play and at the same time showcasing the true power and intellect of this sub. Use social media hype to influence a major cash infusion from the retail sector and the big booonks, allowing us to do whatever the fuck we want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 8) Perform borderline market manipulation, grey accounting practises and ethically dubious management decisions. (all legal doe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 9) Company financials moon (parabolically)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 10) Dump our stake at the appropriate time or diamond hand till death\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep 11) Stonks or loss porn (win/win for the sub)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, are you ready to take up your seat at our esteemed board?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink you have what it takes to run a company to the rings of Jupiter through your decision making?(answering WSB polls)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets make it happen tards.

    "selftext": "Some DD for all of you out there who are actually looking to stem some of the bleeding through the end of the year so that you can live to yolo another day. I\u2019ve been part of this sub from pre covid and GME and I\u2019m one of the few Auts on here who watches his girl get hit on by random guys for fun but still collects tendies to keep her looking good. \n\nThere\u2019s an impending CO2 shortage from planned maintenance shutdown of ethanol and ammonia plants as well as many other factors. CO2 has been in short supply for a while now and it\u2019s starting to create cracks in businesses that can\u2019t recycle it. Plenty of articles starting to pop up about it and it\u2019s been a bubbling issue for a while - CO2 is now the highest percentage increase for input costs in the beer industry since January 2020 because of all of this. \n\nWhat industries need to use C02? Soda and beer. \n\nWhat happens when they can\u2019t get C02? They can\u2019t make anything to sell and have to put their wives on OF. \n\nSoda manufacturers have zero way to recapture CO2 - that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been consolidating which lines are being produced, there\u2019s been shortages at the grocery stores, and prices have gone up. \n\nBeer manufacturers can recapture the CO2 - but it\u2019s expensive and only the big boys can do it well. There\u2019s only one big boy that is currently CO2 neutral when it comes to their supply chain and that\u2019s Budweiser/Inbev. They\u2019re one of the only companies out there that depends on something that\u2019s about to be in short supply but that doesn\u2019t need to purchase any. \n\nSo later this fall as the market crashes, your wife goes to the neighbors hot tub, and you crack open a cold one to watch her video afterwards - you may be limited on options at the store similar to what people in Africa and South America have seen happen with their selections since inbev has an effective monopoly in certain foreign markets.\n\nThey also just got back down to a 100% debt to equity ratio after their huge buyout 8 years ago or so that was the start of their downfall. I\u2019m seeing eagles on rockets flying to the moon for them though given their cheap recession proof portfolio, ownership of their supply chain inputs, risk off of CO2 shortages, and a dollar that\u2019s probably peaked and will begin weakening. \n\nTLDR: InBev owns CO2 recapturing equipment their competitors don\u2019t and can make money even if CO2 supplies dry up which is going to result in them smashing earnings estimates. The fed wants unemployment to rise and unemployed apes drink beer which will cause revenues to moon. Don\u2019t fight the fed - Buy $BUD. \n\n**Not investment advice, I\u2019m dumb and my girl shows herself to men online while her bf rails her. As of this week I own a lot of $BUD and am long on it. Do your own homework.**",

They are aiming for a revenue of about 1,9 B this year (Q1 was $446M and Q2 was $473M).\n\nIt is true that Palantir still is not profitable, and Karp says it will be in 2025 (people argue that if they stop the SBC program they would be already profitable). So okay 2 years no profit, I think Alex Karp is wrong here when you see that in one month Palantir is able to fork in 700M$ of signed deals you can only imagine what the company could do in 2023. I think the sales team is heating up, for commercial clients this would be sufficient. I mean if you are a government you dont want to speak to a VP of sales but to the CEO, so I think Alex Karp is still closing the government deals and the sales team is picking up the commercial deals to relieve some pressure from Karp.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmy4n4bkldr91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85a90b3f5cac230ac127bdb432ae5a5ff130811\n\nSo Palantir has made his way into western governments to make money and get them addicted to the product (some deals they signed this month are long term and end by 2028 for example). But next to this Palantir has got a nice war chest to get through these difficult times (bear market, war in Ukraine, inflation), because they got $2,4B in cash, no debt, option to withdraw $950M of credit (not from credit suisse lol), and $50,7 M of gold bars (dafuq). So no need for hedge funds to worry about the health of Palantir.\n\nSo why wouldn't you YOLO into this stock?\n\n\\-ChrisPBacon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My position](https://preview.redd.it/h5sc1yn0odr91.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32beae759d11b6c40c808f9413664b54f83bad18)",

    "title": "PARA Short Squeeze?",
    "selftext": "Is PARA setting up for a massive short squeeze? Short interest is above 11%, which is small potatoes compared to GME at the max, but other factors are in play.\n\nFirst, PARA is a profitable, investment grade company that sells for .42 sales. PARA is priced like it's going out of business, but it's growing revenue. PARA trades insanely low due to hedge fund shorts, the other side of their long NFLX.\n\nSecond, Buffett might own 25% of float possibly, after this quarter of new lows. I'm guessing that 25% is the Buffett limit. He owned 25% of ABC Cap Cities. Buffett already had 13% at the end of last quarter. Between the shorts and Buffett, 24-36% of PARA shares are spoken for.\n\nThird, PARA has about a couple of billion authorized for share buybacks. That we'll over 10% of the current market cap but call it 10%. So 34-46% of PARA shares would be spoken for if PARA did a share buyback.\n\nThe 11% that's short has no fundamental basis for the short. Moreover, with the slightest effort to buy back shares from PARA management, shorts might find a materially constrained supply of shares when they need to cover. The move up when it comes may be unusually violent.",

    "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short because I know most of you can't read. \n\nPlease note that I am making conclusions based on publicly available information from Cvent and Zoom's websites and some public social media posts. \n\nI have no inside information and don't know if this acquisition will happen.   \n\n\n**I'm placing a bet. Back in the pre-GME days, this is what we used to do here on Wall Street BETS.**   \n\n\n**What**: Zoom $ZM to acquire Cvent $CVT\n\n**Price target:** estimate deal will be priced at $8-$12/share \n\n**When**: possible announcement October 11-13 or November 8-9.\n\n**Why:** Zoom is dominating the virtual meeting and virtual event space. While virtual meetings continue to flourish in a post-pandemic world, virtual events have fallen off a cliff this year (see recent massive layoffs from virtual event specialists like Hopin, Bizzabo, etc). \n\nAttendees want to go back to in-person, and Zoom does not want to miss out on the lucrative event business. So Zoom created a new division, Zoom Events: [https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/event-platform/](https://explore.zoom.us/en/products/event-platform/).   \n\n\nZoom Events\n\n[Zoom Events feature-set completely overlaps Cvent's](https://preview.redd.it/przfqcujhor91.png?width=2370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa91648372c18d6e3a7b121dd6056f311c0ea511)\n\nThe Zoom Events sales team targets meeting planners and offers a SaaS solution for their **virtual** and **in-person** events, touting **hybrid** is the future of events. \n\nWhen I read up on their solution, it sounded an awful lot like Cvent ($CVT). Their feature set almost completely overlaps.\n\nI thought, isn't it weird that Zoom is now competing against Cvent, considering Zoom is one of the largest investors in Cvent: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cvent-to-go-public-via-merger-with-spac-dragoneer-growth-in-53-billion-deal-2021-07-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cvent-to-go-public-via-merger-with-spac-dragoneer-growth-in-53-billion-deal-2021-07-23).  \n\n\nIf Zoom is now competing against Cvent, shouldn't they have divested from the investment (they haven't as far as I've seen in public disclosures).   \n\n\nSo I started searching for Cvent and Zoom connections. Both companies are still promoting integrated apps in their respective app stores: [https://www.cvent.com/en/event-management-software/cvent-zoom-integration](https://www.cvent.com/en/event-management-software/cvent-zoom-integration) and [https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps/UKb\\_gycmQ5-iKIO8sjk8cQ](https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps/UKb_gycmQ5-iKIO8sjk8cQ).\n\nI then searched social media and noticed several Cvent employees had posted that they were participating in Zoom's annual Zoomtopia user conference: [https://zoomtopia.com/in-person/](https://zoomtopia.com/in-person/). I thought it was odd that a competitor would be allowed to exhibit at Zoom's event. \n\nSo I dug deeper on the Zoomtopia In-Person event website and clicked on register, and then it hit me. Cvent is providing the online registration for Zoomtopia: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x1v4bm4kor91.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e5fb1ca6f903d11f441cfc0883b97cf7b850e1\n\nZoom Events website shows they offer a competing online registration product, but instead of using it for Zoomtopia, they are using Cvent's. Even if their product was sub-optimal to use for a big event like Zoomtopia, Zoom would likely still follow Silicon Valley's mantra of \"eat your own dog food\" and use their in-house solution.\n\nAnother major virtual meeting player, WebEx, recently made the same decision that I believe Zoom is making. WebEx acquired Cvent competitor Socio to create WebEx Events: [https://www.webex.com/events.html](https://www.webex.com/events.html). \n\nSo I believe these hints are enough to believe Zoom will acquire Cvent. But when would the deal be announced? \n\nSince Cvent will be used extensively at Zoomtopia and Cvent staff will be in attendance, that would be the perfect time to announce (November 8-9). The other potential date is October 11-13 as Cvent is exhibiting at the industry's largest trade show, IMEX America, and has a huge booth very near WebEx Event's booth:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sz05y6ofmor91.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85556690e43b1f767c14ab85af1bf9079ead2864\n\nI may play with options, but for now, I'm all shares. Check my history to see my past bets. I've been making big plays here for years.   \nPositions 155,505 shares purchased for $997,257\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqedaj5pfor91.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5563e27c17045ec8c9158ee1b085cc66f1f952d",

The Fed interest rates hikes has killed its business.  With no change in rates for near future as I can tell.  The company looks to be going down rapidly.  Which looks and sounds like the same exact GME pre-explosion.  Even at $7 range there sees to be wild movements.  However I believe that the stock will continue to go down past it's BV.  Which I believe short interest will continue to increase as it falls in the next year.  I would expect interest to peek around 40% of the float.  With institutions holding most of the stock, insiders have very little power to stablize or control the desent.  I believe that RKT could be a play around or below BV for a massive short squeeze.  I have not purchase any stock in RKT as I am waiting for a bigger drop.  I do think this company will survive even if it needs to be restructured, with I would determine a fair value of around $1-$2.  So alot more to be shorted til it reached BV or my determined FV.",

    "title": "The Only Prediction You'll Ever Need (For Dummies Only)",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR: SPY will test 390-400 around mid November. This will be the last opportunity to sell longs and go cash (or short) in order to buy the mother of all dips (or hedge against the mother of all shitstorms coming in Q1 2023)**\n\nYou might remember [my last crayon drawing](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6odig/more_gay_bear_doom_and_gloom_labor_day_edition/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) where I talked about how we're trading eerily similar to 2008. From the ATH on January 4, we rejected twice off of the 200 daily SMA (April 21 and August 16), like how we did in 2008.\n\nSince then I've upgraded my crayon drawing skills. More colors and even more lines!\n\n[SPY During the 2008 Crash](https://preview.redd.it/k9zm9d4y8us91.png?width=1309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e574cadad72ea303089740c875ac21bc96774d25)\n\nLike u/DesmondMilesDant, I also believe that we are about to witness the final bear market before shit hits the fan, the market capitulates, and we see the true bottom. This is the bottom where you're supposed to BUY THE DIP.\n\nu/DesmondMilesDant is more well versed in TA astrology, so defer to him for that (experts only). I specialize in simplified crayon drawings (for dummies like myself). KISS amirite?\n\nAnyways, if the current market behaves similarly to 2008 (which it has been....) then we will be testing the corridor between the 50 SMA and 50 EMA for the next month or so (coincidentally through the midterms!!!). For SPY, that price range is 390-400.\n\nNotice how in 2008 when the 50 daily EMA (cyan line) crossed/over took the 50 daily SMA (green line), it signified the top of the final bear market rally. When and if this happens, you will have three choices:\n\n1. If you're risk averse, this would be the best time to sell longs/calls, accumulate cash, WAIT PATIENTLY (not for long just a few months), and then maybe buy the mother of all fucking dips.\n2. If you aren't a massive pussy and like to gamble (why are you even on this subreddit?), then not only do you sell all your longs, but you will also short this market. I will be adding to my SPY puts and calls on inverse leveraged ETFs (DRV, SPXU, UVXY, ...) My portfolio will be 100% puts by then.\n3. If you're a bull, hold onto all your long positions and watch as all your hard earned money vanishes before your eyes and you become a bagholder for the next few years (or maybe even a decade, hello stagflation of the 1970s?). I'll see you at Wendy's!\n\nSo in summary, below is what I see playing out. Note 50 EMA hasn't over taken the 50 SMA... yet. I don't know how to overlay 2008 candles onto other candles on TradingView (I have the free version, all my moolah is in stonks). I'm really regarded too. But my powerpoint skills are on point... Changed transparency on 2008 candles, overlaid pictures, take out those crayons and drew away. It's legit. Trust me bro.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Only Prediction You'll Ever Need](https://preview.redd.it/wx3tq2sz8us91.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=749c042eb72ff25d3916397ef8220fef43a2a490)\n\nIn my last post, I promised that:\n\n&gt;I'll post an update when I've closed the rest of November puts. I expect my cash balance to be 60-70k by then.\n\nSold all my short-dated October/November puts for gains of 200-400%... I turned roughly 20k into 60k. Proof in my previous posts. Used that cash to go long for this final bear market rally. Calls on meme stocks like CVNA and GME. I have BBBY calls too, but I expect those to expire mostly worthless lol. I have SPY calls too.\n\nI have about another 10k or so sitting in cash. Will probably buy more SPY calls next week using that idle cash. Virtually all my calls expire in November, because I expect this bear market rally to be short-lived. It's a quick pump and dump. I won't get too overly greedy (famous last words). I'll be happy with a mere 50% gain on these calls. Either way by early November I'll be selling all my calls (even at a loss) and going 100% short. I'll post an update then.\n\nGood luck. You only live once.\n\n[October 8, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/oqwxlh419us91.png?width=1467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77b8b5d50246cd3a700b7bd7a03a9e2a88859539)",

    "selftext": "I just finished watching the Netflix documentary on the $GME boom (I can still remember a part of it) but I didn't knew what was going on with Roaring Kitty and Robinhood etc... I remember people posting about something that Robinhood shut down the buy button on $GME but at that time, I didn't no what it meant or what it would cause. A couple of months ago I read a book about times where the gold standard was still the main economic system (btw it was really good) however, I've never been a huge fan of regulated markets, I understand that the SEC shuts down the market, if it crashes more than 20% a day and stuff, so black Monday can't happen again. But fr in my opinion no one, I don't care if it's f\\*cking Robinhood, the SEC or the f\\*cking president of the USA, no one should be able to make that call on shutting down the market or regulate stuff. I don't think that there shouldn't be any laws though, it's okay that pump and dump is illegal, the government can bust these people I don't give a f\\*ck, but if the market is dumping 20% a day there's a  reason for that and they shouldn't just be able to \"shut it down\". Btw f\\*ck you Robinhood, you were responsible one of the greatest market manipulations in the history of the US market, by shutting down that buy button! According to sources like theprotocol.com Robinhood got sued but they won the lawsuit (link: [https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit)). It makes me question how they were able to win a lawsuit, because to me there was no doubt, it was market manipulation. For real this stuff is a joke, the SEC is busting Elon (link: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226)) for some shit-posts he does on twitter but they don't bust Robinhood for refusing investors to buy a stock (which of course lead to a downtrend in that particular stock). Robinhood was aware (they must have been aware) that it would cause a crash of the stock  and if they didn't they maybe shouldn't run an app that's made for investing!",

    "title": "VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY",
    "selftext": " Why does volatility increase if liquidity decreases? \n\nAs you know by now, the Fed is reducing liquidity on the market by raising interest rates and reducing the balance sheet and denying many people and businesses access to credit. An important component of volatility is the market cap. For example, if a company has a market cap of 100M, the movement of 50M is sufficient to significantly increase or decrease the stock. If, on the other hand, we want to move the price of a company with 1000 billion market caps, 500 billion will be needed to generate the same movement.\n\n You can therefore pump companies like [$GME (GameStop Corp.)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/gme) but not like [$AAPL (Apple)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/aapl) \n\nThe companies' market caps have shrunk dramatically this year. \n\nThis means that far less money is needed to move the major indices both down and up. \n\nIn fact, it is much more frequent to see collapses and rises of more than 3% in a single day.\n\n In the chart below ([$SPX500](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/spx500) daily) you can see the difference between 2021 and 2022. Look at the size of the candles and the fluctuations of 2022 compared to those of 2021. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MY PROFILE](https://etoro.tw/2DGv45L)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzp2gzk85zs91.jpg?width=1843&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=473be23961d335dc69ec66ec69e8f2bac25e206d",

    "selftext": "# Cost to borrow\n\n[cost to borrow for $AMC trending up](https://preview.redd.it/85pa5wigo8t91.png?width=967&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f65482309e906676c3f38937c94c88f9958b7f9c)\n\n**Cost to borrow:** Annual fee paid to borrow shares and use those shares to short the stock. The fee that the borrowers are paying are approximately 20%. For well over a year its been approximately 0.5-1%. \n\nBetween the bounces of $50-$30 last year the cost to borrow was approx 1% which is $0.30-$0.50 per share. Currently we have 100% utilization since February. The current price is approx $6, 20% of $6 is $1.20 per share to borrow for a year in comparison to the 30-50 cents they paid last year. \n\nShort sellers renewing positions need to borrow at higher rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Price\n\n[price of AMC down](https://preview.redd.it/tlg6p4kbp8t91.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c40b65a6ca0ecb1d5ddd7774f7f2f8e7e5d4b5e6)\n\nWhen a stock tanks and hits its low, in the brains of many WSBers... the stock is done. Why buy? \n\nYet that should be the opposite mentality people have. AMC hasn't had any bad news for it to come this low, so the price action seems mostly short and not fundamental. What does a short seller do when a stock hits its low? Same thing a long investor does when it peaks. **CLOSE POSITION**\n\n**How do short sellers make money?** \n\nThey make money in two ways, first is by closing position at it's lowest point and second would be by synthetic shorting via options and selling OTM calls to do so. The problem here is the cost to borrow is getting expensive. synthetic shorting seems to be hitting a wall with the price not getting lower, the IV is low as hell so they arent profiting. Sooner, rather then later... the stock might have no where else to go but go up.\n\nNow here's the thing... if it goes up from here, options are dirt cheap to exercise. Comparable to $50 \\[$5,000\\] per contract to exercise... it only costs approx $600 to exercise. If this thing were to rip, things could get crazy quick, exercising is cheapest its been in a LONG time.\n\nThis is why I am bullish on $AMC.\n\nI am also bullish on $GME. Take a look at the DTC/SIR \\[over 15\\] and SI at 20%.",

    "selftext": "***I think its pretty obvious what's about to happen.***\n\n***I believe Ryan Cohen only has interest in BABY and Gamestop is the buyer under Section 2 and he was already speaking with Carl Ichan about being the Well-Capitalized Acquirer under Section 3and that's why he says he believes*** **Bed Bath presently satisfies financial sponsors\u2019 interest. Ryans motive was and still is to spin-off Baby. The post yesterday was to indirectly say that they have found an agreement.**\n\n1. ***Carl Ichan to buy Bed Bath and Beyond***\n2. ***Gamestop to buy Baby of Bed Bath and Beyong after Carl Ichan takes control***\n\n# RC Ventures LLC to $BBBY on 6th March 2022\n\n**We believe Bed Bath needs to narrow its focus to fortify operations and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand, while simultaneously exploring strategic alternatives that include separating buybuy Baby, Inc. (\u201cBABY\u201d) and a full sale of the Company.**\n\n**2. Seek to Monetize the Ultimate Destination for Babies**\n\nAnother path that can streamline Bed Bath\u2019s strategy and **unlock value trapped within the Company\u2019s underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the BABY banner.** Given that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023 with a double-digit growth profile and at least 50% digital penetration, we believe it is likely much more valuable than the Company\u2019s entire market capitalization today. Assuming continued growth and low double-digit margins, we estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis. We believe under the right circumstances, BABY could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other ecommerce-focused retailers, and justify a valuation of several billion dollars.\n\nIn the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. **Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders. Notably, BABY\u2019s high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers.**\n\n**3. Evaluate a Full Sale to a Well-Capitalized Acquirer**\n\nThe final path we want to raise for consideration is a full sale of Bed Bath, in its current form, to one of the many well-capitalized financial sponsors with track records in the retail and consumer sectors and the ability to pay a meaningful premium. The past 10 years have shown that Bed Bath faces a difficult existence in the public market. The market is not giving the Company nearly enough credit for BABY\u2019s value. A sale that can lock in a substantial premium for shareholders and provide Bed Bath the flexibility of the private market could be an ideal outcome for customers, employees and investors. **We believe Bed Bath presently satisfies financial sponsors\u2019 interest in specialty retailers with recognizable brands, niche assets and sub-banners, and margin expansion opportunities.**\n\n**A private market participant with a long-term vision could unlock meaningful value by running the core business for cash and initiating a public offering for BABY at the optimal time. After stripping out the sizable costs of being a public company and setting a more focused strategy, we suspect Bed Bath\u2019s core business \u2014 excluding BABY \u2014 could generate attractive earnings.**\n\n[Source](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\n# Why would Carl Ichan want Bed Bath and Beyond?\n\n1.

Ross, Jr., held a majority of the debtor's first-lien debt of $488 million. **The second group, led by Carl C. Icahn, held a majority of the second-lien debt of $165 million, and 40% of the first-lien debt.** When it appeared that a consensual plan was unattainable, the debtor proposed a Section 363 sale of its assets. **Following a bidding war between the groups at an auction, the Icahn group emerged the winner** and obtained approval from the bankruptcy court to purchase the debtor's assets under Section 363(b). **Under the terms of the Icahn group purchase, a new Icahn entity would purchase the Westpoint assets, the first and second liens would be released, and the equity in the new entity would be shared among the first-lien lenders** (which would receive shares valued at $489 million, the value of their first liens as determined in the sale order), the second-lien lenders (which would receive shares valued at $95 million), **and the Icahn group (which would purchase a stake in the new entity for $187 million in cash)**. **This sale structure assured that the Icahn group would obtain majority control of the debtor's business, through the equity in the new entity distributed to it on account of its first-lien and second-lien positions, combined with the equity interest it purchased with cash.**\n\n[Source](https://www.wilmerhale.com/insights/publications/trumping-seniority-recent-decisions-in-westpoint-stevens-and-trump-entertainment-allow-bankruptcy-process-to-undermine-intercreditor-terms-june-17-2010)\n\n# Ryan Cohen hires Icahn proxy solicitor Harkins Kovler for possible Bed Bath fight\n\n**RC Ventures has retained Harkins Kovler,** the solicitor **frequently used by prominent activist investor Carl Icahn in his corporate battles**, said the sources, who are not permitted to discuss the private matter publicly\n\n[Source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ryan-cohen-hires-icahn-proxy-solicitor-harkins-kovler-possible-bed-bath-fight-2022-03-10/)\n\n# Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Adds New Directors in Deal With Activist Ryan Cohen\n\nThe home furnishings retailer added **Marjorie L.

    "selftext": "Rumble just dipped to 7.72 down 5% from yesterday and continues its progressive downward spiral in Wall Street. Great time to invest and here\u2019s my opinion on why.\n\nRumble is a great long term investment as they promote, and so far have delivered, a free speech platform with many big names that have been \u201ccancelled\u201d on previous platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and other social media platforms, as it\u2019s now known that all these popular media sites are controlled by big corporations money who want to censor certain people for having opinions that differ the head masters.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to play the long game I\u2019m sure this downward crescendo won\u2019t last.\n\nThe company is operating at a loss but has gained so much traction over 2 years that I believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before the big turnaround happens. Not only this but the company only costs less than 1% of its total value ($2.16Big Billies) to operate yearly and is steadily increasing revenue year by year. The reason is they only have 35 employees as it\u2019s a free speech site and doesn\u2019t need major regulations. The only thing they need to focus on is ads to get their name out there more, hence operating at a loss. Regardless, their growth of users from 2020 to 2022 was ~1 million users to ~44 mill! Streaming hours went from ~90 hours daily to ~8,900!!! AMAZING GROWTH AND ITS NOT STOPPING!\n\nRumble is by the people for the people and I\u2019m all for it. To me this kind of mirrors the GameStop situation and how it got shorted way too early by the big heggies. Do with your money what you want but I\u2019m taking mine over to Rumble in support of FREE SPEECH INTERNET!\n\nE: Wow, 30+ comments and 0 likes? I wonder why\u2026\nI\u2019ll be making update posts weekly, this is the next GME and I\u2019m not missing out. All time low of 6.75 now, down 17% in one day for no reason at all\n\nE2: So far every argument made against it has been disproved, not one logical statement has been made as to why it\u2019s not a good investment \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f until you can convince me otherwise it\u2019s $RUM TO THE SUN!!!!    \n\nE3: PUNCHIN RUM TO THE SUN!!! \u2600\ufe0f\ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udd4a\n\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",

Tesla is not \"the *next* Apple/Amazon/Netflix\"... Tesla is the **first** Skynet.\n\nSecondly, Institutions **know** Tesla's value now. My last post made it clear to me that retail (you guys) has clearly bought into the Institutional FUD media-machine. Even Tesla bulls were buying puts. Wow. So what happens when Elon tweets this evening that he's not selling any more (plsss do it tonight elon)? institutions already collected on all your sales at the bottom as well as Elon's liquidity yesterday at rock bottom prices, leaving on the sidelines this huge *emotional-retail buying vaccum of sheer unadulterated FOMO-ready* for their beloved TSLA stock. I reckon you guys might actually blow this thing sky high this week. Thats why I just added to my existing 3x leveraged position with some extra OTM calls expiring this friday. Fuck it. I'm literally all in on everything except my house, and my Model Y, and my wife.\n\npositions: \n\n* 930x $TSLA\n* 25,000x $3LTP, 580p\n* 20x 11/11, $250 calls\n* 200x 28/10, $250 calls\n* (Some random $GME positions as a hedge in case you guys dont buy because your stubborn or something)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2pxn1m49zv91.png?width=681&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=162399cb4c57cb89bb0388c04bed7964bd748717\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jysfkykc9zv91.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71ba8fba7e26cefe72236dd9a74dc2fe7bb623cf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5o6sygd29zv91.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a996695f6b9d16286095e74ef2adbd7c6ea185f4",

    "title": "NFT twitter coming to reddit with the mindset that they are expanding to a new platform is like European explorers claiming to \"Discover America\" despite natives populating the region for 20,000 years. I've lived both sides for a decade.",
    "selftext": "I'm 36, which is ancient in the NFT scene. But I hold a unique perspective on the evolution of Reddit and it's influence on the NFT scene. Not many have seen it all from both sides.\n\nIt's a continuation and an natural consequence of many sociopolitical sentiments as an extension of this platform and the desire to create, and even \"possess\" certain memes. (Yes you, the degenerate gambler with a desktop folder containing the dankest pepes and wojaks you've saved for a banger)\n\nWhether the average redditor likes it or not, NFT's are here, and here to stay. Prior to the launch of spooky season NFT's, any and all information about the NFT space was found on Twitter. The culture there is so rich that it is widely considered to have carved out it's own corner of sovereignty on the platform, ultimately resulting in the adoption of wallet verified PFP's.\n\nEarly in NFT's, Most collectors had migrated from the prophetic GME saga having manifested itself the first week of January 2021. (Long story there of course). As new collectors piled into the space after the mint of BAYC in May 2021, newcomers adopted the language and outlandishly high risk behavior made famous by WSB during the 2020 bull run.\n\nNFT's are currently in the depths of it's first bear. Many of the loudest personalities have left.\n\nWhat must be understood about \"NFT Twitter\" is the players showing up on Reddit are the Biggest names in the space. They are the one's who stayed through this bear and are making the push to break down the walls separating the core NFT scene from the famously toxic sentiment from the Reddit scene. Then, Reddit adopted web3 in early 2021.\n\nHowever, many of the collectors extending themselves to Reddit don't realize the culture and lifestyle they live began here. They believe they are \"Founding NFT Reddit\" not realizing the history traces itself back over a decade with the rise of the first memes.\n\nTo be fair, there's no good place for \"Us\" to land on reddit. NFT subs are dumpster fires and \"Starting out own community\" isn't that simple. \n\nA potential point of friction: BAYC owners consider themselves \"Apes\". Obviously this terminology has a different meaning here. But there is a reason the avatars are \"Apes\". It was inspired by the GME saga through 2020 and 2021. This may cause some tension, but it's no big deal. Many \"Ape\" owners were here with you in 2020.\n\nWhat must be understood about the NFT space is this: \"NFT\" (non-fungible-token) is a technology. It cannot scam you. It has no free will. Any claim that \"NFT's are scams\" is like saying \"Websites are scams\" which misses the point entirely.\n\nThat said, the technology is used to scam many many people. Even those who have build their personal brand on web3 security have fallen victim to scams, typically in the form of social engineering.\n\nSome tips to protect yourselves from web3 scams:\n\n1: If someone you don't know DM's you with a link. Never click it. Ever.\n\n2: \"Free NFT's\" are worthless by definition. Again, DM's are scams.\n\n3: \"Whitelists\" \"Allow Lists\" ect in DM's from someone you don't know are scams\n\n4: You cannot stop someone from sending you an NFT. If you see and NFT in your wallet you've never seen before, It's a scam. DO NOT INTERACT WITH IT other than to \"Hide\" it.\n\n5: If you use Discord, Disable DM's. No NFT founder will DM you. If they do, they have no idea what they are doing. 6: PURCHASE A HARDWARE WALLET. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WALLET FROM ANYWHERE OTHER THAN DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURER.\n\nI am happy to answer any and all questions related to NFT's. Please ask in comments because I will no respond to DM's (as mentioned above).",

    "selftext": "Here we go. A very clear chart showing the trend of META's **quarterly revenue**, the polemic **R&amp;D expense as a % of total revenue** and the **Free Cash Flow generated in the same period**. I have plotted the last 9 periods (quarters) so you can see the trend and then we will compare with the chart of Meta share price where you will see clearly why/how the market is concerned. \n\nTake 1 minute to read properly and understand the trend:\n\n[Yes, FCF my friends. The FCF!!!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/e8n65aywxsw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a4451bb8606c90e5ebc61359f7a8730f7234d7)\n\nSo what is the problem with the above chart?\n\nThe FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.\n\nThat's why you see the following QoQ share price action in the same period (I have plotted 99$ in Sep 30, but it should be 27 Oct):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixamkk9jysw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78772ec49e6c324d8e4f48add37ba5476178d434\n\nBut hold on, what is all that cash burn rate? What is Zuckerberg doing with our cash?\n\nWell he anounced the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|In Billions $|2022|2023|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total Expenses|86|100|\n\n100 F\\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. \n\nBut... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[So still spending 10 Billiones below what he told us for FY2022](https://preview.redd.it/82o77zt30tw91.jpg?width=1560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97950cce7dfe04df98895f0b8e0ebf757d69e4ef)\n\nThe capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, \"increase in AI capacity\"\n\nSo...\n\nhow is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1h23m1j0tw91.jpg?width=724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3dcd3daecd6abddbe16299ebb189ae29ab02a2\n\nThe share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. \n\nOCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I hold a bag of 200 shares with an avg. of 160$ I beleive... This is not a financial advice, nor I know how to advice you. Just buy APPLE for the long term....I mean do your own research. Ah...I hold a bag of Apple Puts that also hurts.",

Of that, due to high insider and institutional holdings, only about 10 million are available for trading. 20 million shares short interest give it a 200% SI. $GME had SI of 150% at its high. Not saying my calculated setup is a guarantee for a squeeze but a good start. Daily price swings on low volume indicate that the stock is tight as hell.\n\nAlso, $GEO, while still heavily leveraged has underlying assets that give the company a fair share price of about $20, based on reproduction values of recent transactions. Not even included here is their subsidiary which is a cash machine.\n\nIt\u2018s basically one of a few stocks that will hold up during a recession, make their interest payments leverage less problematic relative to the increasing rates in general, and provide a big margin of safety, since the company provides enough FCF to deleverage and has enough assets to sell for deleveraging.\n\nIf you don\u2018t like the fact that GEO also operates correction facilities, spare me with your woke opinion, it\u2018s about making money.",

    "title": "META Yolo Long &amp; Short term thesis",
    "selftext": "My $META Long Thesis as of today  \\*Meta is $88 and has a June 2015 Market cap.\n\nFirst of Degens I don't like FB which has 2 billion users still a day I also don't care much for mark Z which is either James Halliday  from Ready player one or IOI, I feel its the latter. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81o9ob4e9tx91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec399ad44901de81c8023e2ea495580e954fe9d\n\n\\*I don't care for their policies but I do still keep FB because of family and friends, easiest way to find someone, I also Use IG a lot more lately, and whatsapp. \n\n\\* I don't care for Z's meta dream currently but I like the cash generating machine and I like todays 2015 valuation. Here is my thesis for long $META. \n\nMETA dropped -38% in the last 8 days! Which is a +60% upside to OCT 27th prices. I have a feeling funds will be averaging down soon. See charts below. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrzy8aklftx91.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bfeff5b048823067907033f7fc049ca2535e23\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yf06wq8patx91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a967cbf7c19800ac2970d23463433cae9e6796\n\nFYI I currently have 1,000 shares so far about $96 average, I have been DCA in. I also have about $23,000 in Long call options 500+ various. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30mktd0catx91.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492ea68ffa084cde5757ec91d0eb713d76c7a38d\n\nFirst of lets talk about why META is down. Obviously when other tech stocks, some of the biggest in the world can drop -20% overnight like AMZN recently did, NFLX -39% overnight it shows we are in one of the most volatile markets ever. Never have we seen such giant market caps drop this much. So this for 1 presents a big opportunity for me. \n\n :Note NFLX has recovered from that -39% overnight drop and is still up 65% since even with the big drop this past week. It recovered 88% in around 4 months time even with the NASDAQ falling -30% since its drop. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/871e3q18ctx91.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e12efa6bbc5b3e13656784111d463108b1784ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4n4swedbtx91.png?width=1372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61f8095042e1eea793b164924b1f09779c81176b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main reason META is down is because of their spending, but many think Meta is spending only on the METAVERSE which is not the case. Their big spending is for the following which will generate record future cash flow with their current ad rev strategy on new platforms. \n\n**Reasons for future Rev growth even in a recession.**\n\n1)Instagram reels fully monetized \n\n2)Whatsapp &amp; Messenger monetization \n\n3) New AI Discovery Engine to make ad targeting more effective with higher average revenue per user.\n\n4) 2.93+ Billion family users fully monetized.\n\n5)An economic downturn recovery &amp; or more spending for ads again. \n\n**Revenue declined slightly because of the following &amp; can rebound quick**\n\nIMO it is Cyclical as number of users are increasing and user time is rising.\n\n1) U.S. Dollar was beating other currencies and Meta gets a lot of ad rev in international markets. \n\n2) A lot of ads from finance have slowed, the highest paying ads, once we sees a rise in market sentiment those ads come back. \n\n3)Instagram and facebook  reels are not being monetized YET which gets 140 BILLION reels played DAILY!, neither is Messenger and Whatsapp.\n\n4)Apples 2021 Privacy changes, Note The New AI discovery engine will fix this for Meta.\n\n5) Mark and management have started record spending currently on infrastructure /AI discovery engine which is what they are spending the most. \n\n6) 2022 expenses $85-87 2023 projected $96 to $101 billion, which Meta can still be cash flow positive but Mark should and could revamp some spending and do this over 2 years vs 1 and the stock could see a massive move up as funds come back.\n\n7) Many funds have far higher averages and IMO could start averaging up. \n\nThese funds below have added before the big drop! Algos have likely been selling as well. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt0m3axigtx91.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82cce52a2e077bf7e6c704278a2e4b463ebda4d\n\n[META is still top 100 revenue generating companies in the entire world ranked at 65 for rev, and 17 out of 7126 for Earnings STILL.](https://preview.redd.it/qbtgcdfdhtx91.png?width=1293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863a7752f43c17aea1b9b7d5a40ba6122dc50e3e)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8eyumlcjtx91.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580994eecdec4c399d2b3772e1f777f973544164\n\nIf the meteverse works out this company is projected to 10x to 25x from todays valuations. 236 Billion and could bring in more revenue than the major stocks with massive overheads AMZN WMT etc with META having little overhead. \n\nTLDR: If meta comes out with a revised spending plan the stock could gap up overnight, They could stretch spending over 2 years vs 1. Even if Metaverse does not work out it can easily 3x from here as spending is for AI ad growth with new infrastructure. Funds Should start to average down soon. \n\nHope you enjoyed this DD. I like buying Undervalued stocks I got in GME at $4.50 and posted here about it. Not saying Meta is going to go up but I am using profits this year to YOLO it.",

Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.\n\nThe company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.\n\nCompany doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.\n\nStill expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.\n\nDebt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.\n\nCurrent Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.\n\nROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.\n\nROE is in recover, so GG\n\nROIC worsen and ROA is stable\n\nThis suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.\n\nIncome quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.\n\nGross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.\n\nThere are \"***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives\"*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*\n\nIn the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.\n\nFundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.\n\nWith current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? Any ideas? Suggestions? Feel free to comment! :D\n\n*I do not own any position in the company and This is not financial advice*",

When the stock increased in value, this led to investors buying it again and stop shorting it, which led to a ridiculously high demand and the prices skyrocketed.\n\nUpstart probably has the potential to do the exact same thing but on an even higher scale because of the sheer number of shorted stocks.\n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t have any knowledge about investing, but wouldn\u2019t it be funny to set Wallstreet on fire once again?",

    "title": "Thoughts on AMC minor upswing for calls ending December 2022",
    "selftext": "     Avatar was the highest grossing film in history, released in 2009. Unfortunately AMC went public in 2013, and this prevents me from looking at a mega blockbuster impact on stock price. We saw this year that Top Gun had a sizeable effect on AMC price https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amc-stock-price-meme-top-gun-movie-record-tom-cruise-2022-5\n\n    I got into trading last year just as the GME/AMC hype was about to peak and was able to make $5k profit from $500 in ape level day trading dips.\n\n    I collected all profits and just dipped, but now I have returned to trade again. I didn't know much about trading back then, but since then I've studied over about 200 of hours of lecture, theory and just basic broker navigation tutorials (I switched to Thinkorswim causing me to learn a new interface since I left Robinhood). I understand immediately that this is not enough experience or general knowledge, which is what leads me to this hallowed place.\n\n    I'm bringing this information up to state that I'm still learning but I've 'successfully\" navigated day trading and followed volume like a remora eel.\n\n    Is it too bullish to have faith in James Cameron for a solid gain in AMC?  \n\n    I have been listening to the morning pre-market calls in this forum discussing how CPI is wonky and inconsistent with reality. Will it be too risky to think that everyone that saw Avatar 13 years ago will now bring their children to see it and make AMC puffed up for end of year calls?",

    "selftext": "Yes my doomer blah blah is coming out and no I don\u2019t have any positions yet since I only just realized this by getting caught up on current events. No this isn\u2019t advice but looking for confirmation bias from the most hairbrained community I know. Yes mods, I now it\u2019s about the forbidden currencies but my point is about the actual market.\n\nPSA: I\u2019m pretty sure \ud83c\udf3d currencies  are about to crash the stock market. I could very easily be wrong but the market is in the process of de-hedging because of a rumored FED pivot due to inflation coming down. The VIX and the VVIX (volatility indexes) are breaking down into bullish falling wedges. The market just had two of the craziest gains since 2008.\n\nReason why I think we will crash. FTX is a major grypto player who is going bankrupt as we speak. There is news all over for this so I won\u2019t elaborate there. What is important is that large hedge funds and banks have been pushing for grypto ETFs and the like so investors could diversify into grypto. These ETFs, hedge funds, and the like are all about to experience a massive drop in the value of these grypto currencies.\n\nThis is exactly like 2007-2008 where the bankers created a bunch of financial products based on mortgages (supposedly stable) and the riskiness of it all caused a major meltdown. the globe has already seen an evaporation of $32 trillion and I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re about to see several more go. \n\nI\u2019m looking at companies like COIN, GME, AMC, RIOT, MARA, and the like to be the ones to fall (yes, they are already down substantially).\n\nYou could say that grypto itself has already crashed with \ud83c\udf3d being down so far from the high but it\u2019s been relatively contained so far. We are only now in the process of uncovering how far the roots go.\n\nBe safe and God bless!\n\nTL:DR \ud83c\udf3d and it\u2019s brethren are about to take the stock market down with it.",

I was under extreme stress from my irresponsibility with my money.\n\nWhen WSB started to boom from BBY, GME &amp; AMC, along with the wild revelations of how RobinHood was running it's business, I saw a lot of people lose everything and others made millionaires overnight. I read how regular people where managing their financial lives. How they learned from their mistakes and their rationale behind the stocks they chose to buy.\n\n**This community, and the people in it, encouraged me to get my life together.**\n\nI went from making 60K/y and having literally nothing in terms of savings ($0.28) to, making 45k/y (Changed jobs), building a budget, organizing my financials and having enough money to take (good) care of my wife and I. **To make purchases with cash!** I started to buy stocks in industries that interested me, talking to boomers, reading what you guys liked.\n\nI was able to take money out of my account and invest. Albeit, not a lot, but something is better than nothing.\n\nI decided to write this post as a thank you to this community. All of you, every one, pushed me to become a better version of myself I never thought possible.\n\nAlso, Here is my current Portfolio.

    "title": "Unwrapping Wrapped GME Part 1: Who Made This Shit?",
    "selftext": "Hi kids!\n\nAllow me to re-introduce myself. I did a few pieces of DD wayyy back when, such as seeing wut Credit Suisse was doing, questioning Fidelity's lending practices and the difference between beneficial/registered ownership, and others. After the events of the past few weeks though, I felt the need to \"come out of retirement\" and set a couple things straight, starting with Wrapped GME. I'm purposely going to keep these posts as a series of extremely narrow topics because shit is complex, yo. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n# TL:DR Wrapped GameStop was created by FTX and Serum in conjunction with Binance, Jump Trading, Genesis Trading, and Alameda Research.\n\nLet's start with the token Wrapped GameStop:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ec08e59ed827be587897edcdbff59215e785496](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ec08e59ed827be587897edcdbff59215e785496)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2wq2fxwjg0a1.jpg?width=2830&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bf22290aad86e8e2d2342cb25e7b7d62abf8029\n\n \n\nAs of writing, there are 207 holders with a supply of 10,000,000 GME. Let's take a look at some of the top holders:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ec08e59ed827be587897edcdbff59215e785496#balances](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ec08e59ed827be587897edcdbff59215e785496#balances)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l333h37zjg0a1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97ab9d814faca198374c0bca5057809c401feda7\n\n Well that's interesting, huh? Let's put this in a more simplified format: I'm only going to include the named addresses at this point, we'll get to the unnamed ones after or in another part. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc0dt8d0kg0a1.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed4988264a5f711320075bf2ee321e1e6023ece5\n\n \n\nWhat are the odds? 13 named addresses all in the top 100 holders. All part of or associated with who? That's right, FTX. Now, I know what some of you may be thinking; shitcoins are sent all the time to addresses, so that doesn't necessarily mean shit. I'd say that's fair, until we look at the \"genesis block\" of when GME was created. Just so happens, it's on public ledger! If you look under transfers and go all the way to the last page (12), you'll see where it all began:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2a893a8a6ea8ecb1a4654c060a1774d50067ecaa3f44af3ab387566198b592a9](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2a893a8a6ea8ecb1a4654c060a1774d50067ecaa3f44af3ab387566198b592a9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x5ux8fe2kg0a1.jpg?width=3514&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7832a1b54e886b64e22b7896c30bf96a6c909359\n\n \n\n2.5 million tokens to four addresses: [0xef7d6661fae2082ef0cecd42b322a3960eb87f66](https://etherscan.io/address/0xef7d6661fae2082ef0cecd42b322a3960eb87f66), Serum: Deployer, FTX Exchange, and FTX Exchange 2. Created (as of writing) 659 days ago (Jan 26, 2021). When did FTX launch the GME Token? Jan 27, 2021\n\nLet's walk through some of the initial transfers of this coin:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rk61w834kg0a1.jpg?width=2748&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=913a07b2af78ffdab3f5bc0d594062d8964e0a19\n\n \n\nThat looks pretty fucking suspect, no? Doesn't look like some shit coin a kid in his mom's basement created. Are they all involved in the FTX fiasco?\n\nSerum: [Needed a special fork after](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/solana-based-serum-may-compromised-151742537.html)\n\nBinance: [Broke the story](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589283421704290306)\n\nJump Trading: [Feeling the heat](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/ftx-bankruptcy-will-affect-drw-jump-sme-cboe-trading)\n\nGenesis Trading: [Halted Withdrawals](https://www.ft.com/content/b6680e41-56d1-4a18-99b3-569bb6d3d999)\n\nAlameda is self explanatory as they're owned by FTX.\n\nClosing out this post, I hope I've settled the debate on WHERE the Wrapped GME token comes from. Next post, I'll dig more into the forensics of the transactions from the genesis block and we will see how much they made. For now, I'd say this settles the entire debate on whether this coin was created by or used by FTX. That is unequivocal yes.",

    "selftext": "Matt Furlong, the $GME CEO, stated the following last August during earnings;\n\n **\"After spending a year strengthening our assortment, infrastructure, and tech capabilities, we're now focused on achieving profitability, launching proprietary products, leveraging our brand in new ways, and investing in our stores,\"** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to cover everything we already know about the above( increased product offerings immensely, two new distribution centers, new GME branded products, stock options for employees etc)\n\nFor the first time in 3 years GME's foot traffic is higher than pre pandemic ( as of October), and with the release of God of War, MW2, Pokemon Scarlett, increased PS5 inventory 400% YoY etc , and many others this coming Q4 is looking  pretty good( also notably GME's best cyclically  quarter because of the holidays) . See below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1yldxycrq0a1.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c98e941f1f6cf914c379e1a97453a42e69a9e805\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pokemon Scarlett Launch yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/ki2fvuu2rq0a1.jpg?width=1152&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d02527d5553dc842bb8857e064dcd2706fa18e2f)\n\n GME started a brand new offer new offering for its Pro member's recently; spend $200 and get a free NFT on their marketplace. Now before you blast this as some sort of gimmick; keep reading....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GME NFT promo](https://preview.redd.it/3r9v176htq0a1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d20b4fe6b3be2c1e6840f5e597aa334dfc05f21)\n\nGME not too long ago air dropped( sent out a free NFT) to the first 5000 users of their NFT marketplace. Those users received this [NFT pin](https://nft.gamestop.com/token/0x0c589fcd20f99a4a1fe031f50079cfc630015184/0x8a1967f5f93da038ad570a5244879031d010b8efa5c95eadcdf7df0f8cfbd25c). 80 ETH in trading volume currently, [650 ish sales](https://explorer.loopring.io/nft/0xdcf8ff6b4de163873066118a8eeec9e68c93e284-0-0x0c589fcd20f99a4a1fe031f50079cfc630015184-0x8a1967f5f93da038ad570a5244879031d010b8efa5c95eadcdf7df0f8cfbd25c-10), ranging from .245 to .09 ETH( $300 to $100 USD roughly).\n\nSo I don't know about you, but even my 6 year old son told me to buy $200 of product from GME, as it could potentially be 100% free in the end. Either way there is a chance for a decent size discount, as there is a large GME community that can't get in on the original promo( people overseas without local stores, or those who simply missed it etc). Also there are a lot of crypto speculators too. I've personally made 700% on my 7K investment into the GME marketplace so its definitely a place where you can make money. \n\nI believe GME will use this same incentive structure to gain more market dominance in both the video game &amp; collectable industry. For example if GME convinces Sony to sign up at their marketplace and offer an NFT collection, GME could bundle this collection as free incentive to those who purchase a God of War PS5 bundle through GME. This would give GME a huge edge over other competitors. Sony would be incentivized to become a creator here, as they would make a royalty on every NFT sale, and they already have a fleet of digital image designers etc, so it would take very little leg work. Furthermore, and more importantly Sony would then have access to every secondary customer's wallet address, and be able to offer direct coupons or other incentives to those secondary customer that they might never have contact with( through an air drop). It could reel in a lot more business for Sony. I was NEVER into crypto or NFTs before GME for example.  A lot of people simply will want to collect these Sony NFTS outside of monetary gains too. I have 150+ now, and some are just neat to have, just like all my Marvel cards when I was a kid in the 80/90s. I make lot of money, so its peanuts to me. My wife has 100K worth of american girl stuff, don't under estimate people's willingness to collect stuff; its human nature. Don't forget GME also gets a cut of each NFT transaction too, a double dip here on top of the original PS5 bundle sale. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce other businesses take note of this, many more will start reaching out to GME, and I believe GME will start basically selling their NFT marketplace services to other industries. Recently one of Liongate's partners did this for their new Saw Internet Game; [https://nft.gamestop.com/collection/saw](https://nft.gamestop.com/collection/saw) It will then importantly cross link with their marketplace, like IMX is doing with their video game NFT customers( video game developers). A centralized hub that will increase the liquidity drastically( necessary for an type of exchange to operate, and be profitable). GME has the customer basis for this, as they have noted is one of their largest assets.  \n\nSpeaking of IMX, they have now finally integrated with the GME NFT marketplace.\n\n[https://nft.gamestop.com/games](https://nft.gamestop.com/games)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[5 million worth of trades in the first week with only 6 game collections](https://preview.redd.it/m5abzdh41r0a1.jpg?width=679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee31d56042989356491679bb30a97b40dc1ccee5)\n\nThe owner of IMX; u/robbieimmutable mentions, \"\n\n \"More than half of these logos didn't exist 3 months ago.  Immutable is onboarding web3 games at a record pace in the middle of a bear market. \" \n\nAll of these games will be going on to the GME marketplace. IIRC something like 1000+ games are in the works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/indpjigk2r0a1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c609a985eb03a29a76edca09e23a8e9fa4bc0afc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sure out of 1000+ there will be something for every type of gamer. Furthering GME's bottom line, some of the NFT collections are cross useable between platforms, incentivizing even more trading. \n\n[Cyber crew and many other GME NFT collections are now doing this](https://twitter.com/CYBERCREWNFT/status/1592596400310980608?s=20). \n\n[Cyber crew in Kiraverse game](https://twitter.com/KiraverseNFT/status/1573069779832905731?s=20)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this combined with reducing store leases( 4573 down to 2963), and closing all stores in [Switzerland in Q1 2023( so not yet)](https://www.esports.ch/gamestop-plant-schliessung-aller-schweizer-filialen/), I expect GME to become profitable in the next 6 to 12 months. \n\nIn 3-4 more weeks we will know more on their Q3 earnings call. If they have reduced their cash burn rate from finishing their tech investments, its going to start to get spicy. Consecutive profitable earnings would be a first in 3 years I believe, and if all of the above works out; I foresee a lot of institutional buy ins. With the float mostly owned by retail who will not sell( as proven by [DRS](https://www.computershared.net/) 8-k sec filings) this is going to make the January sneeze not even registerable on the 5 year chart....  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have near 25,000 shares of GME at an average price around 35 per share post split.",

Shares are currently up 30% since my impressive analysis. \n\nThis is only the beginning my friends. You are obsessed with deep Fucking value yet you don\u2019t see it right in front of you. BABA is deep Fucking value. They have little debt and 1.7 trillion in Assets!!!!! 1.7 fucking trillion yet their market cap is only 200 billion. This is far better value then GME ever was. \n\n They have free cash flow of 25 fucking billion!! That means 25 billion in profit each year for the regards. If we take an ultimate bear approach and assume BABA stagnates for 10 years. Their profits alone will be worth over 100% of the current market cap. (25billion x 10 years= 250 billion)\n\nIt won\u2019t stagnate but even if it does, 10 years from now you\u2019d already have doubled your investment.  \n\nWe have multiple catalysts that will make BABA rocket even higher in coming months. They\u2019re currently being audited to avoid delisting. Once the audit comes back clear, the delisting risk will be completely eliminated. The auditing group recently came out saying things were going well. \n\nZero Covid will end. BABA is suppressed because Chinese economy is being shut down due to Covid. Let\u2019s be real. Covid pandemic is over. China will eventually end this silly policy. We\u2019re already seeing the easing of lockdowns. This is extremely obvious that zero Covid will end EVENTUALLY. Anyone with 2 brain cells will tell you this is a temporary policy and the market is pricing BABA like zero Covid will NEVER end. \n\nThe Chinese economy is the fastest growing economy in the world. BABA is the best way to capitalize on this extraordinary growth as it is one of the best businesses in China.\n\nBABA is an all in move at these levels. It\u2019s literally impossible to lose money on BABA within the next 5 years. Buy and hold for 5 years minimum and you are guaranteed to profit.

    "title": "I am a 3 billion dollar company who has a market cap of 3 billion. I will make 6 to 6.3 billion in profit for 2022. ZIM the gem!",
    "selftext": "I spent about 2 hours Thursday taking a long look at ZIM the finances, the cash flow, the stat of it\u2019s stock. This is because at the end of the month the recorded holders will get 2.95 per share on the first week of December. These are things you do if you really are long in the stock and ready to do proper DD.\n\nZIM has guided they will earn in profit 6 to 6.3 billion in profits for 2022. They will have sales near 13 billion. They have about 4 billion in cash. They have current liabilities of 2.8 billion \\[Due within 12 months\\] The past 3 months they generated 1.6 billion from business. They are giving out 354 million or 2.95 per share after earning 1.17 billion net. From the 1.6 billion generated they used 770 million in investments into their business. The same time last year they invested 182 million.. This is important for a couple of things. You know the investment, whether it be vessels, tech, another company will bring in future cash\u2026 As we know, the prices have come down in shipping and I already expect them to sell less and earn less. They are making 6 to 6.3 billion for 2022 and I expect them to earn 50% of that or 3-4 billion, that is priced in for me in the year 2023! 30% of that means they will give us near 10 dollars for HODLING. The board has authorized 30 percent of profits in the form of dividends. The financials are very strong, we know this! But the reason I wanted to deep dive is this!\n\n120 million shares of ZIM are outstanding\n\n30 million are owned by insiders\n\n10 million by Institutions\n\n80 million float\n\nTHERE ARE 15 MILLION SHARES SHORT or 18% of float\n\nLet us do simple math 15 x 25 that is 375 million dollars.\n\nZIM is giving 354 million dollars to shareholders for HODLING\n\nWhat I wanted to find out is why the company keeps giving us money instead of buybacks!\n\nThe cash position over the same time last year is down because of the investments for the future of the business\u2026. However, if the company wanted the stock to rise they can single handedly smoke the shorts and the stock would be 100+! This is a popularity contest! I just wanted to see the most recent data and see if they themselves were capable, forget an army of retail like Memes require! In fact 80 million shares x 25 dollars is 2 billion dollars. They just generated 1.6 billion from operating activity.. This means they can literally buy the entire float in under 6 months from the business running!\n\nIt is to bad I cant speak to the executives so we can raise shareholder value.\n\nDIVIDEND \u2013 Is made to honor shareholders for holding. It does not impact a share price not even 1%. 0! It is supposed to bring interest to your shares. It does not guarantee that people want the stock\u2026.. Earlier this week HRT announced a 100 million buyback and went up 25%! Check the chart!\n\nBUYBACK \u2013 It changes the supply, eating away the shares available \\[Float\\] It causes demand to sky rocket.. Many times if a trader has the confidence that the company has the financials to back a buyback they will also come to the store with their wallets\u2026 Who has better financials than ZIM ? Actually no one! There is not a company that has a 2.8 billion market cap that will make 6+ billion or .5PE.. I have never seen that. Yes, there tons of great financials in companies, but none have a PE ratio of .5! This is a relative figure. In my 28 years of trading when I see a company with a PE ratio of under 4-5 it means that the debt load, cash flows is horrible\u2026\n\nFor example.. A person with an amazing job, they make 250K a year\u2026 However, they have expenses of 300K a year.. So although a PE can be positive it doesn\u2019t mean at all! That the cash flows are positive\u2026 ..ZIM can literally buy all shorts with just 375 million or buy every single share available for 2 billion.. Which they have the ability if guided!\n\nA company wants to be public so they have access to cash whenever needed, so it isn\u2019t good for execs to go private\u2026Also, if a company needs loans they will even do convertible bonds, meaning they get money for free without directly printing shares.. I have never seen a strong company with positive cash flows like this disrespected with a .5 PE!!! That is why we go back to the start of todays briefing and we see gamblers anonymous\u2026.\n\nI understand sales will be down, because of shipping rates, I understand they will make less money, but they already will be giving you near $10 a share to HODL 30-40% of the stock price and have the power to buyback too! I would at minimum say it should be 60+ at minimum. I have 1,500 shares at 46 and even if the stock doesn\u2019t go up. They gave me 4.75 in September and about to give me 2.95 so that is 8 dollars to hold, lowering my avg to 38\u2026 But they can raise share price without the dividend if they want!\n\nLet us play a worst case scenario, and I would bet anyone in the world this doesn\u2019t happen\u2026\n\nLet us say they only make 1.2 billion.. Remember they have 120 million shares.. That is they make 10 dollars a share for the year. \\[Remember they just made 1.17 Net profit and generated 1.6 billion in 3 months!\\] but let us say 90% of workers at ZIM resign and don\u2019t work. \\[TWTR last night!\\] And they make 10 dollars a share. \\[Just made 9.66, in 3 months but we are speaking of the apocalypse\\] Remember their gross margin is near 50% so they earn almost 50 cents for 1 dollar in sales, so that would require them to go from 13 billion sales to have 2.4 billion sales in 1 year\u2026.. THEY WOULD GIVE YOU 3 DOLLARS TO HODL! 30% of 10! They have authorized a 30% dividend from profits! The stock is 25! That is 8.3% yield for just holding. Where else can you get 8% guaranteed! That is what I see, and why I am holding.. I wanted everyone to follow my logic and my thoughts\u2026.\n\nZIM has 80 million shares, AMC 520 and GME 310, remember the APES hold 80-90% of the float of these others.",

    "title": "GME is closing in on becoming a profitable company, and the 2 year chart will start reversing",
    "selftext": " \n\nMatt Furlong the $GME CEO, stated the following last August during earnings;\n\n**\"After spending a year strengthening our assortment, infrastructure, and tech capabilities, we're now focused on achieving profitability, launching proprietary products, leveraging our brand in new ways, and investing in our stores,\"**\n\nI'm not going to cover everything we already know about the above( increased product offerings immensely, two new distribution centers, new GME branded products, stock options for employees etc)\n\nFor the first time in 3 years GME's foot traffic is higher than pre pandemic ( as of October), and with the release of God of War, MW2, Pokemon Scarlett, increased PS5 inventory 400% YoY etc , and many others this coming Q4 is looking pretty good( also notably GME's best cyclically quarter because of the holidays) . See below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39i9xtnogb1a1.jpg?width=1378&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45ba9be740a4c2410b7d758d4a91962c5610366\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Pokemon launch last week](https://preview.redd.it/bv46a7tpgb1a1.jpg?width=1152&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ed6ffe601bf0dc0c08f4bb923727b188da8aaf)\n\nGME started a brand new offer new offering for its Pro member's recently; spend $200 and get a free NFT on their marketplace. Now before you blast this as some sort of gimmick; keep reading....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbtg3kv1lb1a1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78af7ad6453271e2724cc8f18818a7b2e3c09b6a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME not too long ago air dropped( sent out a free NFT) to the first 5000 users of their NFT marketplace. Those users received an NFT pin\n\n80+ ETH in trading volume currently, 650 ish sales, ranging from .245 to .09 ETH( $300 to $100 USD roughly). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4oyty0m2hb1a1.jpg?width=404&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c21a6c7bbc6c42ef1a5b3898018ba92d93c26f55\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I don't know about you, but even my 6 year old son told me to buy $200 from GME, as it could potentially be 100% free in the end. Either way there is a chance for a decent size discount, as there is a large GME community that can't get in on the original promo( people overseas without local stores, or those who simply missed it etc). Also there are a lot of crypto speculators too. I've personally made 700% on my 7K investment into the GME marketplace so its definitely a place where you can make money.\n\nI believe GME will use this same incentive structure to gain more market dominance in both the video game &amp; collectable industry. For example if GME convinces Sony to sign up at their marketplace and offer an NFT collection, GME could bundle this collection as free incentive to those who purchase a God of War PS5 bundle through GME. This would give GME a huge edge over other competitors. Sony would be incentivized to become a creator here, as they would make a royalty on every NFT sale, and they already have a fleet of digital image designers etc, so it would take very little leg work. Furthermore, and more importantly Sony would then have access to every secondary customer's wallet address, and be able to offer direct coupons or other incentives to those secondary customer that they might never have contact with. It could reel in a lot more business for Sony. I was NEVER into crypto or NFTs before GME for example. A lot of people simply will want to collect these Sony NFTS outside of monetary gains too. I have 150+ now, and some are just neat to have, just like all my Marvel cards when I was a kid in the 80/90s. I make lot of money, so its peanuts to me. My wife has 100K worth of american girl stuff, don't under estimate people's willingness to collect stuff; its human nature. Don't forget GME also gets a cut of each NFT transaction too, a double dip here on top of the original PS5 bundle sale.\n\nOnce other businesses take note of this, many more will start reaching out to GME, and I believe GME will start basically selling their NFT marketplace services to other industries; just like they did with the Saw Movie Game . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu2sgpxwkb1a1.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c109b96cc3990ca8d6d2988edf0dcbee9bbc0fa7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will then more importantly cross link with their marketplace, like IMX is doing with their video game NFT customers( video game developers). A centralized hub that will increase the liquidity drastically( necessary for an type of exchange to operate, and be profitable). GME has the customer basis for this, as they have noted is one of their largest assets.\n\nSpeaking of IMX, they have now finally integrated with the GME NFT marketplace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2ws0l56hb1a1.jpg?width=679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a41426f5fb5ad506718dbd2cd2404d5660224800\n\n5 million worth of trades in the first week with only 6 game collections\n\nThe owner of IMX mentions, \"\n\n\"More than half of these logos didn't exist 3 months ago. Immutable is onboarding web3 games at a record pace in the middle of a bear market. \"\n\nAll of these games will be going on to the GME marketplace. IIRC something like 1000+ games are in the works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thkmbf59hb1a1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4e66b3cb7fc4a6df7c16891ef4ebcb211314b69\n\nI am sure out of 1000+ there will be something for every type of gamer. Furthering GME's bottom line, some of the NFT collections are cross useable between platforms, incentivizing even more trading.\n\nCyber Crew and many other GME NFT collections are now doing this.\n\nAll of this combined with reducing store leases( 4573 down to 2963), and closing all stores in Switzerland in Q1 2023( so not yet), I expect GME to become profitable in the next 6 to 12 months.\n\nIn 3 ish more weeks we will know more on their Q3 earnings call. If they have reduced their cash burn rate from finishing their tech investments, its going to start to get spicy. Consecutive profitable earnings would be a first in 3 years I believe, and if all of the above works out; I foresee a lot of institutional buy ins. With the float mostly owned by retail who will not sell( as proven by DRS 8-k sec filings) the 2 year chart will finally reverse; just like it did for Tesla.",

    "title": "Noob question about Robinhoods '21 margin call",
    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand why RH got a 3.1B margin call from the NSCC and seem to be missing some basic knowledge, either on how the US securities system works or RH's margin system. Disclaimer: am not a US citizen so please bear with - looking to fill my gaps of knowledge. I hold a small GME position.\n\nFirst off, why is RH securities (what I understand to be RH group company) a member of the NSCC? If RH is sending their flow to hedgies for execution, shouldn't the hedgies be members of NSCC and not RH?\n\nSecondly, and related to the first point, RH is a broker-dealer who doesn't really deal but sends their flow to hedgies. Wouldn't this business model reduce their risk substantially (i.e RH hedges the market risk, they *only* have credit risk). Here i feel lies my missunderstanding. \n\nThe shares settle T+2. From what I know, in order to trade with RH (spot or margin) clients have to pre-fund their accounts, as in, you can trade only once your deposit clears (to be used for spot or as collateral). This should in turn mean that RH already has the funds to settle any trades, right? \n\nThirdly, come the GME longs, pushing the price up by retail buying call options. Call options are marginable, so if i were to buy options with RH, i'd have to post some margin collateral. In turn, RH would also have to post collateral to *it's counterparties* (the hedgies), and not the NSCC right? Seems not true based on my research.\n\nTo quote an article from Fortune, \"... *Specifically, brokerages like Robinhood might not have the capital to cover a potential collapse in prices between when shares were purchased on Wednesday and when they cleared two days later. In the same way a brokerage can ask an individual investor to pony up more cash to cover a margin call, the NSCC wanted Robinhood to plunk down more money to avert risk*...\"\n\nWhere would the capital insufficiency, mentioned above, come from, given that RH has already collected collateral from the client? And again, wouldn't the hedgies issue a margin call to RH, and not the NSCC? Finally, it seems that the issue exists only if the price plummets before the settlement. Why?\n\nHope my post is clear and that i'm asking the right questions - thanks all.",

    "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpdc1kpcek1a1.jpg?width=826&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5574f7a61b16aadf9358351ddcbfe7693e099b86\n\nRyan Cohen is a genuinely good human being - and definitely not a liar. \n\nThat is why he wont say that GME will be successful, he wont say it because he knows it would be a lie.\n\n Other CEOs with less scruples like Elon will say things like this:\n\n# Elon Musk Said In 2015 Tesla Could Be Worth $700 Billion In 2025 \u2014 Was 5 Years Early\n\nI am so grateful for Ryan Cohen, he is like a sexy little jungle Panda - and I know he will do the right thing and play everything safe ensuring that GME has some marginal gains after remaining relatively flat for a few years. Hey, the stock price may not appreciate at all. \n\nRyan Cohen is honest and if he doesn't have anything positive to say its probably because there is nothing positive. I appreciate that he does not want to be a \"meme stock king\" \n\n[From WSJ](https://preview.redd.it/amt4cj4nek1a1.png?width=2965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2bacfb58d9de1eb319d6e305617890067dbfd4c)\n\nRyan is a straight shooter - a man who loves dogs and children books. With Ryan you see what you get. That's why I don't appreciate people putting words in his mouth and insinuating that he is tweeting cryptic messages - RY-DOG don't play that. \n\nMy opinion is that a lot has changed in the last year and Ryan doesn't have any answers regarding the future of GME and that is why he remains silent.\n\nAs one person offering a perspective - I would wait for Ryan to actually say something viable and exciting before getting excited yourself.\n\n[RY-DOG and His Dog](https://preview.redd.it/78z76ngggk1a1.jpg?width=399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b8de25fe9548b5234801bb3ba4bd48ecff22c27)",

Smh - don\u2019t let emotions get to you.\n\n(Maybe RC was revealing they could be profitable this quarter and helping Icahn understand turnaround story almost complete)\n\nIf not OPEX then probably to offset any bullishness from the launch of the IOS GME wallet app today. My guess is it had like 1 million downloads in the first hour.\n\nWith the clear shorting today and many obligations due soon, I am soooo bullish on GME right now.\n\nLet\u2019s ride, merry OPEX and happy Turkey day everyone.",
