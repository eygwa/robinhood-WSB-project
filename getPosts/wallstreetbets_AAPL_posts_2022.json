    "title": "Is it different this time? A wider perspective.",
    "selftext": "While most of us believe stock market is extremely overvalued with many mini bubbles popping up everywhere, I just wanted to look at this a bit differently by introducing a historical perspective in terms of the companies that make up today's markets, technology, the wealth creation and generation and most importantly the flow of money into goods and services.\n\nI wasn't old enough to grasp the dot-com crash back in early 2000's and while I do remember '08 crash pretty well, it took me many years to understand the underlying drivers of it. Over the years I tried to expand my knowledge of the markets and always tried to look at things from an historical perspective especially at those periods when markets were down/flat/didn't go anywhere for years or decades. With that perspective, what I want to try here is to use the benefit of hindsight, but not to state the obvious, but rather, state how things turned out in reality vs expectations at the time.\n\nListening to Warren Buffett's older speeches, one of the things he mentions often was that how American society thought they would be taken over by Japan in terms of technological advancement back in the late 70's and early 80's and that there was not enough optimism with respect to American innovation that could prevail its leadership going into the following decades. While obviously not the only factor, this lack of optimism was apparently evident in markets and there were many years when not much was happening.\n\nIt is actually fascinating to observe that over the coming years, the exact opposite has happened. Introduction of computer in the 60's in the west coast - perhaps much earlier than most of the world - the creation of Silicon Valley and emergence of big-tech are more than just happenstance. I am not an American. While i will not go too further deep into this topic here, my personal view is this all goes back to foundations of the country and the fact that there is no cultural baggage/deeply embedded subconscious that prevents things from happening on this side world. Perhaps the big reason for this is the change in behavior/consciousness of people who emigrated here and were able to drop the burdens of the past.\n\nIf you think about the wealth currently possessed in our world, most of it was perhaps created/generated in the last 50-100 years (perhaps even 20-30 years). You might have been born somewhere with rich history (as I was), your forefathers and the empires that they have built could have ruled the world for hundreds or thousands of years and conquered every corner of the world, but none of that matters now. It's as if millions of years of history is almost irrelevant at this point because you were either able to adapt things in the past few decades or you were not. What I am obviously talking about here is the new creation of wealth as the existing wealth matters less and less each day. One of the reasons for this is obviously the fact that the world has not seen a \"reset\" since World War 2. It is perhaps the first time in history when we had such prolonged peace.\n\nLet's think for a second the implications of globalization in this peace period. This is perhaps the first time in history where the world is so connected that even the products we use on a daily basis are the same. Imagine the flow of goods and services 50 years ago or even 25 years ago. Were you able to access goods and services overseas this easily? Where would your disposable income be spent on? Even 25 years ago local markets did matter for the most part. I'd watch local TV, buy local newspaper, only a handful people had cellphones, internet was still nascent, most of the appliances in your home were already a commodity. If you had disposable income, most of the money would be circulated within the local economy and the most expensive things would be the house you'd buy (that obviously does not change today) and a car which would benefit a few countries but not a single one (perhaps Germany for the most part). So all in all, there was no single country that the money was flowing into. This was not possible by design.\n\nI am not saying all this goes away now. But thinking for a second, isn't this really the first time that a significant portion of disposable income, wherever you are in the world, flows into one single country? And for economies in which this does not happen, do they really matter to the global wealth in grand scheme of things?\n\nTake Europe or Middle East for instance, amazing blend of many cultures, languages. The entire world once was ruled from Mesopotamia, then Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Rome and so on. Are they relevant anymore? What does a beloved country of Italy contribute to world economy these days? France? Spain? UK? South East Asia? - amazing corners of the world, billions of lovely people. Do they matter from a wealth creation and flow of money perspective? Of course they do, but to what extent if you think about end products: goods and services. What do they actually produce that the entire world consumes/needs? Of course Middle East has oil. But oil is a raw material and the goods and services used by this wealth creation does not necessarily change - the cars they buy, the planes they fly, the services they use are not locally produced. Take Saudi Arabia, a total GDP about $800 billion with all the oil. Apple generated $366 billion revenues in the last twelve months.\n\nLet's expand upon this.\n\nLet's assume you wake up in the corner of the world and don't have survival problem. What you do or spend your time is not significantly different than us here in the US. Your homepage is google for everything, you use whatsapp to talk to your friends, you are on instagram, your business uses outlook/microsoft, your phone is samsung/apple/android, you log into youtube on a daily basis, you prefer to watch netflix over local TV. (Sure, China is different from this aspect but it is also the reason why they have been outpacing everywhere else in terms of economic growth. They were not stupid about this and realized the effects of globalization early on).\n\nNow, you might be thinking - dude that is only such a small portion of the world. Millions of people don't even have access to any of those. I am well aware of that and while it is correct for the most part, from an \"overall wealth creation perspective\", billions of people actually don't matter all. It may sound so harsh, but think about the many countries of the world with millions of population and realize that their total GDP is less than the cash sitting idle on Berkshire Hathaway balance sheet.\n\nOr think of this perspective: What would happen if their disposable income was magically 10x tomorrow? What goods and services would they spend their money on? Is it really the local goods and services that would benefit from the overall increase in GDP - of course to a great extent - or is it really a handful of companies in the world that would actually benefit disproportionately from this wealth increase when that happens? If everybody in India could afford iPhones would they buy something else instead? Or would they be able to produce a competing good or a service locally that the entire world would consume? Would the money really flow elsewhere?\n\nOr are they really late in the game anyway, as we already argued that in the wealth creation game only the most recent period matters.\n\nSince the dot-com bubble era, I'd argue that a lot of things have changed. It is interesting because dot-com bubble was the classic innovation pattern - people knew internet was the next big thing but it was not exactly clear who the winners in the next decades would be. 20 years since, we know who the winners are. We know what business models work, what business models can scale, have network effects and become profitable and so on. Horses vs cars was another classical example. You did not have to be a genius to realize cars would take over horses but time was harsh to many car companies in that there was no one single winner. It was by design of the product it became commoditized. Same can be argued for air travel. Internet however is different. While new business models emerge, consolidation and monopolistic effects are far more real - it's a world where big becomes bigger as it employs smartest people, outbids competition, and constantly innovates.\n\nOf course there is no guarantee this will go on like this. After all, if you look at top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 for each of the past several decades, you will see interesting results. How will the next big thing overthrow the existing giants when big always get bigger, especially when they benefit from the overall wealth increase in every corner of the world? Perhaps a new technology or maybe a catastrophe can trigger this. While I'd never want to guess the future, I am inclined to think as long as the status-quo peace continues, certain companies in the world  - as they keep their innovative pace - will continue to dominate.\n\nIs the market expensive? It sure is. But what will happen tomorrow if GOOG, AAPL, AMZN drop by 20%? Wouldn't people rush to put their entire wealth the next day? Sure multiples can contract. But is a 25bps/50bps move in rates going to destroy these companies? Would it make them worth less? Yes discounted cash flows should be lower and they may be growing 15% instead of 20%. But 5 years from now, are we going to see something similar to dot-com bubble where things don't recover?\n\nBut where else can the money go when your disposable income will be spent on that next iPhone, or half your time is spent on instagram/whatsapp/youtube/google, your businesses will still use Microsoft and its products and that will probably not change anytime soon. These are important as indices are market-cap weighted indices. So we would need a correction in big-tech more than anything else. And even if they do change, from which corner of the world is the next big thing going to emerge? \n\nNone of this is against the argument that the markets will not correct. However, I do not think the examples of dot-com era or 08' are justified. I think something \"bigger\" than 25bps increase in rates is needed for US markets to crash and stay at those levels for longer periods of time. This is again based on my reasoning that there is a wider fundamental shift in how we live and consume in comparison to past. And I did not even go into the demographic change here which is a totally different animal on its own.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading.",

And even if they do change, from which corner of the world is the next big thing going to emerge? \n\nNone of this is against the argument that the markets will not correct. However, I do not think the examples of dot-com era or 08' are justified. I think something \"bigger\" than 25bps increase in rates is needed for US markets to crash and stay at those levels for longer periods of time. This is again based on my reasoning that there is a wider fundamental shift in how we live and consume in comparison to past. And I did not even go into the demographic change here which is a totally different animal on its own.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading.",

At press time, U.S. stock futures were lower, with the Nasdaq futures down 1.44%, the S&amp;P 500 futures down 0.87% and the Dow futures down 0.69%.\n\nGoldman Sachs, \"Flag Bearer of the Commodity Bull Market,\" Remains Steadfast in its Bullish View for a Decade\n\nJeff Currie, head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, discusses some of the key themes that could shape commodity prices in the coming decades, and once again reiterates his view that he has been bullish on commodities markets for the past year. Not long ago, the bank reportedly said it was \"extremely bullish\" on commodities and sees a possible decade-long supercycle.\n\nDanske Bank: Fed expected to raise rates 4 times this year, start tapering in September\n\nIf the U.S. economy develops in line with expectations, the Fed may raise interest rates for the first time in March, supported by a tight labor market and still-high inflation. The number of Fed rate hikes this year is expected to increase from three to four (in March, June, September and December, respectively), with each hike of 25 basis points. In addition, it is expected to start tapering in September. Given the strong economy and higher underlying inflation, we believe the risk of tightening tends to increase rather than decrease.\n\nBank of America Survey: Investors reduce net position in technology sector to lowest level since December 2008\n\nBank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey for January showed that fund managers' net allocations to the technology sector fell 20% sequentially to 1%, the lowest level since 2008. They expect inflation levels to fall this year and are betting on a record overall boom in commodities and equities. In addition, a monthly survey conducted by Deutsche Bank found that most respondents believe U.S. technology stocks are in a bubble, as investors remain very pessimistic about the Fed's hawkish turn and rising U.S. bond yields.\n\nHot News\n\nStar Tech Stocks Weak in Pre-Market, Nvidia, Tesla Down More Than 2%\n\nAs of writing, $Nvidia ([NVDA.US](https://nvda.us/))$ and $Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ are down over 2% premarket, while $Meta Platforms ([FB.US](https://fb.us/))$, $Amazon ([AMZN.US](https://amzn.us/))$, $Microsoft ([MSFT.US](https://msft.us/))$, $Apple ([AAPL.US](https://aapl.us/))$ and $Google-A ([GOOGL.US](https://googl.us/))$ are down over 1%.\n\nAnti-epidemic stocks lower in pre-market, BioNTech down more than 6%\n\nAs of press time, $BioNTech ([BNTX.US](https://bntx.us/))$ is down over 6% premarket, $Moderna ([MRNA.US](https://mrna.us/))$, $Novavax Pharmaceuticals ([NVAX.US](https://nvax.us/))$, $Ocugen ([OCGN.US](https://ocgn.us/))$ are down over 3%, and $Pfizer ([PFE.US](https://pfe.us/))$ is down nearly 1%.\n\nGoldman Sachs$ Q4 net revenue of $12.64 billion, down more than 4% pre-market\n\n$ Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://gs.us/))$ reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $12.64 billion, fourth-quarter investment banking revenue of $3.6 billion, fourth-quarter trading revenue of $3.99 billion, fourth-quarter equity sales and trading revenue of $2.12 billion, and fourth-quarter fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities sales and trading revenue of $1.86 billion.

Pindo said, because the page display percentage digit is limited, so they put a percentage with at least 6 digits or more after the decimal point, omitted to show as 0.9%, the 0.9% shown on the bargain page is not 0.9%, but 0.9996427%. For the lawyer invited more than one person to chop but the chopping progress bar did not change, Tang Jiangrong, senior director of Poundland's legal department, explained: \"Because some of the free chopped goods amount is large, pulling a small number of users to chop off the amount is not enough to make the percentage change, it will make consumers think that the chopping price has not changed.\n\nAzure's U.S. subsidiary is reported to have recently signed a ten-year lease for an office building in San Jose, California, doubling the footprint of its headquarters compared to the current one, with nearly 18,580 square meters of office space after the expansion.

So it might be the best time to steal from thetagang.\n\nThat said, I think we'll see two types of tech ER scenarios going forward. Type 1 will be a $NFLX repeat, taking everyone by surprise.

Elon is currently also down on gambling with company funds on \ud83c\udf3d, but its probably not gonna be significant enough of a loss. \n\nI preface this that anyone betting against Elon is already bankrupt, but I think this could be a type 1, given that there is a chance for guidance and growth expectations to be lowered. They will probably still beat earnings for the quarter though, as they beat their delivery goals. Downside is that puts will be expensive and only pay out on a large enough move.\n\nThen there also Intel reporting on Wednesday, $INTC is a boomer shit stock that likes to drop on earnings as well. P/E is currently at 10 though. The current market seems to punish high P/E companies more than low P/E companies. While we wouldn't expect much growth with a P/E this low, at 10 we could also say that Intel is a value stock currently and there's better tech stocks to go short on.\n\nServiceNow ($NOW) also is one of these P/E high flyers. Trailing P/E of 90.99 (so averaged over 12 months). Based on the last ER some sites report as high as a 466.29 P/E, but obviously that may be wildly off if their earnings are a bit more seasonal. But I've seen forward estimates over 100 as well. They have a product for companies for tracking and managing business procedures. I haven't used it but seems it overall NOW seems to track and correlate a lot with SPY.  \n\n**Thursday - $AAPL, $HOOD, $V, $TEAM**\n\n\n\n$AAPL - P/E ratio 28 and EPS in healthy uptrend. Q4 is also a really strong quarter for them usually. Not enough conviction to go long on this one yet, on the other hand I also wouldn't short it. But its likely going to be a Type 2. If it drops some more, BTFD might be a good idea.\n\n$HOOD seems like the obvious short, given that they are losing money left and right. But they are already down 80% from their highs so I think there might be not enough meat on the bone left. Maybe it even squeezes, if they can guide higher due to higher Q1 volatility. If thats what makes them earn more money. It's still an absolute POS stock. If it goes up after ER, that would be a good time to short it.\n\n$V - P/E 36.60\n\nVisa is down 11% from a July 2021 ATH. Financial companies have been under pressure for some time. For me a boomer company, not likely to have an outsized earnings reaction, but who knows maybe this was the non obvious one to go down.\n\n$TEAM - Trailing P/E 187.9. Down 38% from ATH.\n\nThis might fit the bill for a bloated company that got boosted by WFH and covid. Maybe there's still some downside left if the report is bad. Atlassian is mostly known for the dev/wiki like platform everyone hates, Confluence.\n\nDisclaimer: I have no positions in any of the mentioned companies at this time. Should $AAPL and/or $MSFT go down more before ER, I might think about going long shares/calls. For a lotto ticket I'd go with $TSLA OTM puts, still not sure if I really want to bet against Elon and will do more DD. $TEAM and $NOW could also be candidates for going short.\n\nEdit: added $TEAM and $NOW to the list.\n\nTook no positions.\n\nHow the predictions turned out so far:\n\nMSFT up | was up nicely next day\n\nTSLA down |  ~~flat AH~~ down next day\n\nNOW down | +10% next day\n\nINTC maybe slightly down | ~~slightly down AH~~ down next day\n\nAAPL up | up AH\n\nHOOD no idea, maybe squeeze | ~~down~~ squeeze next day\n\nV no idea | nicely up next day\n\nTEAM down | up AH, up next day",

We will likely bounce here and there but yes, I am calling a  major correction/recession.\n\nSpent 2 hours on this to show how fked we are - rates may be eyeballed as I referenced bar graphs\n\n**TLDR: Fed's basically BRRRR'd and left the overnight/interest rates at rock bottom lows (opps?) creating the biggest asset bubble we have ever seen in the entire history of mankind and mind-numbing inflation.**\n\n[SPY monthly chart - with commentary](https://invst.ly/x6shz)\n\n[SPY monthly - 1974 - Jan 2022 \\(48 years\\)](https://preview.redd.it/j80ngysj5dd81.jpg?width=1858&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc040dd32a9b4ee7b5ef6730f0f24fb09cdf550)\n\nEV bubble:  TSLA and EV is probably the biggest bubble from what I can tell and Elon managed to sell the top. EV cars is like gas cars back then but never commanded a huge P/E. Cars are utility, goes A-B. When people see through that self driving tech is a decade away (prob due to city infrastructure to support self-driving and political red tape \\[nobody is rushing to have a self-driving car\\]), we can see some downside or relatively flatness or bearish on it.\n\nReal estate - bubble.... everywhere... Cheap money borrowed from the Feds. Canada's YOY RE prices has gone up 27%. There is no supply issue because we had this supply issue pre-pandemic but we never popped 27% in a single year or even close to it. People are balls deep in mortgage payments, and those who got in late is even more screwed.\n\nmetaVerse - a pandemic by product - too early to tell how to monetize this space. You can tell companies have been doing this, CS GO - skins, Diablo 3 - marketplace. These have not taken off in any dramatic way so we can gauge consumer sentiment to spend money in a virtual reality.\n\nAI innovations- this would be deflation.\n\nSPY top holdings are BIG TECH. Big tech was the major theme of the pandemic hedge which ended up being great winners. Re-opening is a negative for all these companies and the pandemic is basically over after this year.\n\nThe thing trading at 35k right now. This that have no value, is speculation. Speculation ends up being a bubble. EVEN if this thing is the next best thing, we are too early. All this cheap money finding new ideas to generate an ungodly P/L is basically, a matter bubble.\n\nWarren Buffett - ATH cash holdings. Going to wait out for the market to kick out the froth.\n\nChina - Imposing tons of new regulations to soften their markets, whether it be RE market (tax on developers), big tech (listing and fines, all regulations), ensuring the COMMON prosperity can continue (most China markets are/were already inflated before this initiative was introduced). China is basically a step ahead of the US Feds in controlling their economic cycles.\n\nRead this, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp), then reflect on life around you, then read it again.

    "title": "Rate hikes and how it affects stocks - Watching for FED (GRRR...no more BRRR)",
    "selftext": " Lets do a simple analysis here.\n\nTake the popular stock AAPL - PE is \\~28 at current price $163. Investors were willing to pay up to $182 for 1 share of this company at low interest rates environment. PE at 182 would have been \\~32. In other words earnings per 1$ of investment here would yield 1/32 = 3.125%. Now lets assume interest rates goes up one percentage due to FED hike. Its natural this causes a ripple effect in way banks lend, finance, bond markets etc...naturally investors will demand 1% more return from stocks as well (this is for debate I know). So lets say investors want 4.125% now, which would equate to PE of 1/.04125 = \\~24. Hence prices would need to come down by 25% (24/32) from ATH to make this feasible which equates to $136. Now lets say AAPL has 5% earnings growth (projection is actually less from analysts for 2022 - source Schwab), price would go up to 136\\*1.05 = $143 by end of 2022.....2023 with another 1% rate hike and similar growth...it would go down further, unless earnings blow past expectations.\n\nUsing the same method we can say SPY would get to $360 by end of year due to rate adjustment, with 10% earnings growth, this could get to 396. Nasdaq is another story probably worse, as there are high PE speculative stocks as part of that as well.\n\nSample reference for PE vs interest rates: [https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-understanding-the-relationship-between-rates-and-p-e-ratios](https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-understanding-the-relationship-between-rates-and-p-e-ratios)\n\nNow, big investors expecting this, would naturally collect profits and move to stable dividend stocks (SCHD, Energy etc) is my guess. Since big money moves, this could be worse than what it actually should be, due to panic selling......\n\n**Tldr: end of year SPY target is $370....could be slow bleed. My play is to keep watching and add money to funds and attractive stocks (MSFT, CRM...) as it goes lower. I am here for 25+ year horizon...so can withstand some years of pain. Look at 2000, it took slow bleeding....and 13 years to get back to ATH SPY price, but with DCA this may not look that bad.**\n\nI may be wrong completely IF THE RATE HIKES WERE PRICED IN TO $480 ATH prices, which I really doubt given the way the markets are reacting. **Also, balance sheet tapering is not considered above. Worst case SPY could go to low 300's or upper 200's, based on few other analysis I did, best case if retail keeps pumping the dip, could get to low 400's.**\n\nLooking for feedback here in terms of the following below (no emotions please, I am simply trying to analyze here):\n\n\\--&gt; assumptions on interest rate rise vs stock returns - provide alternative argument if you don't agree\n\n\\--&gt; how do we know if markets priced in rate hikes...even if it did...balance sheet tapering was not...how to account for that? how much more PE should come down...?\n\n\\--&gt; if you are bullish with SPY getting to $480 and above, please provide alternative thesis other than market being irrational, because its not...",

After they are done emaciating Amazon and Netflix, they will (at the very least) attempt to repeat their success with an attack on Apple, Facebook/Metaverse and Google. Why?

    "selftext": "Yo, granny's back bitches.\n\nSo yesterday when the market went red cause the Zuck got cucked, my original post was bombarded with bear comments saying how wrong I was and how you f\\*gs are shoving dicks into my mouth cause I'm holding SPY and QQQ call positions that are **ITM** and doesn't even expire till **NEXT YEAR**.\n\nAll I'm going to say in response is this:\n\n\"*aww, did you wait until a wed day befowe acting cocky? Did it make you fweel special? Did you think the bear mawket is here becwause an alien CEO didn't beat estimates?\"*\n\nYeah, didn't think so.\n\nLook, you bears need to learn how to read the room. Take a look at this graph right here:\n\n[https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-november-5-2021](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-november-5-2021)\n\nyeah, thats right. 92% of information technology companies beat estimates last quarter. What part of this screams bear market to you? Hmmm? When you look at this chart, what make you think tech stocks are honestly going to 0?\n\nLike how does your logic even work? Is it something like this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\\*MSFT beats earnings and raises guidance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: doesn't count  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*AAPL crushes earnings and raises guidance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: I didn't see that  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*AMD crushes expectations and raise guidance  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*GOOG reports stellar earnings and issues 20:1 split  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: FAAAAKE NEWS  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*FB beats revenue but misses EPS by 17 cents with guidance just below lower range for next quarter  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bears: we ride at dawn, bitches!!\n\nAnyways, like I said before, since you are all clearly a bunch of mentally handicapped dotes, I'm willing to bet 90% of you **FUCKING DOUBLED DOWN** on your short term puts instead of cashing out like you should have done. Now looking at the charts, its clear you are getting sodomized by the delta while vega gang skull fucks you to death with the IV crush all the while theta gang sits in the corner, films the whole thing while touching himself.\n\nHonestly, if you bears are willing give up so much wealth, so quickly, you might as well join those communists on r/antiwork.\n\nI mean, what are you waiting for? You're already poor, starving, radical, the only thing left for you is to try to seize the means of production.\n\nTo wrap this up, I better see some hefty loss porn next week you hoes.\n\nGranny out.\n\n*\\*hops on mobility scooter*\n\nOh wait, I forgot\n\n*\\*spits on your face again*\n\n*\\*hops back on scooter and zooms back to retirement home.*\n\n**Edit 1:** The fact that I'm getting awards but only sitting on 4 upvotes really shows me how triggered you bears are.

    "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/hMrRqrj](https://imgur.com/a/hMrRqrj)\n\nBest asymmetric play in the market right now.\n\nReduction in users is problematic and the loss of revenue from AAPL's privacy changes introduces headwinds, but the rout that FB has taken these past two days  suggests that there will be no way to manage either of these two issues. Today's dump is a continuation from yesterday, largely based on the negative news articles about how yesterday's loss was the worst in financial history. Basically, FB's loss yesterday was overdone, and today's drop is hysteria.\n\nFB will not get to ATH over the next two weeks, but I do expect it will approach previous support levels (roughly $300). Even if it gets to the mid-zone between the two previous resistance zones ($275, between $300 support in 2021 and $255 support in 2020), then the 2/18 $245 call shown above will still yield a 5x.\n\nThe news cycle next week for FB will be \"FB mounts rally after facing worst daily loss in financial history\". It may only regain a third to a half of the $323 to $234 loss, but even this puts us at a share price of $265... which would be a 4x on the 2/18 $245 call.\n\nHonestly, I think this play is a 5 bagger in the next two weeks. A run back to $325 would make me $1,400,000.\n\nEDIT: After being down 30% and up 28% at various points through the day, I ended up flat. See you next week!\n\nEDIT 2: Whelp, this went about as well as I deserved. Sold an hour before close on 2/11 for an 85% loss.",

    "selftext": "Position: NVDA $265x10 Call Feb18\n\nEarnings date: Feb 16 \n\nAlright, here's a play even the most dim witted of you can follow. If any of you have been paying any attention to the GPU and graphics cards market you'd have realized one thing by now. You're shit out of luck if you want to buy a graphics card in the current market - they've been sold out for quite a while now and if you want to buy 1 then be ready to shell out $3k-$4k.. There's even a Japanese retailer selling these babies, the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500. That's right, let that sink in. These bad boys are selling for 3x the MSRP and NVIDIA is set to launch the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, you guessed it, right before earnings.

Coupled with the fact that virgin gamers around the world are ravenous to get their hands on one of these bad boys when the new lot is out guarantees it will be sold out instantly. \n\nDon't believe me? Okay believe the smart money then: One of the world\u2019s largest public pensions by assets made major changes in its investments in large-cap tech stocks as 2021 came to a close.

    "title": "TSLA and a tale of two boomers",
    "selftext": "Sharing my general investment thesis because I think looking at history gives a unique perspective that many people glance past when they\u2019re diving deep into the weeds. For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. \n\n**Introduction** \n\nI know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let\u2019s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).\n\nBefore we go comparing apples to oranges I\u2019d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.\n\nApple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won\u2019t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won\u2019t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the\\_massive\\_fud\\_campaign\\_against\\_apples\\_iphone/](https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the_massive_fud_campaign_against_apples_iphone/) \n\n**Competition is Coming**\n\nIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png) \n\nWe can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they\u2019d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven\u2019t perfected a single one yet (see Chevy Bolt). \n\nIn 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that \u201cThey\u2019re still catching up with the first iPhone we\u2019ve moved beyond that\u201d. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases. [https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/](https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/) \n\nAnother year or so goes by and the industry realizes that Apple isn\u2019t just in the phone business but that they are also in the software business. They adjust their strategy with a reactive instead of proactive approach again to continue playing catchup. Notice that they finally included a touchscreen after claiming nobody wants one, and also attempted to do music/apps/etc. Legacy auto is currently at this stage now where they haven't really completed the first step of making nice EV's but are hyping up software buzzwords. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png) \n\n**A Cult of Personality**\n\nIn terms of the product ecosystem Apple has been noted as having a cult following of people who evangelize their products. This cult of personality has also rippled from their notably eccentric CEO Steve Jobs throughout pop-culture and through their retail investor community. We know that Wall Street hates unpredictability and likes things which are easy to analyze and fit into a certain category. \n\nTesla clearly mirrors this wild cult-like behavior from top to bottom, and arguably to an even greater extreme given Musk\u2019s social media behavior. Both of these companies have been known for being the red-headed stepchild of Wall Street due to always thinking and behaving outside the box.\n\n**A Tale of Two Boomers**\n\nMany people say hindsight is usually 20/20 however I\u2019d like to offer unique example of attempting to hone the skill of foresight. To present this I will offer a tale of two boomers I\u2019m fortunate enough to know, followed up by a personal experience of mine.\n\nMeet Bob, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to watch CNBC and talks about movement in the DOW in terms of points instead of percentages. One of the coolest family members of mine, great guy with an interesting story. \n\nBob purchased $AAPL in 1993 for around $14 ($0.31 split adjusted) and sold it around 6 months later for $19 per share ($0.42 split adjusted) which was a modest gain for holding under a year. Obviously we can see that if he would have just held he\u2019d be laughing all the way to the bank. However he is your average retail investor that buys random stock in random companies he doesn\u2019t fully understand and hasn\u2019t ever done enough research to develop the conviction to hodl.\n\nMeet Mike, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to play guitar and go fishing. His first job out of college in the early 1980\u2019s would fly him around for work and he randomly got upgraded to first class free one day on a nearly empty flight heading from San Francisco to LA. He struck up conversation with two guys named Steve and Steve who thought he may have been wealthy since he was in first class and tried to pitch him on investing in their computer company named after a fruit. Yes that\u2019s right it was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\u2026 He politely declined as he was broke and just recently graduated from college, yet reminisces of the pleasant conversation they had that day.\n\nSeveral years later he ended up getting an Apple IIC desktop computer and reflected on his conversation on that flight while he enjoyed using his new computer at work. Over the next few years he began to slowly pick up a few shares of Apple stock as he could afford to but he never had a huge disposable income as he was raising a family and working an average job. Over the next 10yrs through the ups and downs he continued slowly buying because he kept enjoying their new products. Many years have since gone by and his small position has grown into a sizable one which enabled him to achieve waterfront living in South Florida and early retirement. \n\nAbout 2 years ago Mike purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance and when I asked him how he liked it he instantly began raving about how amazing it is. He also mentioned how it reminded him of when he got his Apple IIC back in the day. Mike even stated to me that he believes Tesla is on a similar path to the one Apple took and that he began converting some of his AAPL holding to begin accumulating TSLA after he got acquainted with the product.\n\n**Muh P/E Ratio**\n\nOne of the common things people say when analyzing a growth company is \u201cThe P/E ratio is too high\u201d. P/E looks backwards at old earnings which is what should be used if you\u2019re evaluating a boomer company with cashflows that aren\u2019t growing much.  \n\nBy looking backwards instead of forward everything will look overpriced because you aren\u2019t factoring in future earnings growth. Looking at only the P/E ratio has caused many people to miss out on the best growth stories of all time. Remember the articles when AMZN had a P/E of 1200 a few years ago? Bet you wish you bought then\u2026\n\nForward P/E ratio and PEG ratio are the two metrics you should be using. I promised this post wouldn\u2019t be about numbers so do a quick google search on these sometime. \n\nMaybe do some research on TSLA\u2019s operating leverage and gross margins if you really want to dive deep ;) \n\nOnce you understand Forward P/E and PEG ratio you\u2019ll see that TSLA is currently undervalued. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMany people have done great work on DCF models and attempting to value Tesla, but I believe that other factors are hard to forecast when looking further past a 5 year time horizon. I think that things will continue to surprise people and disruptive innovation is extremely difficult to quantify. \n\nMy general thesis is that TSLA in 2022 is similar to AAPLin 2009 but with a waaayyyyyy larger TAM, curious to see how things play out :)\n\nPositions: Literally all in on TSLA June 2023 $1000C's, January 2024 $1000C's and January 2024 $1200C's",

    "title": "If You Cannot Beat Them, Join Them - Congress Trading &amp; Retail Traders",
    "selftext": "Just wrote a blog post at [Tradytics](https://tradytics.com) and thought it's worth sharing here to let retail know what's going on.\n\n2021 was a great year for the market as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  rallied about 25%, which is significantly more than its average yearly  return. Many traders made money, but there was one group that made more  than most of us, and that was the group of US politicians. In 2012, the [STOCK ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)  was introduced to prevent the members of congress from using any  insider information to make trades, and require them to report their  trades within 45 days.\n\nWe are not sure how much is the rule followed these days by the members  of congress, but what we have seen over the last few years is how well  members of congress have been doing [extremely well](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/)  in terms of their performance in the markets. This could either be just  a coincidence, or they have more information than an average Joe.  Whatever the case is, the purpose of this post is to help retail traders  follow the congress trades to also earn profits like them.\n\n## Congress Trades\n\nSince the STOCK ACT requires the members of congress to report their  trades within 45 days, we want to find a way we can  leverage those trades to find some edge in the markets. As soon as a new  trade by one of the members of congress is reported, we publish it in our [Congress Market Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-market) shown below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h8rtk99wig81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e51c5f81c661c86a30c88466de8495d93de2d06\n\nThis is every single trade that gets reported - one way we can think  about leveraging them is by simply taking the same trade. However, there  are a couple of issues there. First, not all members of the congress  outperform the market indices every year, only a few do. Second, these  trades are delayed by upto 45 days. Sometimes, the stock might have  already made a big move when they are reported, we want to be careful of  that. Finally, different amounts of money are spent on these trades,  and we want to weight them accordingly. The screenshot below shows the  top trades made by congressmen and women - millions of dollars going  into a trade should signify that these people are very confident in  their trades, and we should be okay in following them. Keeping these  limitations in mind, we try to solve them and end up with a solution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr1g8bjawig81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc86ed2285efa280d2150ce35de73d9c40735e5\n\n## Congress ETF\n\nLooking at the historical data, we came up with a few observations.  First, many congress trades have a long time period i.e congressmen and  women do not enter into trades and exit immediately. This fixes the  issue of the 45 day delay although it does impact us somewhat in case  the stock has already made a big move before the report. Second, there  are many smaller trades and it is hard to use them well. When  significant money is being put into a trade, we want to weigh it more,  as it provides us more confidence. Finally, we want to be able to update  our picks as new data comes in. Based on these three observations, we  developed what we call a [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf) that combines congress trades in an intelligent manner and outperforms SPY.\n\nAt every day, the congress ETF takes the top 100 trades based on  their value and assigns them weights proportional to the amount that  went into the trade. The weights of the symbols are considered their  allocation, and it changes every day as new trades come in. Sold  positions are automatically removed from the ETF once they are reported.  Based on this dynamic allocation of symbols, we construct an ETF called  Congress ETF. Before diving into more details, let us first take a look  at the performance of the ETF and compare it to SPY.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5wuo8tbwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3bf4d88e81dd63240369cb6745e87b17c50934\n\nLooking at the chart above, we can see that the Congress ETF outperforms [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) by a factor of 2, which means it's twice as good as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY). If you've traded for a while, you would know that beating the markets i.e [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  is not an easy job, especially on a consistent basis. Now that we've  seen the performance, the question you as readers would have is how can  you actually use the ETF to earn money.\n\n## How do I follow Congress ETF?\n\nIn our [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf),  we keep a chart that shows the allocation of each symbol in the  portfolio. All trades are long trades, and the chart on average updates  every 1-2 weeks, since not many large trades are frequently made by the  congressmen and women. For instance, an example allocation could be MSFT  (40%) and AAPL (60%) which would mean if you have a 1000 dollars, you  should buy shares worth 400 dollars for Microsoft and worth 600 for  Apple. The chart below shows the allocation of symbols over time. There  are about 47 symbols in the ETF right now, but if that is a large number  for you, you can also pick up the top 10 symbols based on their bar  size in the chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxvoro4dwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2efc1622e322d365ca220f5d51c487f92bf189ab\n\nIf you look at the allocation chart, you can see how each new bar  comes after a week or two. That's because very large trades are rarely  made by politicians's, but whenever they are, we pick them right away,  and readjust the ETF. In future, we might automate and allow you to  simply do one click and put a fixed amount of money in the entire ETF.  But right now, the process is somewhat tedious and manual.\n\n## Congressmen &amp; Women ETF\n\nAs we discussed, the Congress ETF at the time of writing this  contains about 47 symbols, which can sometimes be too much to follow for  a retail user. In order to fix that, we also allow users to analyze  individual congressmen and women's portfolios. We employ a similar  process as described earlier on the construct the ETF, but on average,  there are at most 5-10 names in every politician's portfolio, making it  easy for retail traders to follow. But which members of the congress  should we follow? That's a good question and needs answering first.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8qgcn9ewig81.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f58a30d311f644be9b130c4fc13651cec7ad17\n\nThe chart above shows the average performance of each traded taken by  the best performing congressmen and women. If you've read the news  lately, it is no surprise to see the great Nancy Pelosi in there,  because she did quite well [last year](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/).  These are the people that we want to follow. Now let us take a look at  Nancy's portfolio and see how easy it is at Tradytics to follow her  trades.\n\n## Nancy Pelosi ETF\n\nIn order to get the dashboard for individual members of congress, you can head over to our [Individual Congress Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual).  The default search is already for Nancy Pelosi, so we will dive right  into her portfolio. The figure below shows her ETF performance, symbol  allocation, and the times when readjustments were made to the portfolio.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z9bs9ifwig81.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995e3c0b2f430147f6dbae3212e4f0834dffc6b6\n\nLooking at the screenshot above, the first thing to note is that  although the congress ETF beat SPY by about 2x, the Nancy ETF actually  beat it by 2.6x which shows how good she has been trading lately. The  more important graph is the lower one that shows the allocation of each  symbol in her portfolio at every day the readjustments were made. In  contrast to the congress ETF, there are only about 10-11 symbols in her  portfolio and she only made new trades about a dozen times in the last  year, which is very manageable for retail traders as well. It is easy  for us to keep an eye on her positions in the [dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual) and follow them whenever they are reported.\n\n## Limitations &amp; Final Thoughts\n\nMost people believe that the 45 day delay in reporting causes some  limitations in trying to follow congress trades. As discussed earlier,  that is obviously true to some extent but retail traders can still  follow positions even after that delay, and still be able to earn  similar profits as the members of congress. If you go ahead and take a  look at the trades tables in the dashboards, you will actually see that  many of the positions had not moved much before they were reported to  the public. That is also a criteria that you can use to follow trades -  only go into the ones that haven't moved much at the time of reporting.  Despite some of the limitations, we believe Congress trading is a good  source of generating alpha in the markets and can help retail traders  find an edge. As always, please always do your due diligence before  going into a trade, stay safe, and manage risk. Thank you for reading.",

It has a P/E of 16, a 4:1 asset/liability ratio, 65% YoY **increase** in cash flow, and currently trades at 15x FCF. $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN, $GOOG, and $TSLA have a P/E of 25-188 (lol), higher debt ratios, lower margins (FB gross margin is 80%), and trade at 27-272x FCF (guess who's at 272)\n3. Weekly (and daily) RSI are the most oversold they've been since the post-IPO dump, and the weekly is curling to put in a bottom \n4. It bounced off the May 2018 and Feb 2020 high today, delicious\n5. The VWAP is $220.78, so easily in reach\n6. Option flows are primarily being driven by Jan 2023 calls being sold, but IV is also in the 83rd percentile, so expect those to be closed out as IV decreases\n7. The current level also shows a successful test of the -2.618 Fib retrace from the September 2021 dump, with the -3 at $201. For reference, it peaked at 3 Fibs on the nose from the March 2020 crash\n8. The weekly 200 &amp; monthly 50 MA sit right at $230, so closing successfully above that willtake it to $266 and eventually $290 to attempt a gap fill\n9. The aforementioned MAs just happen to be right above the 2018/2020 trend, at $228.56\n\nThis is a great spot to dip a toe in, with a stop below $200. If we get a weekly then monthly close over $230, the party is back on.\n\n**TL;DR:** The Metadump can easily become a Metapump if we clear $230 \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15. If this works out, you can send me donations. If it craters, I'll obviously delete my rambling \ud83d\ude1c\n\n**Bonus**: Zucc can buy SPOT &amp; PTON for $45 billion (Black Mirror, anyone?), and still have enough for a super-yacht bigger than Jeff Amazon's + 300 000 metric **fucktons** of cocaine to make these hoes dance. Oh and he'll get $5 billion in cash minus transaction costs from the acquisitions, and be back at $50 billion in cash in a year",

For the other jobs, just half ass it and see how long you last. It'll take at least 3 months before they fire you if you aren't a complete idiot. You should then take the salaries from the non-main jobs and put them entirely in AAPL 200c expiring January 20 2023. Why?

    "selftext": "It is probably evident that there has been slaughter left and right for meme stocks, tech, and anything growth related. I am not here to rant on why tesla is obviously over-valued and how fundamentals don't mean shit to some of these stocks (I have Tesla calls, don't punish me).  \n\n\n#  1 Timeline\n\nAnytime between now and the market crashes, cool, isn't that what every stupid bear ever said. Let's just buy a shit ton of leaps and pray. No. It is much easier than that. The play i am trying to explain is a 6 month to 1 year timeframe. This gives the market enough time to slowly bleed and adjust to interest rate hikes, war nonsense, inflation, and balance sheet reduction.  \n\n\n# 2 Catalysts\n\n Everyone says \"But stonks only go up\", \"These are down %50-%70 from ATH\". I am not looking at companies like $PYPL, $SQ which have fundamentals and make money. I am looking at companies that have no free cash flow, bad technicals, and make no money. Some of these have already came down a lot, but they have a long ways to go. With interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction it will be extremely difficult for overvalued companies to get bonds and loans to increase their production or operations. How might this affect bigger companies that are not neccessarily overvalued, rather, blue chip growth stocks like GOOG and AAPL. They will certainly go down in the next 6 months to 1 year but will recover and hit more ATH in the near future. So stop buying puts on big tech and wondering why they won't react as bad as some others.   \n\n\n# 3 The Play\n\n**Lucid Motors, Rivian, Draft Kings, Beyond Meat are all trash can water and belong behind Wendy's with the rest of you retards buying OTM 0DTE on margin**  \n\n\nHow the hell is LCID a 20 billion dollar company, Rivian twice that size, and how is Beyond Meat still a public company.   \n\n\nTo the people who say they made bank 2020-2021 on these, congrats your calls printed but we are moving on with this rotation. There will not be anymore meme relevance or squeezes for these stocks. Look at how much they have already came down from ATH. There is so much more room to go down, it is obvious these can EASILY decrease %50 more. Remember when [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) was public and going crazy in 1999? Yeah it got delisted after the first bubble pop. THIS IS EXACLTY what is going to happen to some of these companies this year, and people cannot fathom how it will happen, because it will happen when we are not ready for it  \n\n\n# 4 The bubble\n\n It is clear stocks are in a massive bubble based on their Price to Sale (P/S valuation). \n\nWarren Buffett  stated that his favorite means of valuing stock was the stock market capitalization to GDP ratio.\n\nBelow is a chart for this metric. As you can see, the stock market today is as overvalued relative to the economy as it was at the peak of the 1999 Tech Mania.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0pvdtigpmj81.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376c74db877985f3878fab9ad2081981abc07816\n\n So stocks are overvalued based on the most reliable corporate data point (revenues) and they are also overvalued relative to the economy. Scratch that, they're not overvalued... they're **trading at 1999-Tech Bubble insanity levels**. \n\nThis time the FED has created a **bubble in everything**. A \"risk-free rate\" of return against which ALL risk assets are valued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparing to 1999 tech bubble, 2008 housing market bubble, this will be considered the 2022 Digitial Currency/EV bubble. Look at the 10-20 year charts for any automotive company. It is not pretty. So what makes Rivian and LCID worth more than GM or Toyota? Nothing, since its a bubble. I will rule out Tesla on this one since we know damn well they make money, have an incredible CEO, and produce something tangible unlike these others. Tesla is still overvalued and it will go down with the digital currency/ev crash, but most likely not as hard as other competitors.   \n\n\n# 5 Short Bull thesis counterargument\n\n*\"What if it takes 3 more years to crash these sectors? Look at Tesla in 2016, 2017, 2018 retard, you thought it was overvalued then, look how high it is now.\"*   \nGood point, but that's what a bubble is, and the government allowed companies to become overvalued by constantly printing money and rising inflation since before the pandemic so stocks could only go up and create this bubble we are currently in.   \n\n\n*\"How can you be so sure these will keep dropping?\"*  \nA stock can never hit 0 but can become pennies. Look at WISH, CLOV, and those aren't even penny stocks yet, or delisted, but a lot lower from what their overvalued price was WITHOUT interest rate hikes, and balance sheet reduction. We can be sure many of these will be delisted or go to single digits. I will explain which ones below  \n\n\n6 Positions  \nMostly playing monthly to year puts to reduce Theta decay and try to let them expire when the market will most likely feel the change the most. Trying to not go so far OTM in case we see more short-term bull runs, as often these occur in bear markets as well. Tesla is more of a gamble since 250 seems incredibly unlikely, but so did most of the stocks in 2000 (DELL $60 to $2)  \n\n\n**4-6 months out:**\n\nRIVN June 17 2022 40P  \nLCID June 17 2022 20P  \nBYND June 17 40P\n\n**Longer dates**  \n\n\nLCID Jan 20 2023 10P, 12.5P   \nLICD Jan 19 2024 10P  \nRIVN Jan 20 2023 30P  \nRIVN Jan 19 2024 30P  \nTSLA Jan 19 2024 250P  \nBYND Jan 20 2023, 30P",

    "selftext": "Alright, idiots, listen up. Green energy is back on the menu. Sure, you could make boomer gains with oil or things that go boom right now, but why the fuck would you want to do that when you could be Oprah rich from some bits of glass that make the electricity that charges your wife\u2019s robot boyfriend\u2019s batteries? She\u2019s living in the future, so should you. \n\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with some bullshit ~~stock bro astrology~~ technical analysis. Because I\u2019m too fucking stupid to understand any of that anyway. Instead I\u2019m going to hit you with some basic math. \n\n\nA month ago, JinkoSolar IPO\u2019d a subsidiary on the Shanghai exchange. They listed 42% of the company and it\u2019s got a market cap and enterprise value both of +/- $18 billion USD. JKS has a market cap, today, of only $2.1 billion on the NYSE. \n\n\nNow, I\u2019m no mathemagician but that doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense. How does a company \u201cworth\u201d $2.1 billion own 58% of *another* company \u201cworth\u201d $18 billion? It doesn\u2019t make sense at all, right? Now, because stocks only go up, I see three outcomes here:\n\n\n**SCENARIO 1: Easy Gains**\n\nJKS owns 58% of a company worth $18 billion. Their stake is worth $10.4 billion, give or take. Their own market cap should be 4-5x what it is today, putting them at $200-250 a share. \n\n\n**SCENARIO 2:** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nSo we all agree stocks only go up, right? Good. And I think we can all agree that valuations are made up and the technicals don\u2019t matter. Perfect. In that case JKS owns 58% of a company worth $18 billion, and if we value JKS at the same as their Shanghai subsidiary, *plus* the fact that they actually own that company, JKS is up to $420.69 share. More like $400, but why let your dreams be memes right?\n\n\n**SCENARIO 3: I\u2019m a fucking idiot**\n\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, this is a real possibility. Get your June 17 $20 puts while they\u2019re cheap. \n\n\n\n\n**BONUS SCENARIO**\n\n\nThis one\u2019s for the idiots in the back even dumber than me. JKS has a small float, and 69% of the total shares held by insiders and institutions (nice). As of January 31, there were 4 million shares sold short, up from 3.4 million at the end of December. If this starts to run, you can all piss and shit about a sHoRt SqUeEzE for old time\u2019s sake. JKS $900 is not a meme.^((it probably is, though\\)) Here\u2019s some more rocket emojis for you degenerate apes: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n**TLDR:** JKS is undervalued based on their Shanghai subsidiary\u2019s market cap alone. Easy money. Can\u2019t go tits up. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Unless I\u2019m a complete fucking idiot, which is entirely possible. \n\n\n\nPositions: 42 JKS at $51.58 because i\u2019m not fucking with options and i\u2019m kind of a little bitch so I don\u2019t want to go all-in. Although it does represent my entire USD trading account, which is my fuckit savings that isn\u2019t in boomer ETF\u2019s and AAPL. \n\n\n**EDIT BONUS SCENARIO 2: Enterprise Value Boogaloo**\n\n\nJKS has an enterprise value of $6.22 billion, $7.04 billion in cash, and a per-share book value of $229.14. *Literally* cannot go tits up. Just based on enterprise value, JKS is worth $150 a share because I passed middle school math classes and know that 6.22 / 2.1 \u2248 basically 3, and 3 x 50 = 150. Checkmate, past me who said I\u2019d never need math out in the real world.",

Because China will be attacking Taiwan in the upcoming weeks/ months I think they will have a different approach to attacking them then Russia has when attacking Ukraine. I think while military invasion will probably still happen I think it will be more of a relentless amount of cyber attacks that will devastate the little island nation causing there production to cease all together for a few weeks minimum. \n\nAAPL heavily realize on there exports to make there phones this should cripple there stock and tesla may also get hurt as well along with Intel. \n\nWe are looking at a most likely non nuclear ww3 folks I mean it's not out of the question for a few nukes to be exchanged here and there but the three main ways of battle will be fake information campaigns, hacking and drone strikes/missle strikes.

    "selftext": "Ten months ago, u/robertisaak proposed, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naehn4/south_park_investment_theory/) on wsb, using a portfolio derived from South Park episodes. He promised to return with a graph but never did. I took it upon myself to continue his research. \n\nWhile the show definitely had its tenbaggers, I assumed that the good calls on Build A Bear Workshop, Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Sony ($SONY), Amazon ($AMZN) were just lucky, and, all-in-all, the performance should be roughly on par with an index (let's say S&amp;P500, as it uses the same acronym). \n\nI did however decide to look deeper into it, and to my surprise, a very simple South Park Index^[1] drastically outperforms S&amp;P.\n\nThis is how they actually compare:  [2009-2022 graph \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80](https://i.imgur.com/VhUObvd.jpg). \n\nA different comparison showing how good our South Park predictions are is the following: consider you buy a stock mentioned in an episode during that day and keep it for a month, respectively a year - how does the performance compare to buying $SPY on that day? Average returns:\n\n* **1 month hold**: South Park Stock: 5.93% \ud83d\ude80 vs S&amp;P 0.93%\n* **1 year hold**: South Park Stock: 35.42% \ud83d\ude80 vs S&amp;P 11.86%\n\nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future performance and this approach has some small biases^[2], the numbers make it quite clear that South Park has been a really good stock selector. But why is that? You could argue that the publicity that it brought helped, but it's definitely too small of an impact for the large-cap stocks (i.e. AAPL, AMZN). Most likely it's just the fact that the episodes tend to focus on things disrupting &amp; impacting our society, those things that change the way we do things ($TSLA, $AAPL, $TWTR), those we love ($SONY) and those we hate ($AMZN). Buying such companies at an early time is a good way to make a strong return (especially in a long Bull Market).\n\nSo, should you buy the next stock mentioned? Maybe, probably. \n!!This is not financial advice!!\n \n\n[1] The index is an **equal-weighted** combo of all stocks mentioned in episodes in the previous 18 months, and they are \n\n[2] Mainly survivor bias\n\nMore detailed info on data preparation, biases, portfolio construction &amp; rebalancing in my yt on this: https://youtu.be/8CRYaVEQD-4\n\n\n**Later Edit:** By popular demand, here's how the same index construction (except this time position is set the next trading day, as Simpsons airs on Sundays) would perform for **The Simpsons** [2009-2022 Graph](https://i.imgur.com/dTb05BF.jpg). Still better than S&amp;P500, but way worse than South Park. \nThe recent loss is due to positions in $UBER (Mar 2020), $NFLX (Jan 2021), and $RACE (Jan 2022).",

    "selftext": "My as\\*. SPY goes to $500 in 6 months.\n\nNo one wants to put their money in a high-inflation environment for a measly 2% bond return when inflation is 20%. Stock market is the only place to go now (and may be housing?).\n\nIn the long run, inflation +20% implies that AAPL most likely will +20% too. If you think they will still selling an iPad for $329 in one year, then you don't know what inflation means. Higher inflation means higher price for everything, including tech items. Big tech companies will brrr both with and without money printer.\n\nDividend stocks will also perform well during high-inflation period (next 2 years at least), so we may just pick up some VZ shares while it is still low.\n\nCompanies that are not yet in profit? Well, these are the companies that may stay low for some period of time.\n\nThe Fed starts QT soon? Yeah, the stock market will fall, but we have mid-term election coming during end of this year. I don't think Biden will allow JPow performs large-scale QT beforehand, so the effect will be minimum.\n\nTldr; Bears are f\\*cked.

AMZN, +2.56%,  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -0.15%   GOOG, +0.30% Google, Apple Inc.  AAPL, +0.50% and others oppose the proposed legislation, saying it would make it harder to offer popular services. The bills\u2019 opponents also say it is fair for e-marketplaces, search engines and app stores to profit off their creations\u2019 popularity.\n\nThe department\u2019s letter throws its weight behind a different view: that the platforms\u2019 dominant position gives them unchecked power to influence the fate of other businesses, and that restricting the platforms\u2019 conduct would carry significant benefits.\n\n\u201cDiscriminatory conduct by dominant platforms can sap the rewards from other innovators and entrepreneurs, reducing the incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d the letter says.\n\n[Read more](https://www.wsj.com/articles/doj-backs-antitrust-bill-targeting-amazon-google-apple-11648519385?mod=mktw&amp;mod=article_inline&amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D06728681253105368730235018188473878888%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1648541656)",

    "selftext": "First off, I'm not a financial advisor, I am an absolute idiot. \n\nSo, this isn't going to be the best DD in the world, but I think it offers a pretty significant correlation between the $AAPL Daily chart that is referenced in the Result vs Effort Model that Richard Wyckoff taught. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/44ri3xqfs9r81.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3baa5854b72f61080ea4cf5699b92a9666fd1ac6\n\nWhat we are expecting here, is one last spike in volume on the decline, before a significant increase in value. I'm predicting it to get into the low 900's, maybe 800's again one last time before value incentive really kicks in to take this baby beyond the stratosphere. \n\nNot to mention, Elon is splitting the stock because it is currently over bought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Wyckoff Price Cycle Visual](https://preview.redd.it/vt4js75ps9r81.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a276aa9a7b62cb95c2d92d1ef24a5244344dfcbd)\n\nThe reason for Elon's stock split is to level out the growth of his company, creating more supply so the demand can continue to rise at a healthy rate. I believe this markdown (one more dip with a volume spike) will occur before the stock split in order to prepare $TSLA to be transferred into its new, healthier and more fruitful soil. \n\nIf there is anything I may have gotten wrong, please share your opinions with me. \n\nEnjoy your happy meal",

BABA, JD, etc. I feel  like they could totally revisit mid march lows if this continues.\n\nAnyone making any moves on this situation? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npositions: 100 shares AAPL. nothing in anything else I mentioned.",

    "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Not financial advice. Manage risk.\n\nGoing to do another full DD since the last one I did was in December and we've learned a lot since then to say the very least\n\nIf you're going to click off or say something because of FUD I encourage you to read the FUD section first before responding to save us all some time of reading your old debunked information.\n\n# The Basics\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at\n\n* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial\n* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+\n* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.) - MxM app (Don  junior's new app, merger unconfirmed)\n* Possibly other general webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.), not going to talk much about this in this DD, something to watch for in the future. See agreement with Rumble\n\nAgreement with Rumble (~~32~~  45m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.\n\n# SPAC Structure\n\n$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M / 193.4M (shares post merger) **\\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at \\~$48 a share the current marketcap is priced in at \\~9.6B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ej6aby395t81.jpg?width=729&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7736963bc0de81800eff4a846aa61929a8fa8a64\n\nThe PIPE funding is the largest in history and will provide them with about $1B plus $300M from DWAC's trust. We'll talk more about the PIPE and potential investors later\n\n# Basic Sector Understanding\n\nCompared to its competitors Truthsocial has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a \\~3x-5x the current share price of \\~$48, $162-216 a share.\n\nNow let's take a look at the competitors\n\nIn October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement\n\nFB Marketcap: 910B\n\nTWTR Marketcap: 50B\n\nPINS Marketcap: 34B\n\nSNAP Marketcap: 85B\n\nNFLX Marketcap: 295B\n\nPresent day\n\nFB Marketcap: 528B\n\nTWTR Marketcap: 26B\n\nPINS Marketcap: 14.5B\n\nSNAP: 46B\n\nNFLX 150B\n\nThis translates into\n\nFB: -42%\n\nTWTR: -52%\n\nPINS: -57%\n\nSNAP: -54%\n\nNFLX - 49%\n\nCompare this to the Nasdaq\n\nQQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021\n\nWhat this means is these companies should of only collectively lost\n\nFB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B\n\nInstead they have lost\n\nFB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B\n\nThis a net difference of\n\nFB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B\n\nFor a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.\n\nWhere is this money going?\n\nDWAC + 14B\n\nAAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B\n\nThere's a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)\n\nI'm guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG's competition has presented itself.\n\nMy latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It's too small a float, even post merger. It's also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it's a SPAC and hasn't filed an S4 yet.\n\n# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors\n\nI'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America's Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.\n\nNetflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)\n\nDisney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nHulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nDiscovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers\n\nNetflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.\n\nLet's say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.\n\nLet's say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \\~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.\n\nTranslating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's move forward to the Social Media aspect\n\nFacebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nYoutube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nTiktok \\~1B users, \\~400B marketcap, \\~$400/user\n\nSnapchat \\~347MAU \\~ 58B marketcap \\~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)\n\nTwitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \\~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)\n\nYou can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \\~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)\n\nI'm going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I'll get into I'm going to put this at 193 for now\n\nThis would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**\n\nLet's talk about the news aspect of the business model.\n\nFox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump's rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.\n\nDon Junior is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it's getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.\n\nWho knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.\n\n# Key Performance Indicators\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qb8ie84595t81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f99d561af3dd32b979dfbadd759c1e60c3f9cbb\n\nHere's a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings\n\nThese numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.\n\nTS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)\n\nFrom the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)\n\nTracking Trump's followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \\~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.\n\nExtrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways\n\nThe current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding\n\nHowever this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure\n\nUsing a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump's Follower's Growth Report 3-21\n\n13262e\\^(0.175\\*365.25)\n\nIt says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)\n\nLets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial\n\n671.52x\\^2+7553.7x+9074.4\n\nThat says\n\n92M per a year, and that's with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.\n\nUsing the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)\n\nAlso noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth\n\nOf course we'll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.\n\nThe big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I'm guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks\n\nFor some comparisons\n\nPath to 1M users\n\nTumblr 27 months\n\nTwitter 24 months\n\nPinterest 20 months\n\nFacebook 10 months\n\nDropbox 7 months\n\nSpotify 5 months\n\nInstagram 3 months\n\nTruthsocial 1 month\n\nI have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren't using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble's infrastructure\n\n# Lets talk about Profit Margins\n\nTruthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.\n\nFirst let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet\n\nStarting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\\_Twitter\\_Annual\\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)\n\nWe can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue\n\n1.37B Cost revenue\n\n873M in 'Research and development'\n\n888M in 'Sales and marketing'\n\n562M in 'general and administrative'\n\nTwitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.\n\nLet's break this down again\n\nTwitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent\n\n37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.\n\n23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)\n\n24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.\n\n15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.\n\n3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.\n\n29% on taxes.\n\nYes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.\n\nWhy is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?\n\nLets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)\n\nPage 57\n\nGoing to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU)\n\nCost of Revenue : 266 M (\\~330M inflation adjusted)\n\nResearch and Development.(R&amp;D): 593M (\\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\\~160M inflation adjusted)\n\n2011: \\~100M MAU\n\nCost of Revenue: 62M (\\~85M inflation adjusted)\n\nR&amp;D: 80M (\\~110M inflation adjusted)\n\nSales and marketing 26M (\\~36M inflation adjusted)\n\nGeneral and administrative 233M (\\~310M inflation adjusted)\n\nOk so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users\n\n2020: \\~330M MAU\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$4.15 per monthly active user\n\nR&amp;D: \\~$2.65 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$1.47 per monthly active user\n\nR&amp;D: \\~$3.29 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$1.78 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.71 per monthly active user\n\n2011: \\~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nR&amp;D: \\~$1.10 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$0.36 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nSo what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.\n\nLet's recap\n\nCost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**\n\nR&amp;D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**\n\nSales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**\n\nAnd general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**\n\nLet's see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)\n\nPage 64\n\n2021: FB 2.91B MAU (2,910M monthly active users)\n\n(CoR) Cost of revenue: 22.6B -

This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.\n\nThis is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.\n\nIt would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.\n\nIn other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.\n\n# Lets Talk Share Price\n\nSo currently the markets are priced at \\~72 a share would would translate to something like\n\n40M TS users ($40) + 8M TMTG+ subs ($25) + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.16), \\~ $69\n\nYou can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already\n\nHere's a potential scenario\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nMore scenarios\n\n600M TS users (\\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement\n\nA total blow out of just one of the aspects\n\n1B TS users (\\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**\n\nAnother example\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nImagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**\n\n# DWAC 1000\n\nwith much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.\n\n1.5B TS users (\\~1/2 of facebook) ($1500) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \\~**$2000 a share**\n\n3B TS users (\\~1/2 of facebook) ($3000) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \\~**$3414 a share**\n\n3B TS users (\\~entire market) ($3000) + 250M (entire market) TMTG+ subs ($775)  + Above Fox Audience ($400)  = \\~**$4200 a share** along way to go to get there\n\n# Who else is bullish\n\nKevin O'Leary from shark tank has said this is \"going to work\" search of O'Leary DWAC.\n\nSpeculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true\n\n# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp\n\nThere's been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list\n\n\\~4M in SI and \\~1M in FTD. At least. It's also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \\~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the Short to Liquidity Pool ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, Days to Cover Ratio \\~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \\~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as &gt;300% at some points.\n\nThere is massive gamma ramping in danger of happening on call options and float evaporation potential. I won't get into it more here and now, check post history and google search maxpain dwac\n\n# FUD\n\n**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**\n\nI know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.\n\n**FUD:** \"People won't want to advertise there\"\n\n**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality\n\n&gt;Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don't come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented \"less than 20%\" of total ad revenue.\ud83d\udcf7The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors\"Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients,\" said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. \"They're definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"I think it's relatively unlikely that small businesses \\[and\\] small brands will join the boycott, because they're the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers,\" Perrin said.\n\nCNN's website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html\n\n**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. \"Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities\" \"\n\n**FUD:** \"\\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.\"\\*\n\n**Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post \"The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger\" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \\*\\*\"\\*\\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline \" and \" The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors.\"\n\n**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful\n\n**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn't understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)\n\n**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan\n\n**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,\n\n**FUD:** \"Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email\"\n\n**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gga6xbf895t81.jpg?width=1361&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ac72e87543a5f39f77664c4a134d5e3dda3cf5\n\nThere's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services\n\nAlso Lmao, linkedIn etc. FUD is nonsense, these guys are under NDA and are in the top 1 percentile of talent, networks not bound to these nonsense companies are not the sole arbiters of resources\n\n**FUD:** \"This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure\"\n\n**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe . Also it's likely Apple and TMTG have a deal since it seems everything is an Apple exclusive at first and their marketcap has been doing well (see that section in the above DD)\n\n&gt;**What Happened:** According to a [Variety](https://www.benzinga.com/)report citing data from the analytics firm **Conviva**, **World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.'s**\u00a0(NYSE:[WWE](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WWE#NYSE)) **WrestleMania 38** drew a combined 2.2 billion impressions across all social media platforms in its April 9-10 presentation, whereas the **NFL\u2019s Super Bowl LVI** brought in 1.8 billion impressions on Feb. 13.\n\n[https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=41](https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=41)\n\n[https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW\\_CE?t=1291](https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW_CE?t=1291)\n\n[https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW\\_CE?t=309](https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW_CE?t=309)\n\n[https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=86](https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=86)\n\n&gt;Everyone wants to know what is on Truthsocial, it is the digital platform for the entire reformed republican party with the midterms coming up. It is highly relevant in the culture war and the reimplantation of fair meritocracy based content (that is aside from politics) the removal of shadow banning, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. There has never been an agreed centralized effort for everyone to regroup. It doesn't become relevant until traction is there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rumble Reports added 9M users QoQ , 22% QoQ\n\n**FUD:** \"Trump steaks\"\n\n**Counter:** Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.\n\n*The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.*\n\n**FUD:** \"Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology\"\n\n**Counter:** I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.\n\n**FUD:** \"Open source\" \"Bad security\" \"Software licensing\"\n\n**Counter:** Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in. Rumor of Thiel involvement (he was raising money for campaigning with DJT junior recently)  I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir is involved in some way for security.\n\nI'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.\n\n**FUD**\n\nDrop in downloads etc.\n\n**Counter**\n\nIt's in load test phase, and still the fastest growing platform in history. Do your own research, fake news would have you buy Twitter right now while it's about to get clapped.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO\n\nI have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once more hard data rolls in (in the coming weeks), if not then by the time the revenue rolls in.  The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n# Inverse Cramer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Not financial advice.

    "selftext": "**TLDR;** $IPOF is being speculated as the company that will take Starlink public and the insane options OI could result in a **GAG (Gamma of All Gamma\u2019s) that would make $IPOF rally massively due to 90K contracts across the chain sufficiently ITM. It currently sits with the 3rd highest gamma score in the entire market and shares at NAV are a RiskFreeTrade\u2122. Not financial advice.**\n\nHello tards, looks like people are shitposting DD again \\*cough\\* Weeber Grills \\*cough\\*, so if you\u2019re falling for those bullshit posts I do feel sorry for you. Especially because most of you don\u2019t know how to read! Today I want to talk about a RiskFreeTrade\u2122, $IPOF, the beloved holding from Scamath Chapalapitya. It does meet the rules and market cap for this sub so stop complaining if you already are. **Lots of info in this DD is speculation, some facts based, and other\u2026 not so much.** I have also been tracking this stock for several weeks now, watching the ITM OI continuously grow. What **is** true is that $IPOF has the technical setup for an explosive gamma rally fueled by massive ITM OI that already exists on the chain.\n\nI repeat, the ITM OI already exists on the chain. This DD is not financial advice, I am not telling anyone to buy anything, and in fact, if NONE of you buy anything, this OPEX day could still lead to a massive gamma rally. I am merely sharing a setup that looks extremely promising and profitable. I will keep this short and sweet so you don\u2019t go back to jacking off in your basements.\n\n**Wen Starlink?**\n\nNow as I mentioned, this is just pure speculation from my partially autistic savant big brain. I will be using a children\u2019s book and other sources to defend this thesis. Links and facts have been \u201cborrowed\u201d from u/kallis .\n\n**1)**[ \\[2021-Nov-30\\] SpaceX's starship engine crisis is creating a risk of bankruptcy](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-to-spacex-starships-raptor-engine-crisis-risks-bankruptcy.html)\n\nIn the article, see the section on *Starship crucial to Starlink\u2019s financial success*. This section indicates that the V1 Starlink satellites are *financially weak* and that the V2 satellites are *strong*, which can only be launched effectively by Starship. Starship itself is very important to the financial stability of Starlink. Effectively, SpaceX needs much more funding beyond private equity to continue expanding the Starlink \u201cdivision\u201d..\n\n**2)**[ \\[2021-Feb-10\\] Musk eyes Starlink IPO when cash flows are predictable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/spacexs-starlink-accepting-99-preorders-as-musk-considers-ipo.html)\n\nStarlink now has 250K users ([reference](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/02/14/starlink-hits-250000-customers-elon-musk-hints-spacex-booking-over-300-millionyear/?sh=3f950c257063), as of 2022-Feb-14) with \\~$300M in revenue per year.\n\n**3)**[ \\[2020-Sep-28\\] Musk wants retail investors to get priority for Starlink IPO](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310672832783884290?s=20&amp;t=Q2motOG7OlzdYuSf6c3Wqg)\n\nThe tweet says it all and the best way for retail investors to get involved is via SPACs.\n\n**4)** [\\[2022-Feb-18\\] Chamath steps down from Virgin Galactic (SPCE) board.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/chamath-palihapitiya-steps-down-from-virgin-galactic-board.html)\n\nChamath[ sold all his SPCE stake](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chamath-palihapitiya-sells-virgin-galactic-spce-stake.html) and stepped down from Virgin Galactic board to *focus on other existing and upcoming board responsibilities*. He has since joined the board of Palmetto ([reference](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/palmetto/people)) and also[ serves on the board/advisor of 17 other companies](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/chamath-palihapitiya) (as of 2022-Apr-08). It is not very clear why he would step down from Virgin Galactic board, unless there is a conflict of interest with a future board responsibility.\n\n**5)** [ \\[2021-Mar-01\\] *Green Eggs &amp; SPAC* by Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1366514542939828224?lang=en)\n\nThis is somewhat indicative of Musk warming to the idea of SPACs. This is highly speculative, but may also be a reference to[ Green Eggs and Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham), where at the end Sam warms up to the meal.\n\n**How does this information link a Scamath SPAC ($IPOF) &amp; Starlink?**\n\nSpaceX and by proxy, Starlink, need additional funds to continue their programs relatively soon, so going public by a non-traditional method would raise cash the fastest. We know that Elon wants to prioritize retail investment, and a SPAC allows for this rather than an IPO which can gatekeep against the average investor due to pre-IPO purchasing.\n\nChamath stepped down from Virgin Galactic which could indicate avoiding conflict of interest in case he serves on the Starlink board. Social Capital, which Chamath is the CEO of, invested in Swarm, which was sold to SpaceX ([link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/spacex-acquiring-satellite-data-start-up-swarm-technologies.html)). This would further link the two companies.\n\n**Why anytime soon?**\n\nAgain speculative, but the podcast Chamath does called The All In Podcast, keeps hinting at an extremely special guest for Episode 69 of the podcast. As of now they are on Episode 75 and continue to delay Episode 69. Most signs point towards it being Elon Musk (watching the podcasts, and the episode number, and Chamath being friends with Elon pretty much indicate this). Obviously this does not mean they would announce a DA for $IPOF &amp; Starlink on a podcast episode but it continues to be delayed. The currency hype and interest seems to be building off a potential DA (Definitive Agreement) reveal on 4/20 due to the number association with Musk again. **A DA is basically an agreement outlining which company the SPAC will be taking public.**\n\n**# Gamma Overload:**\n\n[Gamma Deez Nutz](https://preview.redd.it/c55p7m0g6it81.png?width=3783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db1f927b3715fca80a4d0c825d3241f9ef2888b2)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pde2qo0g6it81.png?width=1696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bacab1d9c2d01efc7ce5980774cc7775cf8c793\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9swccp0g6it81.png?width=1701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=281387d438ad02e81e97eee5cc283c87f0e82eac\n\n**## Currently $IPOF is ranked #3 on Fintel\u2019s Gamma Squeeze Score List with a score of 94.5.**\n\nAs we can see, current put/call ratio is around 0.14, with nearly **207,000 OI on today\u2019s expiry. 73,508 of these contracts are ITM 10Cs.**\n\n**The May 20th expiry has even more OI at nearly 225,000 contracts. 83,992 of these contracts are ITM 10Cs.**\n\nGiven the ridiculous amount of OI that remains ITM and a NAV of $10 with price around 3.5% above NAV, **it is very unlikely these calls end up OTM.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqw8smhh6it81.png?width=1701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=495a0b546250b761dd31a0d6fad24f6550cc4681\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0d11ohh6it81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdf8820466f2c2acf578126d2f9d1e0b6fc1218a\n\nYou can also see that nearly all of the premium across the chain is calls, and of that, a little over 50% is long, aka BTOs. **Across the 4/14 expiry, 123,605 contracts are long, meaning around 12.36M shares would be need to be bought to hedge. Based on volumes and accumulation, it is unlikely that full hedging has occurred.**\n\nThe $IPOF float is 115M shares, which is quite large, but **12.36M is about 10.7% of the float.** Just off net buy volume on the stock and price action, it is clear that many shares are **not hedged** even if STO calls provide net negative delta. Currently there are approximately **90k** more long calls open than short calls across the chain which still results in **9M or 7.8% of the float needed to be hedged fully.  Why does this matter? Options aren't pricing in the large move that would occur if MMs actually hedged.**\n\n**Options Implied Moved:**\n\nBased on ThinkOrSwims MM anticipated move (IV), which is based off of IV across the chain, currently a $0.236 move or **2.36% move is anticipated. Based on price action, MMs are not fully hedged and a 7.6% move would nearly 300% greater than expected and potentially blow MMs out of the water if they realize they should be hedging.**\n\n**Accumulation / Distribution:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nx4hyyzi6it81.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9811b6d458c15ef5f9ae6e6ca49ad9ab48c65cdf\n\nHere I introduce a handy indicator that shows net buying vs selling. With the average stock, net accumulation decreases when stock price goes down, and goes up when the price goes up. Simple and obvious. Yet $IPOF violates the laws of nature. Take for example the graph of $AMD and $AAPL. Accumulation trendline follows the stock price action almost 1:1.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pteez0yj6it81.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b22739ec7f6d419fc9bff4f5c7cf4bb8d527aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dc9yu0yj6it81.png?width=1355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=866be5a0a42d4ea5e9add1f43dd2e2c1faded701\n\nMeanwhile, $IPOF accumulation continuously increases in an upwards grind even as the stock was in a declining price pattern between April 7th and April 11th. Scrolling back further, this divergence can be seen in other periods as well. During larger drops such as the one end of yesterday and the day before, accumulation has barely gone down, and resumed its increase despite further volatility. **What this shows to me is consistent buy pressure and affirms the bullish trend on $IPOF.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6m43emk6it81.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7193238b9e9ef0677742aac0c9f958a0f4b7b64\n\nAdditionally, there have been many **unusually large darkpool purchases** in the past few weeks. Flow like this is quite uncommon for a pre-DA SPAC and highlights the potential for insiders or other parties anticipating an upcoming deal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qk9zngl6it81.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d9ea98408529736208bdbeed4fc4852c0de24a\n\n**Risks?**\n\nObviously this play is risky since it\u2019s based on speculation **BUT with a NAV of $10, no matter what you do, if someone bought shares right now, their maximum downside would be 3.5% as of writing this while upside is limitless.** ITM options are liquid and going a few months out is ideal as there is no guarantee a Starlink announcement will be made. **In the short term, $IPOF can rally hard due to a gamma squeeze today due to this being the final day before hundreds of thousands of OI expires on weeklies.**\n\n# TLDR; $IPOF is being speculated as the company that will take Starlink public and the insane options OI could result in a GAG (Gamma of All Gamma\u2019s) that would make $IPOF rally massively due to 90K contracts across the chain sufficiently ITM. It currently sits with the 3rd highest gamma score in the entire market and shares at NAV are a RiskFreeTrade\u2122. Not financial advice.",

    "selftext": "  Quick market run down for those awake before the bell\n\n$SPY\n\nGamma Environment: Negative (-1.2bn) \n\nKey Gamma Levels:\n\n14th\n\n450 - R3 resistance\n\n447 - R2 resistance\n\n445 - R1 resistance\n\n442 - S1 (First Support)\n\n438 - S2 (Second Support) \n\n435 - S3 (Third Support) \n\nViews:\n\n\\* Following the 80 point rally from the lows yesterday we noted that that the remaining strength despite a high PPI print as mentioned yesterday would likely be as a result of charm flows going into the market from MOPex. Using historical data on Opex without understanding the context of positioning automatically provides limited info on actual movements that are to be expected. \n\n\\* Based on macro conditions we do not expect natural buyers to exist and with negative seasonality appearing we do not expect bounces to be maintained.\n\n\\* VIX levels based volatility range of +1.3%/-1.3%, Negative gamma environment volatility is likely to continue to be more volatile than the prior week given the switch up in positioning. \n\n\\* SPY remains in less negative territory across the board (both short and long term) (now at $-1.2Bn, down from -$1.8bn yesterday looking two months forward). This has normalised the current levels for this this year, we can expect volatility to maintain and should also expect ranges on either side of the equation but a natural trend higher remains as the final parts of inventory are cleared. See gamma results in the discord to view peak positioning. We continue to maintain that the natural trend still remains lower and based on analogues May seems to be a reasonable point at which we reach a bottom. (There remains a LOT of cash on the side lines that is yet to be deployed). \n\n\\* Call volumes +12.8% and put volumes +4.97% with puts now only \\~2x the volume of calls, following a peak call/put volume disparities. This tells us that the hedge is now coming full circle and as a result given the \n\n\\* 10 Delta Put premiums (455C) vs call IV (at the 10 delta, 435P) is 1.5x in the short term and 1.6 xacross duration an IV basis, the skew here suggests that on the short term basis puts aren\u2019t favourable. They do however remain more favourable beyond this week. Additionally this vol isn\u2019t the highest read we have had thus far, with 2x presenting very strong risk reward. IV skew blows out below 425 and with the tails now currently offering an asymmetric return for those involved in the options market. Flows pushing lower should likely slow. \n\nOrderFlow\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/yfPjlxNP/\n\nFor order flow perspective levels please see the levels provided in the chart. See these lines as \u201cbarriers\u201d to overcome and if done then price can be \u201caccepted\u201d into areas where previous buyers (Navajo white = up volume) and sellers (purple = down volume) wanted to engage up until points where there are much greater levels of volume. These are areas that you can consider as greater points of resistance.\n\nCalls/Puts Volume\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/F4PHUd9Y/\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Scenario \n\nAbove 4444 (with continuous bid at 4460) ($ES) additional call buying to increase up the chain at further expiries and up the chain would be needed to continue this drive up. Note the skew toward call buying has lightened again but below we have a large delta of puts are set to unwind today which can give room to a bounce. We need put buying in further duration to lower and call buyers to move higher. Continuous exhaustion @ 4444 (we are at 4419 as of writing - having found repeat support at 4454) in the first 30 mins defines whether there is a clear aggressive direction and a move above could set us up for a hold above 4580 should positioning continue to drive higher. VIX crush below 18 will also help produce the environment we expect.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Scenario\n\nIf we maintain below 4400 in particular we\u2019re interested in further sell off as this level provides a key level down. That being said this remains a strong floor and looks unlikely to break where we assign a 17% probability of this breaking. A break below this could generate sell down to 4300 as Vanna flows above drive us lower and with put gamma at 4350 and below increasing exponentially. This begins to act as a magnet to price with selling intensifying from above and below. We would need to see call buying decline in AAPL/TSLA as well as semi weakness, very important as TSM has just reported upward guidance. VIX maintaining over 22, new highs with VIX combined with ES new lows 22 which adds credibility to increased sell. We would also need to see some weakness in big tech, in particular we note AAPL, TSLA, MSFT as these remain the key drivers of the prior rally particularly and strength in gold miners and other precious metal cos (NEM, GLD,SLV etc)",

    "title": "$LCID MegaDD",
    "selftext": "So I was at a dinner the other night and the topic of EVs came up regarding $TSLA and $LCID. To my surprise, everyone was gushing over LCID and how they can't wait to make it rich so their wife's boyfriends can go on yet again another vacation, while they stay in their mom's basement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut my biggest issue with $LCID isn't their wonderful built in house tech. It's the way they are positioning themselves in the market as a \"Luxury\" brand and shooting themselves in the foot with it. Before I get to why, lets discuss what is LUCID in the eyes and minds of the retards (you).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Lucid will do poorly short term as war rages, It will get bought off by AAPL or another tech giant or a heavy partnership will ensue with a real luxury brand and lift-off. LCID to $10 then to $100.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Long Version**\n\n**What is Lucid? (From the perspective of a Retard)**\n\n* It has real tech not like the other EV that put a diesel engine inside their EV truck and runs away with the money.\n* It has some dude who was the head of making the Model S - Elon Daddy doesn't like him. He speaks British and has a soothing voice.\n* The Lucid as a company aims to be a LUXURY brand, they don't see themselves as direct competitors to TSLA but to Mercedes.\n* Why I think LCID will get bought out by AAPL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My comments (Transcended Retard) to each of the viewpoints above**\n\n&gt;It has real tech not like the other EV that put a diesel engine inside their EV truck and runs away with the money.\n\nI agree, no one thought they could actually deliver something yet, they not only proved everyone wrong but they have the most efficient battery miles per KwH AND an in house motor that is unparalleled (until TSLA upgrades theirs in soon time - which will remove them from this only advantage point)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It has some dude who was the head of making the Model S - Elon Daddy doesn't like him\n\nElon is a big reason for TSLA success, don't get me wrong, there are exceptional engineers that work at TSLA, SpaceX etc. But that's because of the love and ambition of Elon and his vision. He goes on podcasts, he sends a shit ton of memes. He says fuck you to SEC. And everyone in the finance world love it. The amount of volatility and gainz he brings through his twitter alone is daunting. It creates more volume, speculation and price action and he knows that. Peter (the british guy) is not Elon, he's a real engineer and is putting the car (product) in front which is great! But it's not enough to get a slice of what they want from this sector.  Elon is thinking low cost, scale and annihilating through tweets (he has no marketing team, he has tweets). Lucid has none of that, But they have luxury, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;LCID is aiming to be a LUXURY brand, it's not competing really with TSLA, so fuck Elon!\n\nLets go to the basics.\n\n**Definition of luxury** \\- *the state of great comfort and extravagant living*. Top lux brands are Porsche, Gucci, lots of purses, ferrari etc etc. Apple is a top brand, not a Luxury brand, but we will get to that later.\n\n**Definition of a successful Brand -** When you see the brand, it awakes something inside the persons psyche (mind fuckin) that the organization wants you to.\n\nA successful **luxury** **brand** for Lucid is, when anyone sees it, drives it, sits in it, they should feel like it's the best experience they've ever had in a car. It should feel like a private jet for fuck sake inside and outside,  It needs to turn heads.\n\nI've yet to test drive the LCID, but I did go to a store to check it out. It felt good, massage seat, nice panels, sunroofs, etc.... but it didn't FEEL luxury; I hope this changes with the drive. Alexa Integration isn't luxury, Third party integrations isn't luxury.\n\nAnd finally, TSLA is playing the long game, they are scaling and don't care about building premium but their brand is def going to get a premium line eventually. The moment, Model S integrates better material and massage seats and what not, what differentiates LCID?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why I think LCID will get bought out by AAPL.\n\nAAPL history with TSLA is interesting, Elon sent email to Cook to buy TSLA which didn't get read. AAPL hired bunch of team to try to build their own car, then decided to scrap it. I haven't been keeping up to see if they still are and I think they would be fools to join the race now. So why would AAPL be interested in LCID? Because LCID is like the baby AAPL wishes it had, because it reminds them of who they are.\n\n**Story Telling and Design, Design, Design.**\n\nWhat's in it for AAPL? Battery Tech and an opening into a new sector that's not limited to just automobiles but can be expanded into jets, boats.",

    "selftext": "With the recent sell off in a lot of stocks, we are going to be faced with a once in a lifetime opportunity to accumulate some of the world\u2019s most cutting edge companies. Now is the time to be building your watch lists of companies that you have strong conviction in over the next 5 years +. Don\u2019t fret over the short term price fluctuations as some of the major market cap companies are guaranteed to rebound in the future. Now is the time to be accumulating positions in companies that have long term potential. Trying to time the market now will be difficult and accurately timing a bottom is almost impossible, even with some of the most advanced charting technology the world has ever seen. We could see further price depreciation but the lower we go, the greater the opportunity. Stocks are a long term play. Don\u2019t expect to get rich overnight as that\u2019s not realistic for most people. Sure, some people get extremely lucky or maybe are just talented investors but for the most part, this is about the long term game. Some stocks take 3-5 years or more to return good returns. The best thing in my opinion that you could do right now are to accumulate stocks in companies that you have the highest conviction in. Now is the time to set aside for these plays that will be life changing for you in the future. Your future self will thank you for having the fortitude to begin accumulating stocks in great companies. I personally invest in the following companies: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, WMT, JPM, UPS, XOM, PLD, UNH, NEE, COIN, NEM, BHP. These are the largest market cap companies from each sector (minus coin) giving me complete exposure to all sectors. I encourage you all to create a diversified, yet concentrated portfolio such as this to give you the greatest opportunity at success, while limiting your risk through diversification. Nothing is guaranteed but I believe in these companies and will continue to accumulate stocks in these companies for the remainder of my lifetime. If the stocks go further down, then this is a further opportunity to lower my cost basis in some amazing companies. But enough with the rant and please tell me about some of the holdings you have and why you hold them. I am always interested in learning more about great companies. Good luck everyone and don\u2019t let these price swings get you down. Look at them as an amazing, once in a lifetime opportunity to accumulating some killer companies.",

    "selftext": "Going to try to do this again, with a slightly different approach. I've made similar posts in the past, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/_foldLeft/draft/27f7aafa-c316-11ec-9327-fe7c61585b68).\n\nIn this post I'll run down through various charts - indices, ETFs, some single stocks - to try to create some insight into the market. **We're trying to establish some notion of** ***what's doing well***, ***what's not doing well***, and ***what some market indicators might be telling us***.\n\nI try to refrain from making outright conclusions, or recommendations - this is supposed to be informative, to help people learn there's more stuff in the market than TSLA, NVIDIA, AMD, etc, and how they can look at these other assets to help them make better trade decisions (if an entire sector is on the downturn, maybe you don't want to be buying calls on a single stock in that sector).\n\n# Indices\n\n[SPY 1y](https://preview.redd.it/86xswtxshav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e979e7c576976870c4adfdbce88fbd3d06f3c0df)\n\n[QQQ 1y](https://preview.redd.it/9rmfad1xhav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a3f9f0b0ecfd89c2287d345c1bff064f40b632)\n\n[QQQ 3y](https://preview.redd.it/vdpcr1vxhav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c93c183901376cd36a593b58f8be1410288d07f)\n\n* SPY and QQQ rolled over again into the end of the week, with some pretty heavy selling. Technical-wise we're kinda in no-man's land as of Friday's close, with both indices hovering a bit above their March lows. I suspect we continue down and re-test those, but then the real questions get asked: *is this just a re-test and we bounce? Or do valuations reset further and we have more pain to go?*\n\n[IWM 1y](https://preview.redd.it/9rdxsa3ziav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8edf04c8893d514ade28b7fe537f368b524b8f85)\n\n[IWM 3y](https://preview.redd.it/1ydq8uvrjav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ce70768bb46e3a9e23191eea5cc14dfe7f63b9e)\n\n* Small caps were range-bound for a large part of 2021, and in November broke out. Ultimately this breakout failed, and in retrospect (IMO) really portended the downturn that spread to the rest of the market in January 2022.\n* Small caps have traded down close to %20 from their highs, and have chopped sideways in a lower range as the rest of the market has followed it down. IMO, no rally is legitimate unless we see small caps follow through, and I think we need to get back above the 212 mark in IWM to have any confidence in a rally. If we break below 190, watch for 170 (pre-covid high) as the next level of support.\n\n[RUA 1y](https://preview.redd.it/9kis30r1jav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad63d6ee9b2acbc22544fb26a16fb6b578ba6dbc)\n\n* For those that are unaware, the RUA is the Russell 3000, essentially (but just not quite) the entire US stock market. This is just one way to get a broad view of how everything is performing.\n* Like the SPY and QQQ, this looks to be in no-man's land as well, and I suspect we'll revisit that bottom line in the near-term.\n\n# Sectors\n\n[Sector Performance Comparison, 6m](https://preview.redd.it/c3biqjk1pav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17492eeadbdee92bda290670476a9741c6dbbaf9)\n\n* This is a pretty busy, but handy chart I look at to give me an idea of relative performance across many market sectors. It's been useful the last few years as we've had a ton of rotation between different areas of the market, and this can help me spot that and trade momentum accordingly.\n* Very recently defensives like health care and consumer stables have been outperforming relative to the broader market, though they gave a bit back this week.\n* The drawdown this week was definitely market-wide, which is somewhat worrying.\n* Energy has still been outperforming, which makes sense given the inflation narrative and what's going on in the world.\n* Curiously, Utilities (XLU) have been outperforming. This is curious because normally in a rising rates environment utilities would underperform.\n\nI'm not going to go through all of these individually, but we'll take a look at a few which are interesting given present market conditions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DJU vs US10y, \\~10y](https://preview.redd.it/3tbtzd4u9hv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d5546a5ca68404a1f6b91e03246d44e6ab3c7b3)\n\n* This is showing the Dow Jones Utilities index compared with the US10y yield, since \\~2012. I've tried to mark out a particular correlation: when yields go up, generally utilities underperform, as they are yield-sensitive. There's been a divergence recently as utilities have been bid up while yields are rising. We should expect this divergence to break down, it may have just started last week.\n\n[DJTA vs DJIA, 1y](https://preview.redd.it/ppiwuckwahv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86599693add472cdd736299968860e49d8688cfc)\n\n* Here we're taking a look at the lately-talked-about Dow Theory, which suggests that if one of the Dow Jones Industrials or Down Jones Transports advances above a previous important high/level, *and the other follows suit*, then the market is most likely in an upward trend.We saw the transports, DJTA, break out during that rally in the second half of March, but the industrials chopped sideways during the same time, not confirming the upward trend and providing some signal that the March rally was most likely a bear market rally and sell-the-rip moment. Transports have since given it all back and traded in-line with the industrials.\n\nMoving on...\n\n# Bonds, Dollar, Sentiment\n\n[HYG, 5y](https://preview.redd.it/xej48stqchv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf84ee13480fec24e409c47b9f8b303348fd4ee)\n\n[LQD, All Time](https://preview.redd.it/kmv6bttqchv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b17226739a445c9430e1da3058e8d5e2d324620d)\n\n* Aside from government treasuries, it's worth looking at what's going on with corporate credit, bonds sold by US corporations. HYG tracks US high-yield (bad) credit, LQD tracks US \"investment-grade\" (good) credit - companies like JPM, AAPL, etc.Both of these have been rolling over as yields rise (the yields on these bonds are all rising too), and are right around some pretty serious support levels. Personally, I think we start to stabilize or get a pullback in yields near-term, with 3% likely a good top level for the US10y. Or we could just blow through that and see even more carnage in bond markets, which has been historical.\n\n[DXY, 5y](https://preview.redd.it/gihesmeydhv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=295444f30da5c1aab6b22e05179baf6350f90313)\n\n* The DXY is a measure of the US dollar against a \"basket\" of other currencies, but mostly the Euro (50-something % of this index). Dollar outperformance is bad for the US and a lot of US companies: while it gives us more purchasing power abroad, it *raises the cost for foreign purchasers to buy from us*, which hurts revenues. The DXY above $100 is bad news for US stocks, and right now it looks like it's going to try for that recent 5y-high at 102.\n\n[AAII Sentiment](https://preview.redd.it/bxj6k609ghv81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f9d30292416bb1a49e71ce25e922179b851198)\n\n[CCN Money Fear and Greed Index](https://preview.redd.it/3zxqymkaghv81.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b94ec301a00c3aa522cc03e178fe028c6a6a077)\n\n[NYSE New Lows vs New Highs](https://preview.redd.it/2i96umvdghv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3022c0a0bcd56d04885a14c9de0fc027c200567)\n\n* Sentiment is still broadly bearish, but I believe (as others) that we haven't yet hit max capitulation - we still need that final panic selling moment and that's when you can buy. I'm not actually sure we'll get that, or know it in the moment, but I'd be inclined to be bearish for the time being.\n* NYSE new lows vs new highs really broke down last week. Those stocks you think can't go lower, well they can.\n\nGonna call it there for this week.",

Today may have started red but if you're not buying this dip, you are truly retarded!  \n\nI don't give a fuck if you're worried about higher interest rates or not, right HERE and NOW is the once in a lifetime oppurtinity to buy that sweet, tasty dip like you've just won a LIFETIME supply of TENDIES! \n\nAllow me to present my DD:\n\nEver since the second half of 2020, inflation fears have been slowly factoring into stock valuations, and starting in november it's absolutely been making people PANIC!  \n\nTECH and BONDS are especially hit hard when inflation is high, as we are all aware given how far we've seen them come down.  \n\nThe fed raising interest rates by .5% or .25% in early may could stoke the sell off, but I DON'T CARE and niether should you.\n\nI'm making my money THIS WEEK, because we've got some mammoth weighted QQQ stocks reporting this week.  \n\nTo name a few:\nAAPL (12.51% of QQQ) THURSDAY\nMSFT (10.15% of QQQ) TUESDAY\nGOOG/GOOGL (7.54% of QQQ) TUESDAY\nAMZN (7.28% of QQQ) THURSDAY\nTOTAL (37.48% of QQQ)\n\n\ud83d\udea8DID YOU CATCH THAT\ud83d\udea8\n\n37.48% of QQQ is reporting THIS WEEK!\n\nThese are the companies that are thriving and can pull the weight of whatever ETF they're in.   they will provide TEMPORARY relief from the shit storm that has been 2022, and considering that the IV levels right now have only been reached a handful of times in the last 2 decades, A GIGANTIC U-TURN in QQQ is probable.  Also, we are approaching some significant support levels when looking at QQQ.  This is the perfect storm for a reversal to a LEGENDARY RALLY!

    "selftext": " \n\n**Respected Traders and Investors,**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you traders are having a fantastic blast since March FOMC 16th. Making the money up in the 3rd strongest bear market rally and then also on the way down. Congratulations guys. You guys are awesome..!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut yeah not so much for investors. Things have been crazy lately for people whose investing horizon is less than 2 years. As for passive investors with a time horizon more than 10yrs, well i guess they are still cold &amp; chilly as the weather in Antarctica with diamond hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stocks &amp; Bond Market Winter - Dividend - Commodities XD](https://preview.redd.it/s13zdwz2wlv81.jpg?width=5442&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80089cec976ba2ab24f6a6644bca7609815086b2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts really been a long time guys. So quick recap for those who are new to my channel and what we have predicted so far.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said an exit liq rally will come in q2/q3 after March 16th.

And hey, don't forget the most important thing i have been trying to superimpose in everyone's mind by repeating it, that in Q4 2022-23 we will have a recession. ( Basic theory : As calculated by 6-24 months after inversion of the curve )\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, we have been discussing the importance of war in Russia Ukraine ( Still going ), Sovereign Debt crisis ( Lebanon, Srilanka, Russia after my post ), Covid ( Do you guys see how corporate people are using their power to avoid shutdown even though CDC is telling to ), China Yuan reserve currency ( Its happening. Zoltan wrote a great piece about it in his work BW 3 ) etc, in the comments section. I have to say, you guys are super smart. I was never expecting that my post would be read by some of the professional people in the investing world. So thank you...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sorry guys : But im still writing about it. Feels like i'm writing a book on Sovereign Debt](https://preview.redd.it/psn953bhwlv81.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d15c634284ac21e019d1c9d26a9b66648bcbba1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome other calls that I made :\n\n1. My bond bust calls are going well, too. Hopefully by June bond carnage will stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We talked about this theory technically in Credit Risk America](https://preview.redd.it/a7xooednwlv81.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0462236e78b675bcada45032d33aceb56c96ff86)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally i haven't told anyone to short bonds cause when some of you asked me I told you it's too late. But do keep an eye on CDS and time it with recession. You could make 20-1 this time around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CDS in USA 5yr. These things went up dramatically before Recession and Credit Risk.](https://preview.redd.it/fzmcjigpwlv81.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f5b6695e94926497b60d736e532a852f7ec2785)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. DXY has also gone to $100, just as we predicted as it's a basic Wyckoff accumulation pattern of 20yrs. The only thing that remains is when the FED will inject QE+ and debase their currency again. I have told this too to some of you in the comments section that i see it happening after the recession, not before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DXY is at $101 now. So you can see how far we have come from.](https://preview.redd.it/pu8y4qdswlv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f5b8383acba5e9bf2dcc49046314a59d692cb8f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Cash is Haven\n\nYah, i know most people wont agree with this thought. But my readers know how well it's going to hold up to cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Why is cash important?](https://preview.redd.it/061jekkuwlv81.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=516bd0e240c9a400bc127209a30b12917053e382)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you know why I said so ? Because I was waiting for an option other than \" TINA \" Its bonds. That's why I told you all to HODL cash. Now some might argue well, how are we going to fight inflation. Well, you can't this year, but surely in 10yr you can. You just have to look at Real Bond yields chart. They are positive. Meaning investors are keeping an eye on that. And i can sure as hell tell you Bank of America is buying coz, they have set their targets 2.35% at 10yr note.\n\nSo buy bonds and you get a half-yearly payment on it. And when that payment arrives in lets say Q4 or the 2023 recession. Buy your favorite money-making stocks at a cheaper price or Gold (coz Gold too, falls in Recession). It's that simple strategy. And also pray that bonds don't get obliterated in this coming recession like a 4sigma bubble collapse. I'm betting things will take turns. First bonds then the housing market, later on putting pressure on stocks, and the word which i cannot speak here.\n\nBut the key would be to buy which bonds and at what time?\n\nSo i would recommend a 2yr / 5yr for flipping and 10yr bond as an investment. Time would be May June period. So time it with your T.A. on bonds using Daily and weekly TF. I have given you the month. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Billionaires Buy Zone for TLT : 16 May - 16 June 2022](https://preview.redd.it/me094upezlv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=580550c7334322f5df589ea8b9784fa2139579bc)\n\nSo I think I have given you a rough idea of what we have predicted so far. But as time progresses things could turn, but so far it's all going according to our plan.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been the longest recap in the history of the WSB, i suppose. But now lets move on from this and take a look at what has happened these past weeks and how are we gonna trade in May-June intelligently so that we don't get lost in the volatility jungle.\n\nKey events that have happened and some that are coming up :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Earnings Season :**\n\na) Bank Earnings :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Banks](https://preview.redd.it/rs9h8l64xlv81.jpg?width=5184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c0c03156449b34a2748e2bf00eb3e416059d1ee)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJP Morgan\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSo JP Morgan kicked off with earnings last week. I must say something seems fishy there with Nickel Trading and their losses in Russia. Just like any other conspiracy theorist, i cannot help but wonder that the books are being cooked there. Regardless, though, i love Jamie Dimon, and if you are reading this, sir, you did a great job this decade. I wish you \"Happy Retirement\" early on. Wall Street will miss you when you leave office this year.\n\nHighlights of earnings :\n\n\\-&gt; People have more cash in q1 than q4. I bet some of the people took profits\n\n\\-&gt; There was a rise in debt by people. And combined credit + plus debt rose 21% compared to last year.\n\n\\-&gt; Earnings were bad for JPM. Hence EPS low. They suffered some losses in Russia and also the transactional revenue has declined. But they offered share buybacks from May 1 which is bullish. Overall, if you are investing in banks, it's complicated. But hey, some institutions think JPM is trading at a discount of $20-30, so there's that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoldman &amp; Morgan stanley\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe same was the story with these two giants. Making money. Their traders made a killing in q1. but trading revenue isn't that high compared to last yr. And consumers are still spending like no tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBank of America\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\-&gt; Defaults are lower than 2019 levels..\n\n\\-&gt; Mortgage rate up\n\n\\-&gt; Q1 opened more credit cards. And they are spending more.\n\n\\-&gt; Relaxation by China later on in Q2 and Russia situation by Victory Day ( They believe it. Not me )\n\nSo overall i would say, we kinda expected this from bank earnings. They didn't beat our expectations by huge numbers and they all took a hit from Russia. Going into Q4 we would see rates, yields up and a steepening curve. So banks should do well theoretically. Well, they aren't for now. But that could soon change once we get more clarity from the FED. Otherwise we are gonna get a financial crisis on top of a recession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Tech Earnings :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Next week is so important guys. Stay sober.](https://preview.redd.it/wkbsiqgaxlv81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab16fbf1ffe2cb61d39211d069872d813486790)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5/6 mega cap tech giant making up $8T dollar market cap are coming next week. They carry the entire S&amp;P500 on their backs. Lets see how they perform next week. Finger crossed.\n\nBut lets talk about this hilarious Dotcom-style chart from a company called Netflix. What a script it has written. I feel sorry for Bill Ackman that i really wanna invest in it. Kidding XD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Netflix : My Buy entries \\( White Lines \\)](https://preview.redd.it/i48kqrzcxlv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1075ccfc933209bce42e8bb118336abd689c4ce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets analyze what happened with it\n\n1. The Advertizing business is getting hit by Apple. It happened in January too with NFLX, FB ,SNAP. And soon Google will follow Apple's path.\n2. Inflation man. Its killing the future earnings of growth stocks combined with increased competition from HBO Max, Disney and Apple TV, which are seriously more good than netflix content.\n3. Took hit from Russia, Ukraine and Elon Woke tweets. Hence, Lost subscribers.\n4. Its strategy of pricing power by doubling amounts and flip flopping on password sharing didn't work out as they hoped. ( remember those tweets from before )\n\nOverall, its a consumer discretionary growth stocks and not worthy to be named together with FAANG. I'll go with MANGA from here now ( MSFN , AAPL , NVIDIA , GOOGL , AMZN ) Meta and Netflix need a break.\n\nNote : Even though NFLX got steam rolled from every part you could think of. But it's soon going to have a pullback from Stranger Things 4 which no one is talking about. So trade well, my friends, but remember, don't get attached. It will fall to $120-130 later on is what i believe. ( -83% crash. Love that number ) Could possibly go to $60-80 in recession. Would be a good buy then for next 10yrs.\n\nI also wanted to talk about Twitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Twitter Bullish Chart if Elon Buys the Company](https://preview.redd.it/46ambgyfxlv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce3fb959b78b6ced3ab95b2fe52ff9294cae0e63)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust by looking at charts from back to December 2013, you can probably see that the company hasn't done anything innovating. Maybe that's what you get when you run a company on Blood money ( The person who created the platform is out )\n\nSo, as we all know Elon wants to buy the company because he wants to bring free speech to one of the biggest networking platforms of our generations. He could have built his own social networking media company like Trump did. But he understands the power of the networking effect. Hence he pitched his offer of $54.20 ( i would look it as \"May 4\" 420 means : crazy times at FOMC ) and freed up some cash.\n\nSo the board of directors can either take it or leave it. But the chart says to me that they don't want to give up a financial weapon and promote free speech. Hence they are taking the poison pill approach against Elon's hostile takeover.\n\nSo Elon comes up with an argument and says every board has a fiduciary duty towards its share holders. And it should take steps to benefit the company. So the board decided lets just calm the environment themselves and gave up a holiday to employees who were worried of getting fired by Elon Musk. That just speaks to me, of the direction in which the company is headed.\n\nImo, this board either has a magical plan to turn the ship around or they are just too dumb to recognize the potential of this company.\n\nOnly time will tell what's going to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. May 3-4 : Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC )**\n\nPowell, Brainard, Daly ( President of San Fransico ) , Summers ( Former FED Secretary of the Treasury 1999-2001 ), Bullard ( President of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis )\n\nThese 5 guys have eaten the head out of me. Why in the world do we have to keep watching them as they speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[FED buy sell indicator](https://preview.redd.it/j8dkz57nxlv81.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a25642d6f292965f23aeb4e5980df53f9f3f0db)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEspecially Powell guys. I am beginning to think that the FED has lost all credibility. They are being dishonest and rigging the market. Look at Sarah Eisen at FED. She basically asked Powell everything before the IMF presentation and took a short position. She put Powell on the spot by asking tough questions like \"Do you want the market to go lower\" and about \"Rate hikes\".\n\nTo which Powell replied \"Ahhhhhhhhh\" for the first and the second one \"50bps is on the table\"\n\nMarkets crashed immediately that day and the day later when reports emerged of 50bps being priced for May - June - July. Just wow.\n\nWe went from \"Inflation is transitory\" , \"25bps gradual hikes in March 16 FOMC\" to consecutive \"50bps\" with faster tightening cycles. And also removing balance sheet accomodation.\n\nLets look now at FOMC to see if they actually can live up to their word and hike 50bps. If they did well, its pretty much priced in and we don't have to care much about the first 100bps, but if they went with 25bps. Markets should go up.\n\nAlso, the FED fund future is now targeting 3.25% for EOY. Lets see how it all unravels. Personally i would watch Overnight repo and Spreads even though last time like in 2018 case wont happen. Because now the FED has a facility watching for unusual rates movements.\n\nAlso do look out for the data in USA GDP. 2 quarters of -ve GDP is recession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. May 6 : Jobs report**\n\nLike it or not, the jobs market is overheated. A wage price spiral started to happen in January report, but not so much now. Maybe this report of may could show us that again.\n\nFor now, I dont think Job's numbers matter much now. More, of the jobs added to the current est. only gives FED more initiative to hike rates as they like or talk like 75bps or even 100bps.\n\nBut here's an interesting chart that I would like to share that literally no one is talking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Recession : Gray U reverse, Orange : Wage growth yoy, Red : CPI yoy, White : FED funds rate](https://preview.redd.it/fv7592hpxlv81.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56caf1fb7c653f47df7600a3495e78e1226ee2a9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to point out two, but maybe you guys can find three interesting things in the chart :\n\n1. If inflation &gt; or near the proximity of wage, then the FED hands are forced to increase the FED funds rates and cause recession.\n2. During the tightening cycle, wages tend to decrease downwards later on. This would mean that companies would come under some kind of pressure during this phase of the cycle.\n3. Is your H.W. XD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. May 9 : Victory Day**\n\nSo why is this day so important. Well, top professionals say like 1000 crazy but drunk people like me on Wallstreet think that the stock market hasn't seen quite huge a selloff as it should. Maybe the reason behind it is the fact \"Buy at the sound of cannon and sell at the noise of trumpets rally\" is going on, and its creating an opposite effect to FED put theory ( I am sure you must know about Greenspan, Bernanke, and now Powell put. I dont know how Janet Yellen missed the train. Comments down below XD)\n\nThis theory is quite simple. You buy at peak fear and you sell at peak greed. Kinda like, \"Bad news is good news and good news is bad news\". I hope you all are getting my point.\n\nYou can also check historical returns, i am sure that would back my theory.\n\nHere's the last time when similar situation happened. And people, i apologize beforehand if this chart brings back haunting memories from the past or you have situations related to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Afghanistan War : Invasion October 2001 : Buy and sell later on b\\/w 56-90 days.](https://preview.redd.it/57ba424sxlv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a0ddd0cc1d788f61feea473a5d469d3258be6e1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is my current projection. Lets see how this works out.](https://preview.redd.it/ohww16gtxlv81.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61322dc8ec0ff4eaffbbcfe9eb2d35b6de7a2546)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. May 11 : CPI ( Consumer Price Index )**\n\nWell, I am sure by now everybody has figured out what happens during the CPI and what data we look for. For those who dont know. Well, allow me to explain :\n\nNowadays we all know the CPI will come higher.\n\nSo 3-4 days before the CPI, the market starts selling off. But when CPI exp. comes out lower, then the market starts to go up.\n\nBut when CPI gets released there are always some few things that bother everybody and make a issue out of. So the market decides to sell regardless. Buy the rumor good CPI and sell the news CPI and then go up a few days later.\n\nIf the horrible CPI comes out then go much lower than we started that up rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oil &amp; Gas prices moving up](https://preview.redd.it/jf9uwv0vzlv81.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fffa9d6aca8a970d9b40243b6c5b328def6ee23)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are few metrics that are deciding whether it's a good or bad CPI report\n\na) Core PCE inflation : Well, this is the inflation that FED targets cause its from the demand side. Its the CPI inflation minus the food and energy. We need to see it decrease month over month so that we can see the inflexion point in the curve when supply-driven inflation comes down.\n\nb) The Headline Inflation : This is the headline, number inflation which comes out to scare off the people. This number constitutes the food and energy part, which recently has been called \"Putin Price Hike\" in America.\n\nNote : The inflation you're seeing is not only from Putin but also from the excess money printing and helicopter money distributed after the pandemic. The value of the dollar has gone down significantly, and it takes about 2yrs to see the full effect of monetary policy, which you're seeing it now.\n\nSo the same case could be made for this tightening cycle, if it actually went through, which would let us see the bottom of all bottoms in late 2023-2024. But no doubt you can see some strong reaction rallies in the bear market too. I hope that makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Closing thoughts :**\n\nWell, now I wanted to talk about how Nasdaq, SP500 , Russell 2000 and Dow Jones might witness a price action which would take a route using my fundamental analysis with technical analysis.\n\nBut sorry guys, i'm busy and have to go somewhere. You guys can check out the technical analysis down below and time it with your own fundamental analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S&amp;P500](https://preview.redd.it/kfybg1l00mv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aafafba0f31f7a4e73d3c38204b1942c583aafe)\n\n[Nasdaq 100](https://preview.redd.it/mdv1wxk00mv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8dbcb716f3d60adf7d84b8fc060af6266fdc0b1)\n\nBut still, i might give you a hint.\n\nCase 1 :\n\nAs we all know April doesn't look so good so far. But im expecting a comeback rally in the last weeks of April, provided if the tech earnings are good enough that it impresses the investors. Once we go up then sell in may gets activated because you cant get past the extreme risk off weeks till CPI at May 11. But hopefully month over month core pce comes down and then we kickstart the bear market up rally again till last few weeks of May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor the other thing that could happen is\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase 2 :\n\nThe tech earnings doesn't impresses investors. We go down. More people start buying FED puts for FOMC and it piles up so much that we go down horribly before FOMC. Powell then comes out in the interview and calms everything down. And hopefully we go up again and get slightly pulled off by CPI, but then CPI comes good and we kickstart the up rally again to last few weeks of May and sell again before FOMC.\n\nP.s : I didn't feel like writing these past few days. Because my post was getting rejected last time for no reason at all. Its still there and i would like that if you enjoyed this piece of mine. Do check that one out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Your guide to Q2 USA stock Market\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil next time guys.

Here are the results.\n\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.72 vs $2.56 expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\n* **Revenue:** $27.91 billion vs $28.2 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\nWall Street is also watching other key numbers in the Meta report:\n\n* **Daily Active Users (DAUs):** 1.95 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n* **Monthly Active Users (MAUs):** 2.97 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n* **Average Revenue per User (ARPU):** $9.50 expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nMeta is updating investors for the first time since a [brutal fourth-quarter earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/facebook-shares-plummet-22percent-after-reporting-weak-guidance.html) in February sent the stock down 26%, its worst day ever. Daily active users declined for the first time and the company forecast weaker-than-expected growth.\n\nFirst-quarter results should shed light on how macroeconomic trends like inflation and the war in Ukraine may be impacting ad spending on the platform. Growth is expected to come in at 7.8%, slipping into the single digits for the first time in Facebook\u2019s 10-year history as a public company.\n\nIn[ Snap](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SNAP)\u2019s [earnings ](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/snap-earnings-q1-2022.html)last week, CEO Evan Spiegel said the period \u201cproved more challenging than we had expected.\u201d [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) followed with [disappointing numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/alphabet-to-report-q1-earnings-after-the-bell-tuesday.html) on Tuesday, largely attributable to [weak ad spend on YouTube](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/youtubes-huge-miss-shows-digital-media-ad-market-is-getting-hit-hard.html).\n\nAnalysts will also be watching to see how Facebook is navigating [Apple\u2019s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL) new app transparency rules, which Meta CFO Dave Wehner said last quarter would result in a [$10 billion revenue hit this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html).\n\nWehner told analysts on the company\u2019s earnings call at the time that the figure was an estimate of the overall impact of the iOS changes on 2022 revenue.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be precise on this. It\u2019s an estimate,\u201d he acknowledged, adding that the company believes the impact will be \u201csubstantial.\u201d\n\nWith the stock down almost 50% this year, Meta\u2019s guidance will be of particular importance to investors looking for signs of optimism. Second-quarter growth is expected to slow to 5.3%, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv, resulting in revenue of $30.6 billion. That\u2019s down from 56% a year earlier.",

    "title": "Wall Street Newsletter 2 : The \"5 Questions\" that every Wall Street guy is asking but no one is answering.",
    "selftext": "**Respected Traders and Investors,**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSobbing and crying :\\_(\n\nI\u2019m sorry guys. I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I\u2019m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date.\n\nSo I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession.  But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. \n\nNow, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post.\n\n  \n\n\n[Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed.](https://preview.redd.it/6g78v16b00x81.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a5b3fc8938ad33265022ed285ed637ad47787f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Earnings season :**\n\nAs we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&amp;P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tech Earnings Season](https://preview.redd.it/ah5otfma10x81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1405b4fa92b679c534e704f4e658937cb8ddfc72)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis**\n\nMonday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[KO Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/6abdl35r10x81.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e104c2f19b2a66953b5eca0791ee13b54eb3e4)\n\nWhen Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation.\n\nSo the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[KO T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/f4vvws6320x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efff82a22fde6f90dfa592d793cf4243a4b2e0a0)\n\nAs for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call \"Bearish divergence\" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered.\n\nIf the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop )**\n\nBoi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/gzt1xcxn30x81.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=198cd7f826b6f836065df8033534ebb92d946127)\n\nMicrosoft kickstarted the show with a beating est. Hence stock rallied. They too had earnings quite similar to Coke..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/ey7fso5v30x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25ef0eb1ab175a74c28b0d8a581baf5e5478703)\n\nAs for technicals, well, the earnings were great so im not expecting a 1.618 but just 1 fib guarantees for the ABC correction wave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GOOGL Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/9ohl93m640x81.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53b27e63405637e4f0c695aeec6727ed2c786c79)\n\n \n\nBot now came the google earnings in after hours. Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly.\n\nBut the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours.\n\nBut visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because  transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GOOGL T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/1so6uh4w40x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c41a2ed50046c7d5349da599826a926a7517aa9b)\n\n \n\nAs for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 )**\n\nOh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A.\n\nWell Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up.\n\nPaypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing.\n\nPins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased.\n\nQualcomm, I have no idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/9kl9bd6x50x81.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15ec5df4b9853fb74e75575a31946b4cc206ebc)\n\n[AAPL Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/3mcjrf6x50x81.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be191d9f21931c96c2ba2f7914e1cfb1cec3fc6)\n\nThursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nNo one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/cuoe18en60x81.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e598b375e2e51a77d373b7b630e46791e2635488)\n\n[AAPL T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/3y02o2en60x81.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e922591b08a5c7a0211381e858d0d6c4b5db32f)\n\nAs for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. \n\nFor Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day**\n\nThink of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&amp;P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Things are only going to get much worse from here. \n\n So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market.\n\nSo find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life.\n\n( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering :\n\n \n\n**Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates.**\n\nSo my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike](https://preview.redd.it/1vn8aej890x81.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcb1c6c62e6b2af53f83506c3349f5cd1bd4126)\n\nThe answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the \"Taylor rule\" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me.\n\nSo now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6duok8ob0x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d136ac9bb1ccfcc2d4c71b5617bff9a2f51f5d6\n\nSo idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong.\n\nHypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023.\n\nHere\u2019s the calculation on how it could.\n\n50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy.\n\n5 X 0.50 = 2.5%\n\nTotal = 5.75%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what impact will it have ?\n\nAlmost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[At the end of large cycles we have Recession](https://preview.redd.it/wdrp0i1ec0x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8c1abbf5a3effd16fca362fc109443e055ae0c4)\n\nHypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2%\n\nWelcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : \"Million Dollar Advise\"\n\nLets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GDP negative  print vs Stock Market crash](https://preview.redd.it/4z2uis46d0x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4f8de83709aef26c240cf187fe5acce0fb3a957)\n\nThis chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no\u2019s are going to be positive or negative. \n\n\\- If we are going to get positive no\u2019s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. \n\n\\- if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. \n\nSo you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% &amp; -40% and cancel the noise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed**\n\nWe have talked about this in \u201c Credit risk america \u201c post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. \n\nAs for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Terminal Rate](https://preview.redd.it/ood4lc70e0x81.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596d6e54b6360f23d350f75fd52a0489bb19452f)\n\nRemember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q3 : How much lower will stocks go?**\n\nWell, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top.\n\n( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q4 : What is coming \"Short Recession\", \"Stagflation\", \"Depression\" ?**\n\nFirst will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity.\n\nNow we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity?**\n\nFor this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works.\n\nRemember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool.

    "title": "Nasdaq on ~11000 fair value eoy 2022",
    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nFed: 2,5% + 1,5% of your broker means 4%\n\nFor taking the risk I want 3%\n\nMeans I want companies with PE ratio of 14 max.\n\nLook at the S&amp;P and Nas and calculate the correction.\n\nI am analyzing the market for quite a while. What people await is a big relief rally, which will not happen in near future. The reasons are as mentioned: Most S&amp;P 500 companies, e.g. lets pick the biggest one: AAPL (Apple) has a PE of about 24/25 now. This means:\n\nI invest 100$ for a company, which has an expected earning of 4$. The expected growth is lets say 10% per year. This means, that Apple will earn 4.40$ next year, and 6.44$ in 5 years per share (4$ * 1.15 = 6.44$). Which means, that the company will have earning per share of 6.44%in 5 years or a PE ratio of (1/0,0644) = 15,52 in 5 years.\n\nOnce Apple projects a growth rate less than 10%, lets assume: 3% or no grwoth (recession, caused by upcoming rate hikes, FED tries to slow down economy,..) --&gt; This stock will find it's fair value by a projected PE ratio of max. 15 in 5-years. These are dummy numbers to show my way of thinking.\n\nThe second big, more important issue is the perspective of investors: - So I get 3% for a Treasuries now. Which means following: I can invest 10,000$ in a Treasury Bond and will get 300$ every year for next 10/20 years. I dont mean TLT by this. TLT is more the reverse of this. - I get 7-9% for Emerging Markets Govt Bonds (e.g. Turkey) with a duration of 10-20 years. Noted in USD. - FED will incerease the fund rate to lets say 2.5%. Which means for an investor: --&gt; Pay 2.5% + Interest charge of broker (1-1.5%). So if I go for a margin account, I pay 4% upfront when going on leverage. So the question for me here is: Can I expect 4% growth in stock value when going on margin? Which would be the break-even-point for going on margin AND the american stock market is full of margin. I should pick some stats to show this. But you guys can research here.. So I ask myself: Better on margin or cash? Why on margin, when I should pay 4% interest for holding a stock? None of the tech or S&amp;P stocks do have a PE and expected growth which legitimates the attempt to go on margin in near future (assuming that fed funds rate will be at least on 2.25 or 2.50 by end of this year of next year beginning).\n\n3rd big issue is the fact that FED will reduce the balance sheet. This will lead to another increase in Bond Yields. So the investor will ask himself: - Why risk capital on Apple, which has a PE ratio of 25, not extreme growth per share and low payout when I can own a treasury bond with a yield of 4% guaranteed for next 10-20 years? - So the investor wants a risk premium of at least 3% (this is also a historic amount). You can check and compare the difference between PE ratio of S&amp;P 500 and the treasury yields and will see that there is difference of 3% on average over past decades. - Which means following: The investor wants a 6% earnings per share now (treasury yields are at 3% now). And investor will likely to see 7% earnings when treasury yields jump to 4% (assuming this will happen within 6-12 months).\n\nYou can see the reaction in the stock market. Every time we think there is a relief rally we see big sell-off instantly. Big players are off. The Nasdaq plunged back to 6,000 in 2018/19 when FED was talking about almost no issues compared to now. I do not know the companies back then in detail and haven't researched any detail yet but there is one thing I can tell you guys: - These fucking points have no meaning. The fundametals of the companies within the index matter. From what I see now I can tell clearly that we are on the right path. We need 30% from now to rearch the All time highs again. The only scenario where this can happen in near future is: - Inflation gets back to 2% in 2024 - Interest rates get back to 2021 level in 2024 - China stops fucking up Supply Chains. - Companies will have stable earnings and growth\n\nIf these things do not happen then the only way we see all time highs is: - Companies will have growth but slower than 2021 or before that time. We will still see the all time highs but it may take us 7 or more years. Interest rates are major factor here.\n\nI would say the Nasdaq will see something like 11000 before jumping back. After seeing job market data is still perfect yesterday, we cannot await any step back from FED. But lets see inflation data next week",

    "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nGreetings you filthy animals! I'm the guy who made this [Inverse Cramer Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/) (which is beating the S&amp;P by 20% YTD, not to brag...). I asked what you wanted to see next in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/), and the top comment was a portfolio invested in stocks mentioned on South Park. So I sent my wife out for a nice date night with her boyfriend and got to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Question**\n\nCould a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Or is it?](https://i.redd.it/uw8lbkyqz1z81.gif)\n\n**The Data**\n\nI originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Strategy**\n\nBeing mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Positions**\n\n| 2000-12-13|\u2018DENN' || 2000-12-13 | \u2018DENN' || 2001-11-07 | \u2018DIS' || 2003-04-30 | \u2018CPB' |\n\n| 2004-11-03 | \u2018WMT' || 2006-10-04 | \u2018BBY' || 2008-03-19 | \u2018CHH' || 2008-04-16 | \u2018SBUX' |\n\n| 2008-10-29 | \u2018BBY' || 2009-03-11 | \u2018DIS' || 2009-03-25 | \u2018AXP' || 2009-10-07 | \u2018CMG', \u00a0'MCD', \u00a0'TWTR' |\n\n| 2009-10-21 | \u2018WWE' || 2009-11-04 | \u2018HOG' || 2010-03-24 | \u2018TWTR' || 2010-10-13 | \u2018TWTR' |\n\n| 2010-11-03 | \u2018NKE' || 2010-11-10 | \u2018NKE' || 2010-11-17 | \u2018PGR' || 2011-04-27 | \u2018AAPL', \u00a0'BBY' |\n\n| 2011-05-18 | \u2018FDX' || 2011-11-02 | \u2018Red Robin' || 2012-10-03 | \u2018WMT' || 2012-10-10 | \u2018AMZN', \u00a0'UPS' |\n\n| 2012-10-31 | \u2018NKE' || 2012-11-07 | \u2018DIS' || 2013-11-13 | \u2018SNE' || 2013-11-20 | \u2018MSFT', \u00a0'SNE' |\n\n| 2013-12-04 | \u2018MSFT', \u00a0'Red Robin' || 2014-10-15 | \u2018LYFT', \u00a0'TSLA', \u00a0'UBER' || 2014-11-05 | \u2018TWTR' |\n\n| 2014-11-12 | \u2018BBY' || 2014-12-03 | \u2018TWTR' || 2014-12-10 | \u2018TWTR' || 2015-10-14 | \u2018YELP' |\n\n| 2016-09-21 | \u2018TWTR' || 2016-09-28 | \u2018TWTR' || 2017-09-13 | \u2018TWTR' || 2017-10-11 | \u2018NFLX' |\n\n| 2017-10-25 | \u2018ROST' || 2017-11-08 | \u2018BYND' || 2017-11-29 | \u2018NFLX' || 2018-12-05 | \u2018AMZN' |\n\n| 2018-12-12 | \u2018AMZN' || 2019-10-02 | \u2018AAPL', \u00a0'DIS' || 2020-09-30 | \u2018Build-A-Bear', \u00a0'VIAC' |\n\n**The Results**\n\nUm....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Move over Cathie...](https://preview.redd.it/y9mvvf9sz1z81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787394f8282dd952b361e632aaa3466d43cb5456)\n\nSouth Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&amp;P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to \"buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic.\" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIdk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?)\n\nDespite losing my grip on reality a little, this was really fun! Let me know what strategy I should test next!\n\nP.S. Don't ask me where to invest in this. Find it yourself.",

The fund's largest long positions as of March 31 were a $22 million stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb, roughly $19 million stakes in Booking Holdings and Discovery, and a $18 million stake in Alphabet.\n\nScion didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.\n\nIt's worth noting that Burry [trumpeted Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-spotted-apple-warren-buffett-stock-investment-2021-3-1030186770?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) as a stock worthy of Warren Buffett in 1999 \u2014 about 17 years before the Berkshire Hathaway CEO invested in the company.

Average MAU for a period represent the average of the MAU at the end of each month during the period.\n\nSo the difference between MAU and mDAU is bots/spams accounts can't see ads .. Twitter is no longer reporting MAU so we don't know the ratio of MAU/mDAU but it's clearly ugly.\n\nNot to mention there's still 5% or less spam accounts in mDAU LOL\n\n&gt;We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate that the average of false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of our mDAU during the quarter.\n\nTLDR;  \nElon could be right and their calculation metric is full of shit\n\nEdit:   \nIf anyone wants to test theory just go search for any stock ticker ($SPY $AAPL $TSLA .. etc) in twitter and you'll be surprised by how many bots out there\n\nSource: Twitter earnings report 2019-2021",

Instead, we look at the tactical shots that we can apply by understanding macroeconomic events and looking for opportunities where we can grow our wealth during times of market volatility.\n\n\\*\\* Before starting i would like to apologize for the late post. I messed up my schedule because I partied a lot this Sunday. Also, there was a light cut off in my region on Monday and my laptop is a gaming one. No backup ff's. So I will make sure to add bonus content about Monday. \\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnough of my BS lets get started\u2026!!!\n\n\\*\\* Edited like 2-3 times because of spacing. I have no clue why it happened. Apologies again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good morning**\n\n**Respected Traders and Investors,**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoly shit, you're not doing well at all and are hanging by a thread at the mercy of Federal Reserve, or should i say, Joe F Biden.  XD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told you , I told you so. Victory day will be the end of \u201cBuy at the sound of cannons and sell at the noise of trumpets rally\u201d Meaning we will be making a lower low to the price which we did on Feb-march period of time. I also told you Institutions and HFs will be analyzing the CPI data and then decide if the market goes up or down. And that\u2019s the gist of what happened this week, my friends. \n\nAnd you guys must be wondering, why is this guy right every single time. How does he do that. What metrics does he look at. Well, my friends let me clarify this beforehand. I am not an expert at literally anything. Every individual across this reddit group is a more intellectual person than I am and is probably making tons of money. I\u2019m just a normal chess player who fell in love with every asset class across the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Others : White, Stock Market : Black](https://preview.redd.it/h4put00nztz81.jpg?width=5184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b09d0f8fcf0cd73e7b9d80cf5a45969a8d22565)\n\nI look at the stock market as a player in black pieces and hedge funds, institutions, and me myself as playing with white. Sometimes the stock market plays so well that we think of it as someone using stock fish engines (hence many people simply DCA index), and sometimes he plays horribly like a 100 ELO rating player. And so we all have our own theories and different perspectives on how to beat the stock market. But there is only one game that wins quickly and precisely without a single mistake or inaccuracy, thereby giving max returns and hence beating the stock market, but that game is played by the composite man using the alpha-zero engine. So the people's job in this field is to think about how the composite man might be playing with his pieces and then play their own game. They can either choose to play offensive or sometimes play defense. Hence, sometimes they beat the stock market and sometimes they don\u2019t. The movement of pieces of stock market (in black) can be analyzed by looking at technical chart.\n\nSo\n\nA) either come up with your own ideas to beat the beat the stock market by DCA index, day/swing trading, investing money in multiple value and growth stocks (lump sum/DCA)\n\nor just simply B) observe the pieces and what game is being played by other players on this field. Now this player could be your favorite YouTuber, Nancy Pelosi, some reddit guy YOLOing or any other hedge fund.\n\nIn this subreddit group, my friends, we come up with our own theories and ideas on where the USA stock market is going. By figuring out the direction where black pieces are moving beforehand, we look at the range, where it is headed and hence invest or trade money then. We also identify the risk on/off mood of the market where it could pump or dump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hence FYI : This is not financial advice. It\u2019s just my own unique style of play.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo currently my play, as you all know, is pretty simple : Build cash and DCA at key levels for the next cycle. ( when Dow Jones hits 50wMMA (min) - 200wMMA (max) or SPX hits 200wMA (min) ) But today, my friends, I'm gonna give you a short term idea for 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long intro guys. I just had to let it out. Lets now decide what\u2019s next. No need to rewind the massacre this week. We have it all covered in previous posts.

Lets analyze the problem in the market.**\n\n[Lets identify the problem.](https://preview.redd.it/6eiqjpx61uz81.jpg?width=1164&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b5cca7d3d29fffab91161a00ee9153c864d960c)\n\nDisease : Bear market.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nBare minimum : Recession ( compare it with Oct 2008, 70s-80s period )\n\nMid : Forgotten Depression  ( 1921 )\n\nMax Spread : Greater Depression  (1839, Oct 1929. Now 2019-2025. Are we in a 90yr recurring cycle? )\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nSymptoms :\n\nDownward trend with some reaction rally to upside which ultimately gets sold off.\n\nWorst performance of year since 1929 great depression.\n\nReacting to Oil prices, high inflation, Jobs/Wages data, FED interest rate talk no jutsu.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nProcedure :\n\nGod knows. All we know is that we have to avoid the max spread of the disease. The FED has to keep raising rates and expect that consumers will stop spending like crazy and bring demand inflation down. If they don't then expect a rug pull in September FOMC.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nMedical Cure :\n\n\\- FED put. (cannot work right now because we need inflation to come down first and not throw gasoline into the fire)\n\n\\- Peace b/w Ukraine and Russia or Putin needs to go.\n\n\\- China Economy opens (Cannot recommend this before peace talks because it will cause Oil shock)\n\n\\- Volcker Shock ( Should bring inflation down but bring Economic Depression )\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nSo we diagnosed the problem and the medical report says \"We are walking b/w min-mid spread of the disease\" This doesn't look good for investing purposes or HODL in 2022-2024 ( FED tightening will take 2yrs to come into effect ).\n\nSo we've got no choice other than to \"Swing trade\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Experiment : Swing trade 2022**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :**\n\n\\- A sea of red looming in Q4 2022. Most probably 3rd week of september (Quadruple witching of the worst month) or Oct 24-27 (History of crashes) due to recession looming somewhere in 2022-23 ( yield curve inversion and first -ve quarter of GDP)\n\n\\- Inflation comes down without Volcker shock.\n\n\\- Expect 75bps and get 50bps in June-July FED meetings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1 :** Look at the Nasdaq/QQQ  monthly chart and analyze it.\n\n[Chart 1 : QQQ, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT \\(O\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yeuzcvz5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efbf898f03e32971022aca9b37f5915cb8ebc708)\n\nChart 1 :\n\n\\- Stoch RSI bottom with numbers matching left and right. Meaning no significant down move possible with room for a slight leg up in the bottom, though ( like 2008 )\n\n\\- RSI has a history of bouncing b/w 40-45.\n\n\\- PVT(O) is already in the max pain accumulation zone. Meaning some big whales will be buying here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : 2008](https://preview.redd.it/y892ntx5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a03969ffdd178ef2a356a7647c5e173e9cff6c)\n\n[Chart 3 : 2022](https://preview.redd.it/pxr6bwz5lzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6a736e34b52aa460f419b846503f59e30a33f0)\n\nChart 2 &amp; 3 : Looking at 2008 and comparing with 2022. We have a lot of similarities\n\n\\- Two red candles and similar bar charts pattern.\n\n\\- Ketlner channel has a history of bounces from red zones.\n\n\\- Fib retracement bounce zone of 50% - 61.8%\n\n\\- 50wMMA is lying in the channel of fib and red zone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult: Rally starts after June fomc. Two green strong months are coming. Est : July , August.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2 :** Look at SPX/SPY monthly chart and analyze it.\n\n[Chart 1 : SPY, Indicators : Stochastic RSI, RSI, PVT\\(O\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7ajo8g3ymzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c36e599daab4afe868820d875360df2776812f2)\n\nChart 1 :\n\n\\- Stoch RSI bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- RSI at 40-45 zone. Possible chances of bounce.\n\n\\- PVT(O) not full red. Meaning not many whales are accumulating right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : 2008 + 2022](https://preview.redd.it/ig1c3l3ymzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ce46ae8d2115f973980901d13337406f3b85459)\n\nChart 2 :\n\n\\- The 19-20% drop.\n\n\\- 50wMMA can come, but there is also a probability it won\u2019t. But there is zero probability it goes straight down from here without an exit liquidity rally bounce of 2 months.\n\n\\- Ketlner red channel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult : Rally starts after June or July FOMC and gonna be volatile months. One green month is coming in August. Rally doesn't look strong in comparison to Nasdaq.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3 :** Let's look at bonds\n\n[Chart 1 : \\(1950 - 2022\\) Blue line : Bond yields , Orange line : Dow Jones , Blue line : Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/r3qgnk4lozz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1bd1e5ac4212f5814d07e1182240acaa6502a20)\n\nChart 1 :\n\n\\- Bond breakout is confirmed. Target : 4.5% min. Max (as per history) : 8-10% which sounds ludicrous right now.\n\n\\- There is no reason to believe that yields go up, then stocks go down. It just means that bonds will become more lucrative to investors and stock indices could have their volatile moves up and down. (Taking into account inflation is under control)\n\n\\- If inflation is running hot over 5% then bonds and stocks get hammered together.\n\nAlso, rising interest rates are bad for bonds. But if they are already priced in by looking at terminal rates, then it's all good. A change in terminal rates to fight hot inflation will make bonds and stocks prices fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : TLT](https://preview.redd.it/71qu7t4lozz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972c47c0740347c4d5a09a9b7ac6d714a0811150)\n\nChart 2 :\n\n\\- I have explained this chart millions of times by now. It said to start buying TLT b/w 15 may - 15 june. Well, we are now past 15. But applying bar charts cannot simply predict days.\n\n\\- Let's look at some more technical stuff :\n\na) Fib retracement from 2008 : $118 ( 61.8% ) , $101 ( 78.6% )\n\nb) Fib trend ext currently : $107 ( 1 fib ), $78 ( 1.618 )\n\n\\- We are currently touching 200 MMA and have a weekly death cross of 50 and 200 which seems to have already made the price go down like 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult : Low yield bonds with AAA safety will get bought before an economic uncertainty or financial crisis. Making stocks fall more. Hence, buy bonds in q2 and sell in q4 peak fear. Provided inflation comes down by August.\n\nIf inflation doesn\u2019t come down by September, expect bonds to get destroyed with equities or whatever asset in Q4. Volcker shock will screw everything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 4 :** Let's look at our cash. Some might say Tesla, but I say Apple because it has proven the test of time.\n\n[AAPL chart : White : 50MMA , Orange : 100MMA , Red : 200MMA. Will follow DJI](https://preview.redd.it/6dzgpq7jqzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eed1c152cde980b4092981921ab20e86f091372)\n\n4 things have been concerning me here :\n\n\\- Since the financial crisis of 2008 volume has been declining, but prices of the stock have been rising.\n\n\\- Apple is in a rising wedge and has broken a trendline. Technical target is $100 or 50 MMA. i.e., $95.\n\n\\- Apple tests 50wMMA every time stochastic RSI goes in the lower deep water region.\n\n\\- Apple's Q2 outlook wasn\u2019t good. Meaning it could fall here before the crisis comes in Q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : Apple has never made it to 100w MA since the Dotcom bubble collapse, but we all know it was a joke at that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 5 :** VIX &amp; SKEW\n\n[VIX](https://preview.redd.it/vbaanvthrzz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3ae0aac537bf645a358707a94a902342a9a2aa6)\n\nThe VIX at 50, is coming this year.\n\nIf the VIX remains elevated for a longer period of time, it would only mean more uncertainty in the market.\n\n[SKEW](https://preview.redd.it/cpref4thrzz81.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7063bf58904aa35fe515eb9ee70101f54b62a902)\n\nPuts are coming off the market, but prices are at decent lows.\n\nMeaning first an exit liquidity rally, then if people start buying more puts, you can only imagine the carnage to come later in Q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 6 :** Housing Collapse\n\n[Purple line : Housing Index, Orange : 30yr bond yields, Sky blue line : Interest rates.](https://preview.redd.it/tow6oo05szz81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f78228fc8fbf4a593e3caf0318df515183261b3d)\n\nMany people were asking why am I saying that the \u201cHousing Market\u201d will collapse in Q4. What I wanted to say was housing prices will start coming down in Q4 due to inventory build-up ( lumber prices are coming down ) , plus interest rates skyrocketing to 2% by the end of the year. The prices have rose enough and now the only way is down.\n\nThe absolute bottom of prices will be visible in 2024. But for a crash in Q4, we need a volcker shock on housing in 2022 itself. If it happens it will break the housing market. Powell promised us he wouldn't do that until August-September CPI data. So watch out for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 7 :** So we talked about money and housing. Well then let's talk about a sensitive topic called wheat. I\u2019m not here to explain where wheat is used. You guys are smart and can figure it out yourself by observing day-to day life.\n\n[Wheat Futures \\/ Average US median income](https://preview.redd.it/pwsznbtpszz81.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1d702dc3a8e09313f98f5f1208d925a138e6270)\n\nWhat I can do is plot a graph of wheat futures and divide it by our median household income. What I found was that wheat prices have been on a dramatic rise. Now what does it mean when prices go up? It means either the demand is quite high or the supply has decreased. In this case, we all know it's the latter (Ukraine + India + Russia factors).\n\nSo what does it mean ? It means food shortages are real. If America doesn't start producing enough and people keep thinking that they can flip NFTs or trade options, then we are in trouble. We cannot just assume that the other person is gonna produce things. Who knows, maybe the other person is under the same impression. This topic is subject to dispute and everyone can come up with their own case. But I thought, just let's bring this up to raise awareness among people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\n1. Buying an index is a lot safer than picking stocks at the moment because you never know. (Just told you with apple stock. 50wMMA  becould come before Q4)\n2. In Index analysis (i.e. SPY , QQQ) expect 1/2 months of green (July, August) and more profitable to buy Nasdaq because its all beaten up, bad plus historical analysis.\n3. I do not know the exact bottom in May, June. Could be much lower from here. But what I know is a rally is about to start post-FOMC in June for NASDAQ and SPX post July FOMC. I have no idea why that is an inconsistency. I\u2019m just telling you what my charts tell me.\n4. FED If - else statement\n\nIf\n\nThe FED controls inflation, then bonds buy date will be May-June period and pain for equities in Q4 where the low yield bond prices will be high as investors will turn on the safety notch to gear  (Second derivative rise in the prices of bonds could crash equity)\n\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2024)\n\nElse\n\nThe FED has no control over inflation and Volcker shocks us. Then bonds and equities get hammered together with other financial assets come Q4.\n\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2022-23)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result :** \n\nEither way. A crisis is looming for the equities market in September - October 2022, period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation :**\n\nEvery theory and experiment has an invalidation case.\n\nMy theory has just 1.\n\nIf FED breaks something in a tightening cycle which hasn't even begun yet (starts June) then we could see indices and stocks plummet more like in 2018 after FED decided to shrink its balance sheet. On average it was a 7-8% drop.\n\nQE : FED buys treasuries in the open market.\n\nQT : FED sells treasuries in the open market. (Selling is of two types. Let treasuries mature or not)\n\nHence, June is so important. We will see then, if these balance sheets selling by the FED are priced in or not by the bond market. If the answer is no, then no fake exit liquidity rally in July-August. Bond prices will fall with equities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**For this week ahead.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bloomberg Week](https://preview.redd.it/c9o3ble9yzz81.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c97a919668de5a84ca0b5fa610c7566c090beb3)\n\nMonday (Bonus) Content :\n\n\\- We had construction worker data which is a leading indicator to recession and it has never been wrong which says recession in 2023 is 10000% guaranteed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Manufacturing data from China was so bad on Monday, but don't let this fool you.

    "title": "Quick Macro Overview - the Fed is Lying to You",
    "selftext": "This is going to be relatively short and meme free, adjust expectations accordingly.\n\nOk, couple of housekeeping things first:\n\nMy post that blew up on the mortgage market got deleted by Reddit Site admins after it hit the front page because it was \"promoting hate\" - and let's be honest, I had that coming because we all know that discussing leveraged debt and equity ratios in relation to loan derivatives in intertwining markets of varying liquidity is the first of two steps that ends with you larping down the street in weird outfits.\n\nThere is still a copy of that post up you can reach by clicking on my profile if you want to read it.\n\nCongratulations to everyone that followed my Rivian puts play, the stock dropped almost 30% on May 9th with the lockup expiration as Ford sold off millions of shares.  Also, that play is over, you missed it, don't jump in now, it won't work.\n\nQuick thanks and shoutout to everyone who hit me up with tips or info about the real estate markets.  The most interesting bit I got was this:  **If you set the pre-COVID occupancy rate of NY and SF at 100%, their current commercial real estate occupancy rates as of May 11th are 38.8% and 34.6% respectively.**  These are the two most expensive real estate markets in the country.  That's a LOT of very pricey, heavily financed office and store buildings going unused.  And if you're wondering, no it's not super easy to just convert that space to residential units - the reason is you need a whole lot more plumbing and HVAC and electrical boxes/meters for residential than you do for offices, and it's not super easy to add that stuff to existing buildings.  I mean, it's doable, but it isn't fast or cheap, and often involves upgrading the lines coming into and out of the building as well as just the internal work.\n\nNow, onto the macro picture:\n\nFirst, the Fed has been lying its ass off for months now about cracking down on inflation.  They've been talking a big game since this winter about starting QT, or halting bond purchases, or any number of other things.  Look at what they're actually doing in the bond market - they're still buying billions of dollars of MBS and other bonds every day.  I believe that \"they're for sure going to actually start QT in June or July\" or whatever the next made up date is as much as I believe Biden is really going to turn student loan payments back on in August.\n\nNow, as far as the \"rate hikes\" they've been issuing?  The way the Fed raises interest rates is they increase the amount they charge banks for overnight loans.  It's gone from 0.0-0.25 to 0.75-1.0, which is a .75 basis point hike, right?  Not so fast.  Because if you'll notice, both times JPOW increased the Fed Funds Rate, he ALSO increased the ONRRP rate by the same amount.  The ONRRP is basically the banks lending the Fed money overnight and getting paid interest on it.  The current ONRRP rate is 0.8.  It went from 0.05 to 0.3 at the same time the Fed rate went from 0 to 0.25, and it went from 0.3 to 0.8 at the same time the Fed rate went from .25 to .75.  About $1.8-$1.9 trillion is going through the ONRRP every day.\n\nBasically the fed \"loans\" money to the banks at .75, then \"borrows\" it back at .8 every night.  Now it's not a 1:1 ratio, but it means that some banks are actually at negative rates right now (because they're lending money like they're paying .75 for it when they're actually paying -.05, which is a big increase in profits), while others are not.  Weirdly, it's mostly the big megabanks and wall street that are getting the extra cash out of this deal.  So strange that the guy who bought bonds himself then had the Fed buy the same bonds to drive the value of his up is also corrupt in other ways.  Total shocker.\n\n**Too complex didn't understand: the money printer never stopped going BBRRRR!! and in some ways has increased it's print run to the big boys.**\n\nFinally, the recent earnings reports are flashing giant red lights about the economy.  Home Depot and Apple had big hits, Target, Wal-Mart, and Amazon had big misses.  IE: construction, home improvement and luxury goods are doing well, but basic cheap stuff isn't.  This basically translates to the upper class and prime workforce groups are doing great, but the majority of the country who are in the lower classes are getting their asses handed to them by ever increasing food, housing, gas, and energy costs.  That's going to travel up the chain, and you'll start seeing people who upgraded to Whole Foods and iPhones over the last few years all of a sudden deciding a cheap android and wal-mart are actually perfectly fine replacements.\n\nSome positions and tickers I'm running, but if you follow you'll have a higher cost basis than I do, be aware of that.\n\n12/16 SPY 200p\n\n9/16 SPY 245p\n\n8/19 SPY 295p\n\nAs always, 90%+ of my portfolio is GME shares and leaps.\n\nI've got fair value on AMZN at around $500, and AAPL around $40, but I have no idea if they'll get that low, and if AAPL gets anywhere near that price, I have to imagine that between Buffet and their dragon's hoard of cash it would just be taken private.  They're both boomer P/E and dividend stocks that for some reason are still valued as growth tech plays.  Won't last forever, but this is a case of market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, so take care with those two in particular.\n\nGlobal food shortage this fall is shaping up to be really bad - but it's not completely locked in yet, weather pattern reversals and various other miracles could still happen - just something to keep in the back of your head when making plays.",

    "title": "Bear - Bull strategy post for this market - Be profitable or hedge against losses",
    "selftext": "Buckle up for long post. Lets get straight into the topics:\n\n**Situation: as known to many of you**\n\n1) Inflation - Peaked? Don't think so. CPI data for month of May is out to be released June 10th, placed before the FED meeting. Get out of your mom's basement and take a look at the soaring gas prices. I think, this is the highest right now for gas prices. Food and other costs does not seem to have gone down either. So we can expect another high inflation number for month of May, released in June (&gt;8%) \n\n2) In the past, only way out of SPY slump was easing the interest rates (2019 after 2018 rout, 2020, 2009 etc). Given the inflation is very high and unemployment rate is at a 50 year low, Powell will continue to stay very aggressive on the rate hikes. This is not going to be favorable for stocks. Refer to my post from months ago about effect of rate hikes to stock prices. I will probably need to recalculate the estimates in the earlier post to account for even higher rate hikes --- adjust downwards of course. \n\n**Strategy:**\n\n**Put Debit Spreads ....** yes that's it. Buying puts simply are more risky. Put debit spreads reduce premium and put a cap to the max profit. For example, when most of the market makers were jacking off to SPY rallying up to 450 back in end of March 2022 (for no reason) I bought SPY 450-440 put debit spread expiring May 20 (after FED meeting) for 2.70$ per contract. Sold those for $8.00 (\\~200% profit) at early May.... \n\n**price/expiry/spread/quantity tactics:** Buying put debit spreads when SPY is going upwards (for no reason, without positive news) is the time to buy, and HOLD. My contract value went to 2$ at some point, but I held as the reasoning was clear for me. For expiry this is best if you give 4-5 weeks for strategy to play out.  As for how big of a spread, I prefer 10, this gives maximum value of $1000 if strategy plays out. I typically try to sell at 80% profit before expiry. Quantity for you? Really depends on how much investments you got in the market and are trying to hedge. Accordingly you can buy quantity of put debit spreads contracts. \n\n**Reasoning why it works: Warning, this only works in your favor if you are invested in the market like I am (like invested in SPY, VOO, MSFT, AAPL kind of stocks). For this example lets assume about $15k of  investments in large cap, small cap, stocks/funds.** \n\nScenario 1)Market declines: If the market declines 5% (which constantly keeps happening) you are down 750$. Now at the same time, towards expiry the put debit spread has gained in value and closer to maximum profit of 730$ (assuming a 10 point spread like 450-440 SPY, bought at 2.70$ per contract).... Note the spread gains value towards 1000$ very close to expiry, suggestion is to sell at 80% profit. In this case you will be up .8\\*730 = $584. Hence this minimizes the overall losses to 750-584$ = 166$. \n\nScenario 2) Market is up 5%: This rarely happens these days...Even if it does stay up while the put debit spread is expiring, your investments are up 5% by 750$. And assume put debit spread gone to 0$, expiring worthless... in this case you are up by 750-270 = 480$. \n\nScenario 3) Market stays flat....this is never the case in these times. Even if it does, this is why it is beneficial to buy the spreads atm (at the market) price and not deep OTM. This way if strategy doesn't play out, you can still time the highs and lows in the days putting a limit order. \n\n**Why this strategy and not just DCA?**\n\nThere is a legitimate and serious concern that SPY may go to 300-350$ in the coming months if it hits bear markets. More of not \"if\" but rather \"when\" it hits.  I do not want to run the risk of losing my investments by such a large percentage, and hence hedging seems to be the best option at the moment. Of course keep cash on the side and invest as it allows. And, given the conditions, buying these spreads and selling at 50-80% profits seems to be the best strategy. \n\nPositions: SPY 400-390 Put debit spread expiring June 21st (why? this is after CPI data and FED meeting, although I feel FED meeting may not cause much issue, as Powell announces everything upfront). Bought at $3.21 per contract, already up 60% as of right now). \n\nThere is a good chance of bull run to 420$, could add more if that happens. I wish it happens really and these debit spreads goes to ZERO..... I will be more happy to see my investments go up and not worry about hedging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my post from 4 months back for interest rate hikes projecting this market downturn with price targets: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdb3qh/rate\\_hikes\\_and\\_how\\_it\\_affects\\_stocks\\_watching\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdb3qh/rate_hikes_and_how_it_affects_stocks_watching_for/)",

    "selftext": "Yes the pre market is green.  Yes that's happened dozens of times just to get pummeled from 9:45 until 4:00.\n\nHere's the problem.  One thing that is certain and undeniable is that when the mega caps tank, the market tanks.  See: Netflix, Amazon, fb, tsla demise.  When those stocks lose support it shakes the entire market and we bleed out in impressive fashion. \n\nThe death of nflx, fb, amzn and tsla got us to where we are.  The death of aapl, goog, and msft will get us to where we're heading.  Spy 360....the 200 MA.  \n\nAll 3 sank Friday below the bottom of a key trendline and closed directly below that line for the first time.  All 3.  Right below.  First time.\n\nNow spy is above its trendline but you can bet your ass its not going anywhere without those 3.  All 3 are butted up against the bottom of their trendline line in the premarket.   Watch them carefully.   Maybe its possible they just undercut the line and they soar today.  I highly doubt it.   They are the last of the megas holding up and they're charts are breaking down but have a long way to go.  Amzn, fb, and Netflix hit pre covid levels already as has damn near every other stock except the aforementioned 3 holding this shit pile up. \n\nWe need them up substantially early...like 1.5% to 2% and to hold for any chance of a rally.  They fade to red and short anything became it'll all follow suit bigly.",

    "selftext": "China\u2019s industrial output fell 2.9% in April from a year ago, while retail sales fell 11.1% as the country\u2019s harsh lockdowns took their toll on the economy. While the output from the mining and utilities sectors increased, manufacturing output declined by 4.6%. The auto and equipment-manufacturing sectors have been worst affected by these lockdowns \u2014 resulting in even more shortages around the world.\n \nUnemployment rates in major cities also rose, which contributed to the drop in retail sales. Economists are now lowering their forecasts for China\u2019s economic growth for the year, with some saying they believe the economy may already be entering a recession. \n \nThe interruption to manufacturing is also affecting global companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  and Toyota (NYSE:TM), who have manufacturing operations in China. Foreign companies are now reducing their investments in China, and some are even considering relocating their operations elsewhere, according to a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Besides the Covid-related lockdowns, businesses are also concerned about geo-political issues and China\u2019s close relationship with Russia.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/china-economy-covid-lockdowns-weigh-on-retail-industrial-production-data.html\n\nAAPL may get into 120s to enter for long term.\n\nTSLA may be a free fall, if it misses revenues/profits. lol\n\nWhat y\u2019all think?",

    "selftext": "*edit: yes this is a conspiracy post to make you vote for bidden. You got me. Bravo.*\n\n**TLDR**\n\nInteresting  \"blended user portfolio\" from this newsletter I receive, shows a  combination of oversold tech/\\[forbidden word\\] and traditional defensive  positions. Also, LOL for the \"collar\"...\n\nJokes aside, this is interesting insofar as it can have some convexity:\n\n* **Bull case**: Tech is heavy oversold will rebound, treasuries are not expensive and will stay flat\n* **Bear case**: Treasuries and Gold (and defensive equities) can offset further falls in riskier assets\n\nWhich  points to a very interesting situation: the classic risk parity  portfolio has been destroyed and it's heavily oversold. Even Gold is  heavy down. Any moderately less hawkish fed news might snap Treasuries  and S&amp;P 500 up strong.\n\n**THE PORTFOLIO**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lbz9a6ldm191.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2967d75fa463e69af3a099c2aaf46c92199d4eef\n\n**FULL TEXT**\n\n&gt;TL;DRInvestors  are responding to the downturn in many ways. Here is a list of the most  common approaches we hear when talking with other TOGGLE users.Also remember that Fed Minutes come out today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5lwwn6odm191.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcc80f0b68e76bbf708d64e9f6f619a37d71c2ff\n\n&gt;**The** **Treasury Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The safe-haven investor is going all-in into Treasuries. They believe that the Fed will be able to hike only so much and are happy to get \\~3% from 10y US Treasuries and \\~3% implied inflation from TIPS.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Staples Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Remember when Walmart rallied in Q4 of 2008? The Staples Investor remembers. This investor is pivoting to safe equities like staples, real estate, utilities and possibly energy. Recession or not, we need to eat, to rent and to turn on the lightbulbs. See you at the next recovery, they are confident they will be up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dividend Seeker**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dividend Seeker is close in style to the Staples investor. With a nice drop in markets, dividends are becoming compelling again and the Dividend Seeker is looking for 4%+ dividends to weather the storm  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Call Underwriter**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Call Underwriter owns a portfolio of equities and sells calls against it. Like the Dividend Seeker, they want yield. They do not believe equities will appreciate during the downturn, and seek the extra carry provided by selling premium.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Tech Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Tech Investor is the new incarnation of the Staples Investor. Maybe 20 years ago Walmart was the safe choice, but the Tech Investor believes that now it\u2019s Big Tech that is a safe choice. AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT are all infrastructure plays and they\u2019re here to stay.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Short Seller**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The short seller believes in doom and gloom and will use inverse ETFs or even put options to stay short the market. \u201c*The downturn has just begun, just wait till QT starts!*\u201d said one of our most bearish users.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note: QT is Quantitative Tightening, the unwind of QE.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Cash Hoarder**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Cash Hoarder thrived in a time of low inflation and reasonable real rates. Now they are facing a real challenge as real rates for short term bonds are deeply negative, and they are thinking maybe about moving to Japan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note \u2018cash\u2019 here is used as a synonym for T-Bills of 3M or lower tenor.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dollar Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dollar Bull knows how markets work during a recession. When the global economy falters, money flows back to the big ole US of A. The Dollar Bull is not unlike the cash hoarder, but they have a cross-currency view of things - and will pounce back on oversold foreign holdings one day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull has discovered that a popular asset class cannot escape correlation with the equity market. After \\[forbidden word\\] suffered yet another 60% drop from peak, the \\[forbidden word\\] investor is eyeing that $29.7k level from July 2021 and thinking \u201cwill it breach or rebound?\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**he Gold Bug**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Gold Bug knows that the precious metal is where the buck stops. Come hell or high water, recession or inflation, Gold is the ultimate safe haven. Russia war? High inflation? Recession? Gold is the answer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Conclusion**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many valid approaches to invest for safety during a slowdown. If we blend together all these styles we get a defensive portfolio made of Treasuries, High Dividend / Defensive stocks, Gold, some \\[forbidden word\\] and a collar (i.e. a sold call and a long put).",

But as I noted in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uu6hc6/if_pelosi_cant_beat_this_market_what_hope_do_we/), Nancy has had a disappointing reversion to the mean after several years of outperformance.

But it's up to me to figure out how to get our dear Speaker back on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The New Strategy**\n\nIf the opposite of Pro is Con, then the opposite of progress is... This is the kind of high level logic I used to determine where ole Nancy wen't wrong. Surely she's getting insider information from companies, but she has to mask that with some garbage trades (probably sourced from WSB). How can we identify  the good trades from the bad?\n\nLocation, location, location.\n\nPelosi is a powerful figure in California and Washington D.C. It makes sense that she would be connected with companies headquartered in those states. The tech giants of Silicon Valley and legacy companies headquartered in D.C. that keep Congress' pocketbooks full in exchange cost-plus government contracts. **So I made a new Pelosi tracking strategy that follows her trades, but ignores any companies headquartered outside California and D.C.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Results**\n\nThat's more like it! This Pelosi tracker is back on top with a 50% outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 in the past 2 years. Even with the massive drawdown to start 2022, Pelosi would be killing it in the market if she just stuck with the companies she's connected to.\n\nCorrelation with the S&amp;P \u2014 73.51%  \nAnnualized Volatility \u2014 54%  \nSharpe Ratio \u2014 2.4 ([calculation](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/sharpe-ratio-definition-formula/#:~:text=Sharpe%20Ratio%20%3D%20(Rx%20%E2%80%93%20Rf)%20%2F%20StdDev%20Rx&amp;text=Rf%20%3D%20Risk%2Dfree%20rate%20of,portfolio%20return%20(or%2C%20volatility)))  \nMax Drawdown \u2014 67.5%  \nAnnual Return since 2020 \u2014 7.87%\n\n**Positions**\n\nAAPL, AMZN, CRM, DIS, FB, GOOGL, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, PYPL, RBLX, V\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v49g3gk003391.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9720d3aaaf89d0d314d8c5affe765992d550e57",

I think we hit the market bottom so I am personally all in on FNGG.  What is interesting are the holdings:\n\nI like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:\n\nI would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.\n\nAt the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction.

    "title": "Warren Buffett says these are the best stocks to own when inflation spikes \u2014 with consumer prices still surging, it's time to follow his lead - $CXV $AAPL $KO $AXP",
    "selftext": "[https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffett-says-these-are-the-best-stocks-to-own-when-inflation-spikes](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/warren-buffett-says-these-are-the-best-stocks-to-own-when-inflation-spikes)\n\nPrice levels continue to rise at a rate we haven\u2019t seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% \u2014 down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs.\n\nSpiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.\n\nFortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has [plenty of advice](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/5-top-quotes-from-berkshire-hathaways-shareholder-meeting) on what to own when consumer prices spike.\n\nIn a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.\n\nHere are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.\n\n## American Express (AXP)\n\nLast year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.\n\nThe company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.\n\nAmerican Express makes most of its money through discount fees \u2014 merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.\n\nBusiness is booming. In Q1, the company\u2019s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion.\n\nAmerican Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire\u2019s stake is worth nearly $24 billion.\n\nBerkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.\n\nAmerican Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%.\n\n \n\n## Coca-Cola (KO)\n\nCoca-Cola is a classic example of a [recession-resistant](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/jim-rogers-warns-big-collapse-and-recession) business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.\n\nThe company\u2019s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands \u2014 including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater \u2014 give it plenty of pricing power.\n\nAdd solid geographic diversification \u2014 its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.\n\nBuffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late \u201980s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion.\n\nYou can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.\n\n \n\n## Apple (AAPL)\n\nNo one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.\n\nEarlier last year, management revealed that the company\u2019s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones.\n\nWhile competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don\u2019t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.\n\nToday, Apple is Buffett\u2019s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple\u2019s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%.\n\nApple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.\n\n \n\n## Chevron (CVX)\n\nOne of Buffett\u2019s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 \u2014 a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nToday, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.\n\nOil \u2014 the most heavily traded commodity globally \u2014 has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by [Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/ukraine-invasion-protect-your-portfolio) could keep that trend going.\n\nStrong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron\u2019s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022.\n\nThe company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%.",

More confirmation of a major reversal coming, even if it's the 1 minute chart.\n\nWhen the prices were closing on Friday, the price action of all the stocks freaked me out. There were several anomalies that made me [exit all my AAPL call positions:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vjxutl/a_modest_3k_gain_in_3_days_from_11k_to_14k_this/)\n\n1. All stocks across the board exhibited consolidation, which is normally quite bullish, but not all stocks had the same pattern.\n2. The volume was too consistently high for a lot of them.\n3. There was actually too little volatility that day for my liking.\n\nPut those points together, and there is actually a good chance that players were getting out of the game and exiting, instead of accumulating.\n\nSo out of impulse, in addition to closing my my positions, I took a small risk and bought some 0DTE SPY puts 388 strike.\n\n[Also picked up some GME shares 'cause the price action was really weird.

Low volume still, consider it consolidation at the lows, we should be going lower soon. Unless, of course, I'm completely wrong. I could be wrong if the price crosses that green line.

This is what a bear would want to see. If there were signs of a bull trap, these would be it. And IF it is a bull trap, this would make tomorrow all the more red.

But if you want to know a secret, I am seeing hints of bearish divergence, both regular and hidden \\(if you know what that means\\).

We can see that it's starting to get volatile, in the downward direction. If it were volatile going up for that last candle, I would've said bullish short term.

This is it, there's no coming back. Based on previous price action, 1\\) high volatility after major pumps, 2\\) on low volume, 3\\) a more massive manipulated pump, 4\\) immediate downward volatility consolidating at low fib lines, 5\\) waterfall drop, the chance of us returning to make highs from here is extremely unlikely.

This is usually a pretty bullish signal. However, the price action isn't volatile enough in the downward direction for me to believe it. Will have to see what happens.](https://preview.redd.it/rwjr2zx574891.png?width=2650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=848b5ff74945736fa76ef8cdf83320ceb34add3f)\n\n**Edit 16 (Update 3:46am):**\n\n[Looks like the high-volume candles keep coming in, and we have pushed beyond the old local high breaking the double top.

    "selftext": "**Recap On Yesterdays Market Action:**\n\n* SPY closed down 0.81%\n* QQQ closed down 1.24%\n* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.82%\n* VIX closed up 1.95%\n\nToday market the end of the first half of 2022. The S&amp;P 500 had its worse first half of a year since 1970 and the Nasdaq had its worst start ever. Year to date (YTD) the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 21.03% and the Nasdaq 30.34%. The current market is attempting to rally but is under severe strain and may fall back down to the previous lows. It is hard to be either long or short because of the whipsaw action like todays mini rally and subsequent selloff.\n\n[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/ordaxm278y891.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71def4283a483b840da6e52f6f0a5ba38d69ca6e)\n\nSPY gapped down and opened about 1.00% off of yesterdays lows. We then proceeded to see a selloff of approximately 0.75% before rallying to reach the 8 EMA (red line). If this mini rally would have held the market action would have actually been quite productive. Instead SPY sold off after reaching the 8 EMA and closed only slightly up from the open, about 0.25%. Today was slightly helpful for the market rally but not by much, the fact that SPY was able to somewhat hold its ground was good to see. There was also an increase in volume compared to the last few days.\n\n[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/2pawcvv78y891.png?width=2262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a580449c99bee81129718786dc9bc3bd2aa2f871)\n\nQQQ behaved very similarly to SPY but closed below its open for the day. This is nothing out of the ordinary for 2022 since QQQ has been hit harder during this bear market. Currently, QQQ and SPY are both approximately 2.60% from their lows for the year, so one rough day could trigger new lows and a new wave fo selling.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nI am not currently in any positions and am sitting in cash. I will be looking to go short if QQQ breaks below its lows for the move. I will also be looking to go long if SPY breaks Wednesdays highs. Heavy volume either direction will be needed for this trade to trigger. Ideally we would see a large increase in daily volume if either of these positions trigger.\n\n**Potential Setups:**\n\nBesides the potential with SPY and QQQ there are very few stocks setting up with high probability patterns.\n\n[AAPL Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qsrdmsv88y891.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d0ea7a3eb989248258b400e62ca352c98f1bcfc)\n\nAAPL is forming a potential higher low setup. The low set today is higher than the low set around the 22nd of June. This setup looks promise because of todays price action closing near the highs of the day after retreating nearly 2.30% during the day. It is important to note that no setup is 100% foolproof, as we can see from earlier in the year on this chart where a higher low failed. These type of setups should also only be bought if the market is in good condition and rising, especially on megacap stocks like Apple that make up a large portion of SPY and QQQ holdings.\n\n[AMZN Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/uqsj58t98y891.png?width=2250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb2e773159260097d587b6a2f3b33f36ecacbfc5)\n\nAMZN has also formed a higher low similarly to AAPL. With this setup the lows are much closer together in terms of price. This may not affect the potential of this trade working but means that a small negative move will quickly invalidate the setup. Both stocks have the potential to trigger but need to have a strong market as well and large volume come through the buy points as they take out todays highs.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nThere are very few slam dunk setups forming, although there are several higher lows that may prove promising. With this weekend being a 3 day weekend we may see low volume tomorrow. This is not the worst that could happen as a calm day may give the market a chance to relax. It is also not the best idea to go on a large buying spree tomorrow as this market is very news driven and may react sharply in either direction. If the indices or individual stocks trigger, only buy a small portion of your initial position so if a quick reversal happens it is not as damaging.",

    "title": "Former Apple exec tasked with enforcing insider trading rules admits to insider trading",
    "selftext": "Apple\u2019s former senior director of corporate law and corporate secrecy has officially admitted to partaking in an insider trading scheme. Gene Levoff was first indicted for insider trading in 2019, and while he was initially fighting the charges, he has now admitted to his role in these insider trading transactions.\n\nLevoff started at Apple in 2008 and served as a senior director of corporate law from 2013 until 2018. The trades in question were made between 2011 and 2016, the indictment says.\n\nAs reported by Law360, Levoff has admitted to misappropriating nonpublic information about Apple\u2019s financial information; he would then use this information to make trades with Apple stock. In total, the scheme allowed Levoff to generate $227,000 in profit and avoid $377,000 in losses.\n\nWhen Levoff would know that Apple had strong revenue and net profit for a given financial quarter, he would purchase large quantities of AAPL stock and sell it once the rest of the market reacted to the news.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, this case is incredibly ironic: one of Levoff\u2019s responsibilities at Apple included enforcing the company\u2019s insider trading policy. In fact, he even informed Apple employees about a trading blackout period for AAPL stock, while also buying and selling the stock himself.\n\nThe details of the punishment Levoff will face are still unclear, but each count in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2022/06/30/former-apple-exec-admits-to-insider-trading/",

However, the Dow isn\u2019t as important as the Nasdaq or S&amp;P 500 but I include it in these write ups just to be complete. Today\u2019s price action was very constructive towards the overall market rally as it showed that early selling was quickly overpowered with buying. Even with today ending positive it is still a time to be cautious and limit exposure, especially since FOMC minutes are being released tomorrow. Typically when there is a Fed announcements the markets are quiet and tend to have low volume until the announcement is over.\n\n[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/64utvdihxx991.png?width=2252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1a2a1e85e72fb3921fece86dc5fee2653426512)\n\nSPY gapped down 1.40% to start the day and continue to drop and undercut Fridays lows. Volume dried up after breaking the lows and we did not see anymore downside. SPY then rallied throughout the rest of the day to close above Fridays highs. Volume today was slightly higher than Fridays but was still lower than than the 50 day moving average. Overall today was still productive towards the general market rally.\n\n[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/hjm5xv0ixx991.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b174bcc9a18d525447571346e2f74540885f997)\n\nQQQ gapped down 1.10%, slightly less than SPY, and quickly gained back is losses and closed well above Fridays highs. There was also an increase in volume but still below the 50 day moving average. QQQ also closed above the 8 day EMA (red line). Overall QQQ had a much stronger day than SPY and may be looking to mover higher in the next few days.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nSSO opened approximately 2.20% lower than Friday and continued to drop. I sold half of my position as SSO broke below Fridays lows. I then sold my remaining shares as SSO approached Thursdays lows. Looking back now it would have been nice to hold but there was no way of knowing that in the moment.\n\nAs we broke into new highs I opened two new positions in both QLD and AMZN. QLD is a doubly leveraged ETF tracking the Nasdaq 100. I made two buys as QLD advance into new highs to avoid buying all of my shares at once. I also bought AMZN since it appeared to be acting stronger than other stocks\n\n**Potential Setups:**\n\nSince I am in two positions I will mainly be monitoring those and looking to add on the my existing shares.\n\n[AAPL Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/th4lubtixx991.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015310bc6bff9cb2eae0fe53fa8678ae37cdfa61)\n\nHowever, if AAPL is able to break its recent high I would consider adding a small position. Breaking these highs would be another trigger showing the higher low setup is working.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nYesterday was a constructive day in the overall market rally. We still have a long way to go but have to start somewhere. If you decide to buy stills in the rally do so in small quantities and be sure to cut losses quickly. The worst this you could do is to go large, there are better times than now to go all in.",

Google is selling their new phone at a fixed price in Euros, and they have not increased that price. So did Apple with their iphones. An Iphone 13 is 899\u20ac and 6 months ago that would mean 1029 USD, while now it is just 907 USD. So basically the money Apple are getting for each phone sale have dropped with 14% in the last 6 months.\n\nI think this is not priced in the earnings calculations and estimations. I know a lot of phones are sold in the US, but any market outside will have their margins wacked because of the currency.\n\nSo, long story short, companies that have sticky prices and are selling a lot to Europe will get hurt more than expected.\n\nPosition AAPL120p29.7",

    "selftext": "Alright dickheads, I'm back.  A lot of you told me I was retarded last weekend when I called out the divergences that led into this rally, so to them I say Fuck You \n\nFor everyone else, here's what I'm seeing in the charts, if you're into that sorta thing.\n\n**SPY:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp44b7g01ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44f2b518fbe0f3da341b79eebe6a61892e2f6a49\n\nStill have some work to do if we're going to fill that $400 gap.  Rejecting $390 this week may have some of you concerned but checkout the Weekly chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kr4hpb092ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f328e839d8338c56b295d2fb5eaad9475b20bca9\n\nThis weekly chart just further outlines the trend reversal that the daily divergences have been showing leading into this rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QQQ:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xigs6v63ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b21aa5cff8d8d35acb8c7c6c382e2146a93c5dee\n\nGoing to use QQQ this week because some of you are so smooth-brained that you didn't know there were any other NASDAQ ETF's and were so proud of yourselves trying to call me out about it.\n\nAnyway, looks like we've officially broken out of this falling wedge thanks to the big guys waking up (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT), the others are close behind.  I'd be looking for the $300 gap to fill leading into CPI, then a pullback because it's fucked, possibly down to around $285 support, maybe lower.  Ideally I'd be looking for re-entry / entry / adding to longs at a completed back-test of the trendline we just broke this week.  Regardless of what the Fed does this month, this rally has some legs and will continue for a while, or so the technicals are indicating...\n\nFor context of the reversal manifesting in the Weekly charts, QQQ's look just like SPY \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1hg8thp2ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ff23ad7fe76267e16139bdc1f522c1b3dda2932\n\n**CPC**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ps3gi8w4ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc85e8cf9c1704b2233e1b62c3e7c18bff8134f0\n\nHere's a quick look at the put/call ratio, focus on the blue line (9-day MA).  Notice how June 14th we put in a lower high which coincides with the higher low in the indices this week, then crossing down below the 0.95 line breaking trend and confirming that people are becoming more bullish on the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10Y**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s10fttq16ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d685f1cc31199945aca3240ca54df8d0acc62b\n\nStill inside this rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence in the PPO and somewhat in the RSI.  Will still need to wait it out but it looks like a reversal is coming in both the 10 and 2 year, keeping in mind, we're STILL inverted since like Thursday of last week.\n\nLet's talk BANKS since we're coming up on earnings next week!\n\n**BAC:  Earnings 7/18**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58ma3p1f8ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc928df6038897136505e52b56ce61ed524752a4\n\nBank of America has been in this falling wedge for a while and has recently started to show some bullish divergence in the RSI, not so much in the PPO though.  I think we have a pretty solid floor under us at around $31 which was resistance back in 2019.  We have a gap just above some potential resistance around $34 which I think we hit easily, will deal with the gap when we get there.\n\n**JPM:  Earnings 7/14**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsz06oej9ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab06934305b15c42978ca614eaf8f5808cfddb7\n\nJP Morgan Chase!  \nJP Morgan Chase!  \nJP Morgan Chase!  \nJPM has also been inside this falling wedge for a while with a bit better defined bullish divergence.  Again a solid floor under us with a nice rejection off of a previous gap left open since Nov. 2020.  Overhead resistance at $117.50-ish I think will be pushed through pretty easily and likely won't see much push back from the bears until the $125 gap.\n\n**GS:  Earnings 7/18**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r68xe8pnaha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0192b4927c8aa6793a16e89c8c6d94c5b29dd6\n\nI think I'm less confident in this one.  The falling broadening wedge is bullish but I'm not seeing as solid footing as the others at this point, we're kind of in the middle of support/resistance right now and the divergences in the RSI and PPO aren't really as convincing as JPM.\n\n**VIX**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85h8p64abha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5767b1fb31bcea6b4c71c31b66f28aa58f36e553\n\nYah, so what, i do TA on the VIX, wanna fight about it?\n\nShowing the 1-hr chart on this one to keep everyone on their toes.  Today we fell out the bottom of this falling wedge with bullish divergence still intact on the RSI, BUT burned through on the PPO, hopefully that trend continues into the PPO.  Lately the money glitch has been buy puts at VIX $25, buy calls at VIX $35 and I'm here to tell you that didn't work today.\n\nKeep an eye on this bastard though, if it claws its way back into this wedge then look for a big fat stinky dump shortly there after.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think Bond investors are flooding into equities right now so we're likely going to see continuation of this rally much to the perma-bear's chagrin.  I wouldn't get too comfortable though if you're long because at any moment they could decide to flood back into bonds as a safe haven, it really depends on that the Fed does at the July FOMC, till then however, I'll be buying the dip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other tickers you retards wanna see, let me know.  I'm planning to do big tech next weekend.",

Quick question that I\u2019m guessing will not have a straightforward answer.  \n\nI have treated my brokerage account as my main savings account where I can do small scale trades and grow it a little as a hobby.  \n\nNow I\u2019m moving into a phase where I\u2019m preparing to buy a house in the next 6-9 months.  Most of my money is in tech like TSLA, AMC, AAPL, and a couple others.  They are down pretty dramatically from the time I bought them, but the value of my account would still cover a down payment.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the market being down in a long term play, but like everyone I\u2019m uneasy about the economy and the inflation we\u2019re experiencing.  I\u2019m trying to decide if I should take the losses and get my money into a safer location so that I can buy my house without the risk of losing my down payment to a crash, or if I should leave it in for another few months and see what happens.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "selftext": "First of all, I hope everyone had a good day today.\n\nNow this won't be that technical, because I am not a smart man. I wouldn't be here if I was. But this morning as I was watching $SPY and looking at my puts go up in price at open I was happy for about 5 minutes and then watched as they flipped and went back down. I was watching my list and trying to figure out why this is happening. Probably like most people here, or at least the other people who are highly regarded like me.\n\nWell I found it, partly from other people smarter then me pointing it out. But I did a little work hitting print screen and making some pictures everyone can look at.\n\n[So this was $SPY today.](https://preview.redd.it/j15efj8mygb91.jpg?width=2934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57b33aba4c6841f4a17a4fd8068cf32dcc0d8c4)\n\nNow for the smart people here they know that $SPY is a bunch of different stocks bundle up into one stock people can trade. So if all the stocks in that ETF are doing bad then the ETF will go down. This will also cause it to go up if they are all doing good. Pretty simple right? Well it's not that simple, but it will work for what I am trying to get across.\n\nSo $SPY is an ETF and is made up of a bunch of stocks and those stocks are bunched up into sectors and they are weighted by how much $SPY has invested in each one. The biggest/heaviest one is for technology and you can look it up under $XLK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here I did it for you, this is today.](https://preview.redd.it/kzt8so430hb91.jpg?width=2962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff161fdb9f1abdcc7c6dc1b587cef170e4ef43bc)\n\nIf you wanna check out the full list you can see it here.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/)\n\nIf you don't check it out I will break it down real fast for you.\n\nTech 24.17%\n\nHealthcare 15.17%\n\nFinancial Services 12.92%\n\nConsumer Cyclical 10.28%\n\nCommunication Services 8.84%\n\nThere is other stuff but I am lazy, just click the link and check for yourself.\n\nSo back to $XLK and why it's important. In this group of stocks are a few everyone here knows. But the one I wanna talk about is $AAPL which is 5.90% of the total assets $SPY has invested. That is not just under the tech umbrella, that is everything. It might not seem like a big deal when you see $MSFT is 5.60% of $SPY's assets. But trust me that .30% is a big deal. Here take a look at this chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Does this look pretty familiar to you?](https://preview.redd.it/ub1ux4qe2hb91.jpg?width=2984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1a805de3adf6be9b17a31ff57be4e4cd10d977)\n\nDid you just do a double take? I know I did this afternoon when I was looking at it. This is $AAPL holding up $XLK which is helping hold up $SPY. Another thing to check out is this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I hate $AAPL.](https://preview.redd.it/0z8a1nd43hb91.jpg?width=695&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e082b16b211bcae41a77fc1399cbd3b9870e84)\n\nThat is pretty much it, I already hated Apple for how they treat their customers and force you to stay in their ecosystem. Now I hate them because they are making my puts bleed.\n\nI Hope everyone has a good night and hopefully you learned something.",

Well apparently chinese people are dying to buy iphones. They are literally killing each other to get an iphone. \n\nBut wait. Isn\u2019t the asian market known to always want the best product configuration available for the cheapest price? I.e their iphones have dual sim slot, their androids have the fastest processors. While in the west people are happy with what they get. \n\nLet\u2019s look at apple today and their future line up. Their core business is still the iphone, their next line up iphone 14 will have the old. A15 chip that\u2019s already in the iPhone 13. \nTheir new macbook air base model 256gb has a 30-40% slower ssd than the last generation but with a rougly 30% price spike. You really think the asian market is gonna buy any of these products?\n\nWhy would apple do that? Why are they selling the new air with old ssd and a huge price? Well they are sitting on a huge inventory not able to sell those parts off so they have to recycle them as long as possible. \n\nWhat are the possible outcomes: \n1. Apple beats earnings by 10%: dump incoming as people expected more and it was already priced in\n2. Apple earnings estimates are correct: huge dump incoming\n3. Apple misses earnings estimates completely: astronomical dump incoming \n\nTldr: Smart money is putting out rumors so they can dump their stack on retail.

Apparently my one play I spoke on, $YANG, decided to go up 50% within a week on slowing China economic news I thought was priced in already. I decided to give it another shot with my 3 brain cells on the Chinese domain of Reddit.\n\n\\*\\*NOTE: Reports out of China are notoriously fudged a little to make the nation look better. Look at the numbers as an overall view of what is occurring within China.  \n\n# Economic Problems\n\nFor the sake of my brain cells, I will assume everyone knows about the set up of China\u2019s Housing and their financial Crisis. \n\nLocal and provincial Governments incomes depended on the land sales which in turn would create more infrastructure with debts attached to the banks. With the halt, many provincial governments are financially crippled with **hidden debts suspected to be up to 50% of Nationwide GDP** ( [LINK](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160566/chinas-hidden-corruption-problem-behind-local-debts-goes-hand?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article&amp;campaign=3160566)) . The government positions are being demanded to voluntarily **cut salaries of up to 30%**  in wake of the crippling debt ([link](http://chinascope.org/archives/29979)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2018 IMF Report on China Debts ([link](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18219.ashx))\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/l2034lkri1c91.png?width=1924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e7e87d5942ff4fd8c3ce14819075a140e5c20bd)\n\nIncreasing Debt to GDP from [bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-06/china-s-debt-to-climb-to-record-in-2022-government-adviser-says) too cheap to pay for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bh40aoqxk1c91.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1ad51969a09933c5b41f59586902fb9e1f08997)\n\nChina\u2019s banks are deeply intertwined with local governments. Many banks offered retarded investment packages instead of actual bank accounts to citizens. These investment packages either included the suspicious provincial government\u2019s land rights as debt or were outright scams. Consequently many citizen\u2019s money were not picked up by China's main bank. With zero liquidity, banks closed online access and became really hostile to anyone who was asking for their money. The subsequent bank runs are creating unprecedented demonstrations to force the regulatory commission to release frozen funds ([link](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/banking-waves-china-release-frozen-bank-funds-after-rural-protests-203568)). These bank runs are deeply systematic and need government intervention and will no doubt cause further strain on Chinese incomes. \n\nSpeaking about their infrastructure projects, their water dams are partially to blame for the massive floods throughout China. China currently has thousands of Dams, both active and abandoned. Some active Dams are in deep disrepair due to lack of provincial resources([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07136-0)). With increased rainfall reported throughout the region, the integrity of these Dams are threaten. These officials will suddenly open the flood gates to claim no fault. These floods are specifically pushed towards the rural towns and destroying food production in the South. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese food shortages are recognized by the Government. China implemented a Great Leap Forward in food production by forcing local governments to make more food([link](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-seed-industry-seeks-better-laws-support-innovation-318341)). China is also encouraging citizens to limit food waste through either subtle messaging or ordering restaurants to limit the amount of food given. \n\nFood Shortages have been compensated by the increased import of food. China currently projects to import **100 Million Metric Tons of SOYBEANS** from the Global Market ([link](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/060722-china-climate-change-food-security)). This and other crops imports will increase despite China\u2019s policies to increase local food production and limit food waste. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2020 USDA Report on China's increasing food [imports](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/t7a72lkzn4c91.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c7ddd2b939396236acfda0904a81e3474a5592)\n\nEven if the invasion never happens, a ticking time bomb is occurring with the NYSE investigation on China companies audits with even $BABA not passing scrutiny ([link](https://fortune.com/2022/07/08/us-china-companies-stock-exchange-listing-audit-papers/)). These Reports indicate many Chinese companies will be de-listed from the NYSE by 2024 without China giving into demands. \n\n# Big Elections in November 2022\n\nWhile Xi removed political term leadership limits in 2018, he still needs to look good for his people. Their \u201celection\u201d is in November with numerous concerns of fighting off his political Rivals. The humiliation he has been experiencing with his COVID Zero Policy and his Trade War with Australia and USA has been damaging to China economically. \n\nXi is unlikely to lose however he does need to show strength within his party soon. He needs a solution that can give him absolute control over the country when you cannot simply print expensive infrastructure bills and ignore rural workers. \n\n# Their Solution? Taiwan. (But not what you think)\n\nNothing brings people together like a time of war.\n\n**(Insert American Patriotic Theme)**\n\nWe all know the memes and shit posting. We also know China has significantly increased military spending for the past two decades ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China)). However people believe that China will simply attempt to blitz over the 180km strait to invade without a plan. I suspect China will want a quick victory that the West will hopefully ignore and give the Party including Xi a propaganda win at home. \n\nI do not believe Taiwan itself is in immediate trouble, its islands it controls nearby China are in trouble. Taiwan\u2019s Kinmen islands are less than 10km (6 miles) from China\u2019s shore. Recently China has been increasingly harassing Taiwan by invading their airspace([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-chinese-military-is-flying-more-combat-aircraft-near-taiwan-2022-7)).  This required Taiwan to respond with their air force in a fight of maintenance attrition from Taiwan repairing their planes. I would not be surprised if it's a psychological tactic similar to some bargain brand Operation Desert Storm. \n\nStolen Picture from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China). \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pguotg3lk1c91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755a84e0bd8eca1f0580c0e36069e11bd40b007c)\n\nThe West will not go to war over some rocks near China. However they would increase pressure for a peaceful resolution via Sanctions and weapons deliveries to Taiwan similar to the Russian-Ukraine War. Eventually leading down towards artillery bombardment and sea blockades to starve each island out similar to the first two Taiwan Strait Crisis-es. However I suspect they could leverage their dealings with Russia and their Belt and Road \u201cPals\u201d to compensate for the sanctions. Regardless this will lead to a globalization breakdown filled with panic and massive sell offs.\n\nThe real question comes as China begins to eat up islands belonging to Taiwan. I suspect a positive feedback loop of further investment away from China and China slowly eating up the Islands closest to them and using conquered islands as launching bases. This can increase Nationalistic Fervor within China regardless of how poor the citizens will become. \n\n# Miscellaneous Notes I cannot find a spot for them\n\n* Citizens discontent in passive aggression. Bai-lan/\u6446\u70c2 \u201cLet it rot\u201d or Tangping/\u8eba\u5e73 \u201c Lying Flat\u201d has been a growing trend of Youth to now Middle class refusing to work/cooperate because they believe it is hopeless for them to become successful ([link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/the-rise-of-bai-lan-why-chinas-frustrated-youth-are-ready-to-let-it-rot)). \n*  The QUAD Alliance of Japan, India,Australia, and the USA is the NATO of Asia for military cooperation and encouraging trade deals. Already increases in trade deals are occurring through India and Australia due to China-Australia Trade War tensions for political reasons ([link](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-india-trade-deal-open-biggest-economic-door-morrison-2022-04-02/)). It is also worth noting that Western Countries are starting to realize they prefer to keep their intellectual property rather than constantly looking for cheaper workers. \n* China has been trying to become self-sufficient in recent times. Made-in-China Policy is designed to achieve independence from foreign supplies by 2025 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025)).  Concerning especially when you remember the US Audit Investigations threaten black listings of Chinese companies beginning in 2024/2025. \n* There is already a noticeable counter-influence towards the Chinese debt traps. The partnership for infrastructure  and Investment (PGII) is a $600B investment scheme for developing nations([Link](https://www.axios.com/2022/06/30/g7s-600b-infrastructure-bid-to-counter-china)). This could scare China into being more aggressive as NATO and other Western Democracies create their own debt lending programs for undeveloped and developing nations. \n* The Data leak is definitely a complete embarrassment to the Party and the Security Forces. I wonder if the data will be an insight to the rotten panda in the zoo. I question the income and expense costs reported in China. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Shut up and give me Plays!\n\nOverall I am expecting the \u201cWe got a Cold War at Home\u201d version of a Cold War. I believe the Global market is going to lose **1.4 Billion or more people** (China, Russia, Belarus, possibly more) within the following years. \n\n* Shares in $YANG (3x Bear Market) --&gt; This shit decays so buy shares around $10.\n   * I had some shares of Yang before I sold it at $12, I plan to buy more as it decays back down.\n* $SQQQ Shares --&gt; US Hedgies and boomers are still praying for a happy Commie China if they could \u201cjust get rid of Xi somehow\u201d.\n   * Aim for a price of less than $45-50 a share. \n* Shares into India and Mexico ETF --&gt; These are the next closest cheap manufacturing AND closely linked to Western allies. I cannot discuss tickers cuz many are below $500M. Look it up yourselves Retards.\n   * Here are some that I currently have: 10x of $EWW Shares ( iShares MSCI Mexico w/ $800M Cap ) , 20x of $EPI Shares (WisdomTree India Earnings ETF w/ $650M Cap).\n      * I plan to continue buying more as the weeks continue. I just prefer to lower my cost basis. I can't gamble like some people on here.  \n* $AAPL Puts \u2192 No particular reason, just betting on a decreased nation\u2019s incomes for one of Apple\u2019s largest demand of their products. \n   * (Spread Price: Near the money strike with a 10% put debit spread, Date: Mid August) \n      * I suspect you can also bet on other companies that are heavily tied into China but I am not going to list every single one for you. Plus $AAPL has EA on July 28th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If I turn up dead and or missing, someone tell the mortician or the cops that my disappearance was not suicidal or due to my chronic gambling addiction. I have no debts from any loan sharks nor do I plan to.**",

The Dow, S&amp;P, and Nasdaq we're all down ~2%.(2.61%, 2.04%,1.40% respectively)\n\nIronically this was the biggest single day drop across all the indices so far that year, despite 12 weeks of higher highs. The main reasoning behind this move was Delta variant (lol) and consumer sentiment this is a direct quote from an article from last year:  \"Retail sales grew surprisingly in June, but a measure of consumer sentiment for July showed that Americans are growing less confident about the economy.\" Sound familiar?\n\nMoving on we closed at max pain for Wednesdays options.(~$382)  Lot of regards trading options this week ig \n\nNow let's look at:\n\nApple (6.6% of SPY)\nDown over 2% on the day with news of cost cutting and layoffs in the future kinda suss a week before earnings.

    "selftext": "So what kind of coked out adderall overdose made me go bold with this prediction of imminent doom when the market has been doing uppies all week? It's pretty simple. Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting. Then on Thursday we have the Q2 GDP numbers come out confirming we're officially in a recession. (a fact I called last October btw, it just took a couple months for the data to catch up) The real action though is in the Thursday after hours Earnings Reports. Specifically, the ERs for two of the biggest companies on the planet, both of which I expect to fail spectacularly.\n\nApple and Amazon.\n\nJust in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.\n\nI think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?\n\nFor Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Amazon C-Suite](https://preview.redd.it/pnhvt5avduc91.jpg?width=202&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05b98c07a8fc2cc1a5eba7ba2a12275fe2c681f)\n\nFor Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China. If you haven't noticed, China ~~is currently approaching~~ [has reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlpC5OC0q_A) the \"tanks in the streets\" level of civil unrest and banking collapse due to the ponzi scheme real estate and infrastructure plan they've been running finally collapsing. (if you need a primer on why and how that's collapsing, see the DD \"One Company, Two Debts\" pinned to my profile from 10 months ago - I been like Burry level ahead of all this shit)\n\nSo, to recap, on 7/27, you're going to have a FED rate hike, then on 7/28 you're going to see headlines screaming about how we're officially in recession all day, then that night you'll see two of the biggest pillars of the market report dumpster fire earnings. Given all that, what do you think boomers and algos and momos are going to do Friday morning?\n\nSo I just scrapped my 21 year old pickup after the motor blew. I'm gonna spend $200 on this lotto play. I've put in $100 so far, I'll throw in the other Benji sometime between Friday and Tuesday.\n\n**3 D0G 8/19 41c**\n\n**1 AMZN 7/29 101p**\n\n**1 AAPL 7/29 133p**\n\n**2 SPY 8/19 315p**\n\nNormally this would be flared as a yoyololo, but I'm not putting nearly as much $$ on this as required by sub rules, so I guess meme since I'm not including enough info for a real DD post? But if you need evidence of conviction, my house has a 30-year fixed 2% mortgage, and I'm currently selling it to go live in my buddies basement to try and front-run the real estate collapse - I'm probably too late, but we'll see!\n\n**TLDR: Black Friday next week (maybe, but maybe not, I'm only putting $200 on this)**\n\nAs far as an update on my food shortage play, I'm now up to 20 1/23 calls on W3AT and 5 11/18 calls on S0YB, I just keep buying that sweet dip. Once I get enough S0YB calls I'll be adding some C0RN as well.\n\nFinally, more than 95% of my total port is now long GME.",

It traded well above the today\u2019s low anchored VWAP - 404.52. This will be a level to keep an eye on tomorrow if we see downside.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iz1odozslde91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c512cb7315239f793db51f9b4432d12197d50cb4\n\nThe expanded uptrend seems to be playing out as we near 409-417 zone. This is where we could find some resistance. Best case for bulls is that we chop in this zone before more upside.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ps251tulde91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e73ff4dc61a1ffb263c5bd40e4bf653c6b3a2b4\n\n# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;The stock rally gained traction, defying skeptics in the aftermath of the Fed decision, with traders reducing bets on rate hikes as the drumbeat of recession grew louder amid poor economic data.  \nEquities reached a seven-week high, led by defensive groups, which are frequently sought after during difficult times.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prior to the results of Apple and Amazon,\u00a0 technology underperformed. Bond yields fell, and swaps referencing policy meeting dates showed bets that the fed funds rate will peak around 3.25% before the end of 2022, less than 100 basis points higher than it is now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nInvestors remained bullish on the Fed slowing its rate of tightening as data indicated the economy was losing steam heading into the second half of the year. That came a day after Jerome Powell said hikes would slow at some point, sparking a strong market reaction that was slammed by Fed watchers who said traders got it all wrong because tighter financial conditions are needed to combat inflation.\n\n# Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;There was no mention of potential Biden administration tariff reduction in the White House readout.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;US Treasury Secretary Yellen: 2Q GDP contraction demonstrates the economy's move to more sustainable growth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Biden after GDP data: Fed's Powell and several high-level banking executives claim that we are not in a recession.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The OPEC+ meeting on August 3rd is expected to maintain or slightly increase oil output in September, according to eight OPEC+ sources.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fed Swaps now pricing less than 90 basis-points of added Fed hikes this year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;US GDP QoQ Advance Actual -0.9% (Forecast 0.5%, Previous -1.6%) DXY weakened, S&amp;P 500 weakened.\n\n# Economic Calendar - July 29, 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs1qre93mde91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b62ab2cfb2fdd52fc46ee9daa00873b52df2fb5\n\n# \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA - Friday July 29, 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lem3yq6mde91.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=617764bd2256b3c0b3c380cfab5afcee684e1fa4\n\n## Where are we on the Chart?\n\nAs stated earlier, SPY is nearing 409 - 413.48 - 417.36 zone where we could see some chop as we are near the resistance of long-term downtrend. 413 would be an upside target for tomorrow.

    "title": "Why I'm getting SQ calls for tonight's earnings.",
    "selftext": "Block, Inc., formerly Square, Inc., is an American financial services and digital payments company based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.\n\nConsider the fact that the company's stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.\n\n**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**\n\nhttps://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq\n\nSquare on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. \n\nIn its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.\n\nCash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.\n\n**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**\n\nAt the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.\n\nSquare is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square's gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.\n\nSquare and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.\n\n**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**\n\nIn a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.\n\n\"Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term,\" he wrote.\n\nAnnounced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging \"[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)\" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block's 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the \"risk profile\" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.\n\nSquare stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**\n\nFor merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there's still a risk of defaults.\n\nPrior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App's direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.\n\nSquare is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.\n\nThe Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company's subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.\n\nTo broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma's tax business for $50 million in cash. It's a free service for consumers.\n\n**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**\n\nWith roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved \"upmarket,\" targeting larger businesses.\n\nSQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).\n\nIn addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.\n\nSquare recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.\n\n**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**\n\nThe company's Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.\n\nMeanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.\n\nSquare on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.\n\nIn trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.\n\nOne key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume \u2014 total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers \u2014 also known as GPV. It's a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.\n\n**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**\n\nSquare earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.\n\nSquare said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.\n\nFinancial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.\n\nGross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, management said: \"Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square.\"\n\nExcluding Afterpay, the company said \"gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year.\"\n\n**Block Stock Technical Analysis**\n\nAfter its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.\n\nThat soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google in stature.\n\nFollowing its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019. Then shares surged in 2020 as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App.",

    "selftext": " Hey guys, if you have not seen my Yolo post, here is a shot of the position at the time \u2026.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6bx6d3rm2fg91.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3d24bf0a0bd8446e2a29b44a9c7bc945165041)\n\n...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  \n\n\nMy Thesis on this Play is as follows -  \nI have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..\n\n  \nAfter the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.\n\n  \n\u2026Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it\u2019s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- \u201cBuy Buy Baby\u201d. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.\n\n  \nWith GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC\u2019s cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478d80696050b72babda6908d275b968acd075ca)\n\n  \nAs GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  \nThat said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.\n\n  \nAgain, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I\u2019m glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.\n\n  \nSo again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of \u201cmeme basket\u201d and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.\n\n  \nSo back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME\u2019s stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.\n\n  \nI waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time\u2026 either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.\n\n  \nAs things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  \nThen last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279)\n\n  \nAfter watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post\u2026 I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)\u2026.  \nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.\n\n  \nThe stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  \nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  \nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.\n\n  \nThursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.\n\n  \nFriday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  \nSo yeah\u2026 I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  \nAgain, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of \u201cMOASS\u201d like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.\n\n  \nAs one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  \n It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.\n\n  \nIn closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).\n\n  \nFor anyone interested in the statistics on short interest end all around holdings I would urge you to check out - w w w. byebyeshorts . c o m\n\n  \nIn regards to the Yolo\u2026\n\n  \nI Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, &amp; the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.  \nI decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why\u2026.  \nMuch love everyone!

Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me \"the chicken comes home to roost.\" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a fa\u00e7ade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, \"but that's another topic\" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wish you all the best, but only a few end up with the bread in the end.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: DCA'ing debit put spreads biweekly in AMZN, TSLA, GOOG, SPY, TQQQ, 60-180 days exp.",

Also, since the U.S. FED have increased the interest rate, the increased margin interest rate they charge you on the margin loans is also good for them. They also are going to offer expanded cryptos trading, source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220809005087/en/Interactive-Brokers-Expands-Cryptocurrency-Trading](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220809005087/en/Interactive-Brokers-Expands-Cryptocurrency-Trading)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrokerages are like a bank, they offer low interests on your cash deposits sitting in your accounts (or none in my case, my broker is shit) and charge you more on the margin loans (they take the spread, risk free). There are some rich people with more money than they know what to do with, and also not everyone invests everything they have in stocks/bonds etc. so they hold cash thinking stocks have more room to fall or cash is just an optionality in itself, cash is liquid.  This is the official data from the U.S. regarding employment: [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email)\n\nTLDR: the U.S. is doing well with employment situation so \"the recession\" is not going to happen short-term at the very least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother good thing about $IBKR options is that, it's IV is very low around 30% and for comparison $AAPL has around 25% implied volatility for just out of the money call options. I don't have access to bloomberg to analyze the company further, nor do I have access to options flow, darkpool etc. Someone with access to that kind of information, please feel free to chime in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have **4 $65 calls expiring on August 19th** (just being a degen and it's riskier) and also **5 $65 calls expiring on September 16th** (safer). The last time they had earnings it was reported on July 19th so the next earnings report should be somewhere in Oct. So September 16th or probably later expiry dates should cover the stock runup before the earings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It's not a financial advice obviously.**",

    "selftext": "Listen, I didn't mean to offend you, she's a nice lady but don't let that distract from what I have to say:\n\nEveryone wants to know what is going on with the market and \"did we hit the bottom\".  If it pleases the court of angry apes I will attempt to demystify:\n\nPandemic:  The Fed adds between 5-8 trillion dollars in currency, while the whole world is closed created a falsely unaffected market while the supply chain tightens and shatters and reorders all behind the scenes.  One of the most primary markets remains open, real estate and home buying, during the whole pandemic and sky rockets (or can the apes all say INFLATES).  We get a vax and come out of quarantines and suddenly inflation hits everything.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/11/us/how-covid-stimulus-money-was-spent.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis scares everyone.  Shit dicks and Nozzles de bagga de douche (it's french) talk about runaway inflation as if the dollar is backed by Madagascarian oil (ridiculous, the dollar is the standard, we'll need bazookas not bucks if the dollar goes under cause we in WWIII) and that covers the big money thinking it's time to reorganize the old folio and reinvest their tendies in all the old money places.  This was always going to happen.  \n\nThe market ran faster than Harambe towards the light and you know eventually everyone wants to take a taste of the money life.  So hedgies and everyone else took a haircut roughly six months after the last stimmies were sent out.  Bonds had gone back up so why not put a little something away for the rapture.  I aint pretty so I gotta date seniors and Granny gonna need a new set of titties.  They expensive but tendie titties are the only reason my hands stay diamond.  I tell my ladies \"you gotta pick up what gravity put down\".\n\nNow it turns out that inflation is subsiding and being reabsorbed as the Fed has the opportunity to return some of it's balance sheet and oil is becoming more reasonable.  Everyone is realizing that this isn't 2010 crash,  THERE ISN'T A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET EVENT LIKE A BUBBLE THATS BURST.   Everyone that bought a home during the pandemic has a historically low rate NOT AN ADJUSTABLE RATE THAT CAUSED THE LAST IMPLOSION.\n\n# BUT HERE'S THE KEY:  DURING THE PANDEMIC A SHIT TON OF COMPANIES OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT.  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GREAT JOB NUMBERS AND STILL HAVE JOB AVAILABILITIES FOR AIRLINES AND NUMEROUS OTHER FIELDS, ETC. \n\nThis means that we have a larger retirement class and a burgeoning, suddenly higher earning (because businesses have raised wages to entice and compete) young middle class.  SP, DOW, NAS all turned back near the 2020 plateaus we were at and here's the kicker.  When you pour 5-8 Trilly into a market only so much can spill out and hold outside.  YOU HAVE TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE.  The vig has been working and those divies are begging the oldheads to get planted.  Look at AAPL, it's up almost to ATH and if Eve weren't such a needy bitch it would be passed it (why do chicks only want to eat what isn't theirs?).  The shorts are ready to call it quits and BBBY is proof of that, clearly there is some reversal energy and just like when I see a little 100 pound gymnast walking a bull mastiff the blockchains and NAS makes me scream out the window \"WHO'S WALKING WHO?\".  I don't know but theyr'e both looking to retrace.\n\nI give this an 80% chance of bull market given the present conditions so where to go?\n\nPersonally, I got 1000 shares and 3 modest contracts (I am humiliated at this number and I beg you to roast it as I deserve) of BBBY.  \n\nVUZI (3000 shares and 200 contracts) is the next runner 28% Short of the float with almost 12 days to cover and they already are working with Amazon, just a matter of time till the big order comes then fuck the moon I'M GOING TO MARS.  TELLME I'M WRONG INTARDOES, Augmented Reality is the future and vuzix is the only brand that cares about glasses not looking like Babylon 5 fucked 1970's headgear.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBNGO is running as the future of medical diagnostics (3000 shares, 40 contracts.  \n\nAMD will keep taking market share and we'll never stop needing more chips. \n\nMy fiancee's boyfriend says I'm smart and he let me use his computer to write this so I know I am.",

    "selftext": "**Recap On Mondays Market Action:**\n\n* SPY closed up 0.41%\n* QQQ closed up 0.81%\n* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 0.45%\n* VIX closed up 2.15%\n\nGood evening everyone, today we saw the positive market action from the last few weeks continue on. The major indices opened slightly down from Fridays close but soon rallied and closed higher. Many big name stocks are also continuing to advance and setup for potential new entries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eetudt7eazh91.png?width=2276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0f1c674268d999aa774daddb8eac87f1a340c6\n\nSPY broke through its base and has advanced on somewhat decreasing volume. Ideally we would like to see a large volume spike as SPY pushed through that base. The declining volume is something to take note of but is not something to be overly concerned about. We are fast approaching the 200 Exponential Moving Average and a base that was formed in April. This may be a spot of resistance in coming days.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aww8lrqeazh91.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8950372dd41965339fffb204a134c6a0307760\n\nQQQ pushed through its base today and provided an opportunity to open a position. Similarly to SPY, more volume would have been nice but we are still seeing decent price action. QQQ is a bit further from the 200 EMA and its April base, so there may be more room to advance.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nSince the markets have been acting decisively more positive I have taken on several new positions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33md33hfazh91.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=558b4e030a305cb0f1cc7966ba2e0430c49fb36c\n\nQLD is 2x bullish ETF that tracks the NASDAQ 100. For every 1% move the NASDAQ 100 has, QLD will move 2%, positive or negative. I opened this position Friday as QQQ broke through its base. Even with the overall markets behaving better I was still cautious and bought a small starting position of 20% of what I want my final position to be. For example, if my total position of QLD will be 100 shares, I opened this position with 20 and will add more if QLD continues to advance. By doing this you are able to keep your loses smaller since you have a smaller position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/of0eaq3gazh91.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31582ff01000eab0fb98ae3caa8eeb082c0a3513\n\nGOOGL also provided and entry on Friday and I opened a small positions of 20% of what I wanted my total position to be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtfhmungazh91.png?width=2280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef5eb6337c9015c7dea9934aab6c149ab40a0051\n\nAAPL pushed through tops from April and also provided an entry on Friday. Can you guess how much I bought \u2026 20% of what my final position would be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucajtu4hazh91.png?width=2257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90b87b4e5034e4081252a8460a73a0ad5df49175\n\nON pushed through tops from December and I opened a positions of 20% of what I want my total shares to be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36gtrunhazh91.png?width=2275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b66571adaa9bae40ef7dfd08b86d313535e9549\n\nELF is approaching a short base and may push past the trigger prices of $38.20. ELF is on the list because Sales are up 26% and Earnings Per Share are up 71% year over year. ELF also has 3.9 days of short interest. If we see a push through $38.20 with good volume and a good market this could be a buy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10ifg49iazh91.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba5a3a899303179c90471df17b41c8bdd72bacc1\n\nCLR is approaching a slightly longer base with a trigger of $69.50. Similarly we would need to see a good volume increase through the trigger price and a good market overall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83w78myiazh91.png?width=2267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04ff3e90305974fd518af490c78ffbe356c80c1f\n\nLastly, NVDA is approaching a long base from early June and has a trigger price of $192.80. NVDA is a large cap stock and can really move once it gets going.\n\nWith all of these potential setups it is important to remember that overall market sentiment can impact how individual stocks behave. If the market is in a bad place it is best not to buy. Also do not go heavy on your exposure, I would only purchase 20% of what you want you final amount of shares to be.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nThe stock market is in a healthy rally and many individual stocks are setting up for potential buys. It is important to keep watching for new stocks that may be breaking out. If a stock is breaking out do not heavily increase your exposure at once. Carefully plan out you buy points incase the market or stock reverses suddenly. Also FOMC minutes are being released Wednesday and that may add some extra volatility to the markets. Overall, we can begin to add exposure but should still have a slightly cautious mindset in case the market turns around quickly.",

    "selftext": "Since the middle of June 2022, the Apple Plunge Protection Liquidity Engineers (APPLE) have been using their 3 Trillion dollar hedge fund money to aggressively and assertively guarantee that AAPL stock goes up in a straight line.  Seriously, go look at the chart, it's absolutely uncanny.  \n\nThis is with no new actual news from Apple, nothing about better phones, better laptops, nothing about new Apple Watches or new services.   Just Tim Apple telling his people \"Do so many Stock Buybacks that the stock price makes an UNMISTAKABLE LINE STRAIGHT UP.\"\n\nThis should be the only thing anyone is talking about.  Stock that was 130 two months ago is 175 today, guaranteed to be 180 tomorrow and 200 not long afterwards. \n\nYet every single chumchugger on this web sight is talking about nothing but Bed Bath and Beyond.   \n\nAAPL and the APPLE team are very angry about this development.   Financial engineering so blatantly obvious so as to guarantee profits for anyone who buys AAPL shares.  And this is the thanks they get? \n\nHarumph.",

    "title": "$PSNY: why isn\u2019t this moving?",
    "selftext": "So now that we graduated to the pump phase of WSB rather than the endless fud I noticed that PSNY has been stuck this entire run. $SPY and the market are moving but the only action from $PSNY was a 6% freak out candle last Thursday eod. \n\nThe IV is low in the 50\u2019s which is normal but less than $TSLA\u2019s IV which makes it weird. Lower than the Iv of all the other EV companies actually. The borrow rate is odd it\u2019s at 337% and rising, also since 8/11 on interactive brokers shares have been drying out. IV on the puts is actually two times the IV on the calls so something wrong there. I watched $Psny before it merged and Iv was usually 250%+.Like the stock had a 45% jump in two days about 2months ago yet IV is now in the 50\u2019s??? \n\nSo it\u2019s not like the stock can\u2019t run hard af. If $PSNY runs 50% again the calls could be like 50bags. Just looked at the chain, it actually loaded especially the Jan\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a shit company, they make electric vehicles you can rent them at enterprise and hertz. They delivered 21,200 cars in the first six months of the year compared to 9510 last year, outpacing their higher priced rivals LCID/RIVN. Since the start of 2022 worldwide purchases have increased 350%.  They recently reaffirmed guidance yet nothing \u2026just stuffed. I actually see polestars relatively frequently on the road (upper northwest city) Yes, the economy is going to shit but that didn\u2019t stop $AAPL from going to almost ATH.\n\nSo wtf is going on? Solid company, history of running hard, as early as 2months ago ran 45%, has memes aka the Island Boy Song about Polestar https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yDseMkrduYI , yet  isn\u2019t running during this crazy rally\n\n\nI think the problem is that shorts entered right at market bottom in June so if it goes above $10 by a few dollars exit is likely, since that seems like their average entry price, so been working overtime to keep a lid; my guess. With low Iv if this runs like the others the returns would be solid if not wild. If the lowest it traded was $8.5 in the absolutely worst market possible, fail to see how this isn\u2019t a floor.",

The stock market continue its pullback that started last week when the indices ran into their May highs. This is still \u201ctechnically\u201d a market rally but the recent selling has definitely put pressure on this rally. This selloff may be in anticipation of Fed Chief Jerome Powell\u2019s speech which he will give Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This speech will give investors a better idea of what the Feds economic outlook and may contain clues about future rate hikes. We may see lots of sideways action, especially after todays selloff, until Jerome Powell speaks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tn2xz9tmmcj91.png?width=2251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d8109be3058348fe9cf554672b76796ef8ea5a8\n\nSPY gapped down and fell throughout the day without making really any attempt to recover in price. We broke back below Mays previous highs which served a resistance area in early August. With this break and a close below the 21 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/), investors should be cautious about opening large long positions. This combined with the increase in volume we saw today means we need to be careful with new or open positions. Hopefully we will see some consolidation around these levels and a push early next week to new highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uebiombnmcj91.png?width=2272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9830b0ba207c27e31cdc2e15a455b23a30c5260a\n\nQQQ has a more positive outlook but not by much, the highs from June remain intact as a support zone but we did see a close well below the 21 day EMA. We had slightly less selling volume today but have still not seen any days recently with strong buying volume. QQQ is definitely acting stronger than SPY at the moment but both indices are telling us to be cautious.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nI am currently sitting completely in cash. My lost position was in Apple (AAPL) but I was forced out Friday at my buy price.\n\n**Potential Setups:**\n\nIf you read the [ETF and Market Evaluation for 08/21/2022](https://everydaytrades.com/etf-and-market-evaluation-for-08-21-2022/) posted yesterday you will notice many stocks that are doing okay in this environment are in familiar sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d33xlqxnmcj91.png?width=2267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b86e3af541fbc8bf4113841945ee15e6f7996d0a\n\nViper Energy Partners (VNOM) had a huge day today moving up 5.85% on a large volume increase. It stopped just short of its most recent high and has a potential buy point of $31.90. If this triggers and you choose to buy be careful if the market is not acting well. The major indices can play a large role in how an individual stock moves.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzcm17eomcj91.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e04b2aaea9ad8c221ae9176cdfdc6ecb0ddb5e67\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has a small base with a buy of $306.00. This base is somewhat far from where VRTX closed so if we see this trigger it will need to be associated with heavy volume and a good market.\n\nThere are very few other stocks setting up with high probability trades. Todays decline hurt many stocks regardless of sector. It is interesting however that the sectors showing strength now, primary oil and energy, are the same sectors that where acting strong back in January and February.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nFollowing todays sharp selloff and Jerome Powell speaking on Friday there are few stocks setting up with nice bases. Buying a stock on a pullback hoping for a bounce off of the 8 day or 21 day EMA is extremely risky at this point. This continues to be a news driven environment and risky positions can quickly turn against you. There are a few sectors that are showing strength but many stocks within them have been damaged by todays selloff. Overall if you open a position you need to be quick to cut losses or take profits earlier than usual.",

    "selftext": "man, reddit fucked up my title. oh well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGreetings apes, while this sub\u2019s attention skyrockets, I figured it would be nice to spread some love for my favorite little EV stock: Fisker (FSR). Before we really get started, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d read [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvvalp/fisker_inc_fsr_dd/) DD from a year ago. It explains a bunch of the positive catalysts that give Fisker extreme potential to become a big player in the EV game soon enough. Just letting you know, literally NONE of them have fallen through since. Fisker is on track to meet all of its old goals, especially one critical one coming up in November.\n\nNow looking back 1 year ago, Fisker was at $14. A few months later, it ripped to $24 with some positive news. Shortly thereafter, the market collapsed and the big fish forgot about speculative investments. They crawled back into their holes and continued to get paid to invest other people\u2019s money in bonds and AAPL.\n\nWhy does this matter you ask? Well, let me give those of you who didn\u2019t read the previous DD a quick rundown:\n\nWell, since they last ripped 100%, they\u2019ve managed 50k 250$ reservations and sold out on 5000 down payment pre-orders. That\u2019s quite a few sales and should help their balance sheet pretty significantly. Given the amount of reservations and selling all of their down-payment pre-orders, they\u2019ve got what they asked for and  what they need to succeed.\n\nNow looking at their short interest, they\u2019ve got a short interest of 35% and a darkpool short interest of 58%. So far they\u2019ve stated they\u2019re on track to meet all production deadlines, and there doesn't appear to be undisclosed turbulence. If they produce in November and this stock jumps a little, it\u2019s going to jump A LOT with all that short interest. With that will come a ton of capital for the company, significantly boosting their balance sheets and  allowing them to THRIVE in the future.\n\nI see this as both a solid investment for both the short and long term.\n\nPositions: x2 FSR $10 CALL1/20/23 (I am poor af)",

    "selftext": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-video-cuts-earnings-and-revenue-outlook-for-the-year-stock-falls-11661199597?mod=mw_latestnews\n\nZoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.\n\nZoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar \u2014 a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports \u2014 but also a decline in \u201cthe online business,\u201d or the more casual Zoom user.\n\n\u201cOur revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,\u201d Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.\n\nIn an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren\u2019t flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge is new customer additions,\u201d she said.\n\nZoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a \u201csignificantly positive impact\u201d so far, but admitted in the conference call it was \u201cnot enough to overcome the macro dynamics.\u201d\n\nThe news wasn\u2019t all bad \u2014 Zoom\u2019s enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.\n\n\u201cIt was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,\u201d Steckelberg told MarketWatch.\n\nThe ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% \u2014 all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week \u2014 could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.\n\nThe company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.\n\nM Science\u2019s software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren\u2019t jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.\n\nRead more: Zoom faces a threat from Microsoft Teams, but how great is the risk?\n\nZoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.\n\nZoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nZoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom\u2019s stock is down 47% so far in 2022. The broader S&amp;P 500 index  SPX, -2.14%  has slid 13% this year.",

    "selftext": "**Reason #3:**  \nYou are pumped up on **GREED**. That is something everybody struggles I get that, but many of you don\u2019t even see that you have it or struggle with it. If a got a penny for every post I came through that said something about \u201cI was up over 500% and now down 98% within x amount of hours, I don\u2019t know how that happened.\u201d Because **YOU GOT GREEDY**, you ape. How do you think the stock market works? Stock price only goes up, up, up, and only up? If that was your thought process, quit the game for some time and go back to the drawing board, and learn the basics. I swear you crayon eaters will see over 10,000% gain and still won\u2019t sell. Do you realize what that means? No? That means you are meant to lose around 99% of your plays, you\u2019re not meant to win with this mentality. Ever heard of the saying \u201cslow one wins the race\u201d? This saying is 100% true, when people try to get rich quickly they usually get too blind by quick gains and lose their heads.  \nThis brings me to **lesson #3**: learn the value of money, it is hard to get. There is a quick way to obtain some like behind wendy\u2019s dumpster, but overall it is hard and takes a lot of effort and time. Be very careful. Just because you can turn $1,000 into $25,000 overnight with stocks doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, it is very hard and rare, so be very careful with your plays.  \n \n\n**Reason #4:**   \nYou listen to some schmuck online and take that ape for a profit. Nobody has a magic ball that can foresee the future, it is all chance. This game is so much better than straight-up gambling at the casino because you have significantly more chances of succeeding but still at the end of the day it is still a gamble and just a chance, calculate one but still a chance. I see so many posts saying that ticker **X** will reach **Y or Z** number by the end of this or that date, and you losers buy into it. Nobody knows what the future holds and if somebody says ticker **X** will reach a certain number by the end of someday, **RUN!** They don\u2019t know what they are talking about, they talk straight out of their ass. Anything is possible in the stock market, the share price can go from $1 to $50 in a day, or can fall over 25% nobody knows what will happen, people just put their bets, which is gambling and that is a very different mindset. If you want to have steady gains and not be hit off guard, do your own research and learn more about the stock market.  \nThat brings me to **lesson #4:** Never believe what anybody says regarding the price and date of a stock, take into consideration that the future is unpredictable. Do your own math and homework.  \n   \n \n\nPositions: 1ct AAPL 165 PUT Sep 02 2022 (+53%) 2cts ASO 44 PUTs Sep 30 2022 (+1.27%) \n\n2cts RIOT 7 CALLs Jun 16 2023 (-15.56%)",

    "selftext": "  What\u2019s up retarded apes, I\u2019ve been mostly a lurker here and just watch it all burn from the bench. I haven\u2019t been too long in the game, but I learned a thing or two that I want to share with you banana eater what I learned from my mistakes and just speculations. I hope this will reach at least some people and save you some money. This post is long, so I broke it down into a couple of parts since your attention span is shorter than clownfish's. There will not be TL: DR at the end, so scroll at your discretion. **So why do so many of you lose money consistently?**  \n **Reason #1**: You have 0 ideas about what you are doing.  \n This shouldn\u2019t even be said but this is WSB so here you go. A lot of you apes have no idea what you are doing, making risky plays, and then go to WSB for advice which is like asking an alcoholic how to stop drinking\u2026You play with options like it has 0 consequences and just cannot go tits up. You guys are buying 0DTE FDs without any research, any considerations, and without reading the news. Your only thought process is something along these lines \u201cI see green/red candle so I think it will remain that way\u201d and then you go and burn your cash. Please go and learn what options are, the greeks like delta or theta, IV, etc. There are plenty of good youtube videos that explain everything in detail. Once you start applying basics and consider them like High IV, that will stop you from purchasing options and losing money even if you\u2019re right. For example, you might see a stock price skyrocketing for days and see that options\u2019 IV is over 300% and many of you will look at it and not think anything of it, but if you\u2019re smart you\u2019d walk away, accept that you missed the boat and look for another trade. This brings me to a very important **lesson #1**: **learn to walk away, do not fall into a FOMO circle jerk.**   \n **Reason #2:** You have no idea what the point of a stock market is and how to profit from the game.  \n To dumb it down Barnie style, the whole premise of a stock market is to buy shares or options for a specific price and then sell it to somebody else for more, sometimes much more. Which means **nobody here is your friend**. Sure, we can give advice, dd, or words of encouragement here and there but the second we get the chance to profit off you, we will. That is just the game, nothing personal and I have no guilt about selling you shares or options that ran up over 200% for the past 2 days because I don\u2019t want to be the one left with a bag. So, **lesson #2**: take everybody\u2019s words with a grain of salt and don\u2019t look at them like they are your buddy who will throw in their retirement money to \u201cstick it to the hedges.\u201d Whenever I see people \u201cteaming up\u201d on this subreddit just makes me lose brain cells that I can\u2019t afford to lose.   \n   \n \n\nPositions: 1ct AAPL 165 PUT Sep 02 2022 (+53%) 2cts ASO 44 PUTs Sep 30 2022 (+1.27%) \n\n2cts RIOT 7 CALLs Jun 16 2023 (-15.56%)",

    "selftext": "  **Reason #5:** You don\u2019t know math or don\u2019t take advantage of it.  \nThis one is not on the radar for most of you. What is the probability of a person who buys options at any time of expiration to be profitable? Well, it depends on the IV. Now let\u2019s assume that IV is around 100% which is normal, the MMs don\u2019t expect crazy volatility so if you\u2019re right with the direction you\u2019ll be in profit. The chances of you being right are 33.33% How do I know that? Because the market only moves in 3 directions, **Up, Down, and sideways/flat.** That is why the only 3 ways you\u2019ll profit are through buying calls, puts, or through theta. So 33.33%. The only difference between 0DTE and long expiration dates is you have more time to **POTENTIALLY** recover if the stock price went into the other 2 directions. But nonetheless, just because you have 3 months till expiration calls **DOESN\u2019T** mean that your contracts will recover. For all we know, the stock price will tank and go flat line for a very long time and the price will recover only 6 months later if ever. Let\u2019s take it up a notch and go beyond 1-day movement. So if on the first day of buying a contract or a share you have 33.33% of being right, the chances of the same direction price movement are less and less each day goes by since there are other 2 directions the price can move. \n\n  \nSo **lesson #5**: Use math to your advantage. As a rule of thumb for me, if I want to buy a call and already see that the stock price went up by $3+ I take it as a loss, or missed boat, and move on to a different play.   \n **Reason #6**: You think the whole world is against you and believe in every conspiracy theory.  \nThe stock market is a dog-eat-dog world, even though anyone would love to sell you a piece of trash stock for an overvalued price, everyone is on the same boat just on the other side. There are bulls and bears who are actively making the same bet as you, you\u2019re not the only one who is rooting for a stock. You buy a stock, and so do many others. And let me break down the stigma behind the Technical Analysis aka TA. People love bashing it, saying it is all nonsense, horoscope signs, leaf reading, etc. Truth be told, they are wrong...well not entirely right. There is a reason why we can spot clear and obvious resistance or support levels because that is where many people either buy in or sell out. It is not to say that T.A is always accurate, but it is worth looking into because it just might increase your chances of being profitable. The patterns can fall through or \u201cpredict\u201d the next movement, which leaves you with around a 50% chance, it is just up to you to figure out when to pull out. Also a warning, there could be fake breakouts or falls so keep that in your consideration.\n\n **Lesson #6:** T.A can be helpful but go in with an exit strategy in case you\u2019re wrong and expect the pattern to fail. It is much better to lose 10%-20% of your contract, take a step back and change your strategy than just hoping that stock will either recover or dip\u2026 It can, but the chances to have the exact movement that you need to recoup your losses are very small.\n\nPositions:  2cts RIOT 7 CALLs Jun 16 2023 (-12.56%)\n\n**Sold** 1ct AAPL 165 PUT Sep 02, 2022, for 105% profit because I was happy with gains and did not want to risk it.  \n**Sold** 2cts ASO 44 PUTs Sep 30, 2022 (for a $6 loss because I'm looking for a better entry)",

    "title": "The Biggest Short: Why $AAPL Is An Overvalued Company in Decline",
    "selftext": "Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.\n\nWhile everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple\u2019s valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.\n\nA lot of people treat Apple like it\u2019s the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:\n\n&gt;P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  \n&gt;  \n&gt;D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long term debt: $93B  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM Earnings: $59.4B\n\nCurrently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:\n\n&gt;P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)\n\nIn their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.\n\nApple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.\n\nThe reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. \n\nApple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple\u2019s revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple\u2019s revenue and earnings will drop even more.\n\nEveryone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn\u2019t as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it\u2019s expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can\u2019t see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nAnother product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they\u2019ve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they\u2019re gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [\u201cmocked\u201d](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.\n\nApple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it\u2019s hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That\u2019s a pretty big risk for a company that\u2019s been bleeding cash.\n\nAnd finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple\u2019s main advantages with their software is the fact that they don\u2019t show ads. When this changes, Apple\u2019s software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple\u2019s ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it\u2019s hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he\u2019s full of bad takes.\n\nAs Apple\u2019s earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. \n\nIf they don\u2019t halt or decrease their buyback, they\u2019ll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.\n\ntl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it. This thing is going to come down eventually, the only question is when.",

Perica works for Apple as vice president\u00a0of corporate development and reports directly to CEO **Tim Cook.**\n\nWhen Bloomberg picked up the news on Wednesday, it said in the report that Apple made a $1 billion investment in Didi in 2016, and shortly after Perica\u00a0joined the board of the Chinese company.\n\n*See also:\u00a0Will iPhone 14 Feature Satellite Connectivity?

After a high-profile public debut in the U.S. market, DiDi was forced to make a retreat and delist its shares from the NYSE as domestic regulators continued to haunt the company.\n\nDiDi\u2019s shares were subsequently delisted and are currently traded over the counter.\n\nApple\u2019s negative returns on the initial investment was not an \u201cattractive financial outcome,\u201d Munster said.

    "selftext": "Reg sho is bullshit.  Most of time FTDs are bullshit and meaningless.  Shorts don't have to cover.\n\nThe 12 million share cap is being thrown about is completely false, complete fucking bullshit. The S3 is the governing document, and it determines the maximum amount BBBY is authorized to sell. I suggest reading it. The answer is 900 million shares.\n\nBBBY can file a supplement at any time without any approval and sell as many shares as it wants to sell.   At this point, its a cut and paste doc that takes 20 minutes to file. 12 million cap is completely false, complete fucking bullshit. Don't trust me. Ask any securities lawyer.\n\nRegarding staving off BK, BBBY now has $500 million more in debt and negative $100 million per month in negative cash flow. 100/500 = 5 months &lt; 1 year. So if you are bullish, it is based on bad math.\n\nThe plan to shrink sales and migrate back to brands that have lower margins is too late.  It will just make things worse, because the problem is simple.  Amazon took the sales.   Don't trust me. Shop for a comforter on both websites and report back.\n\nFTDs, sho rarely results in a squeeze.  Don't believe me?  Here is python tool you can use.\n\nLook for yourself:  [https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure\\_to\\_deliver/?quote=AAPL](https://stocksera.pythonanywhere.com/ticker/failure_to_deliver/?quote=AAPL)\n\nSince BBBY can now  file a supplement to the S3  with zero authorization and sell stock in 12 million share tranches, that makes it pretty fucking hard to pull off a squeeze. BBBY will keep selling stock until the debt trades up to 100 cents on the dollar. Right now $1 of BBBY debt sells for 20 cents, which implies a 99% chance of default (reference Freeman Capital July letter to BBBY board for this stat).   BBBY needs to sell a lot of stock to make that happen which means there is a lot of fucking stock supply headed your way. Like a big fucking fire hose of new stock.\n\nThe BBBY ticker is not in rare supply.   It is plentiful and getting more plentiful.   Bagholders are bailing everywhere. Which is why it tanked today and will do so until it hits $0 in 5 months or less.",

    "title": "When Apple unveils the iPhone 14 on Sept 7, will it also unveil a $billion deal with Globalstar(GSAT)?",
    "selftext": "Is the option market badly under-estimating (and **under-pricing**) the likelihood that APPL announces a deal with GSAT on Sept7, the day the iPhone 14 is unveiled?  I think the facts say yes, largely because the Apple-focused market seems so ignorant of the story of Globalstar and its technology. A few details:\n\nLast year,  based on nothing more than an (easily disprovable) rumor that APPL was planning to announce a GSAT deal as part of the iPhone 13 launch, GSAT shot from $1.43 to $2.69 in early Sept, then back down when the deal didn't happen.   A year later, the same story is beginning to repeat, only from everything I have dug up this time the technology is real and ready, there is lots of varied supporting evidence, and industry experts, including the top satellite analyst Tim Farrar, think the deal is real this year.\n\nSo what will happen to GSAT if a deal is announced?  Well, if last year's poorly sourced rumor could send GSAT up to $2.69, it seems reasonable to say a real deal with the world's most valuable company should send GSAT much higher.  Let's assume, very conservatively,  it jumps to $3.50.  Right now 9/9 $2.50 calls are selling for 11 cents.   If the deal is real and you exercise on Sept 9 for $3.50, you'd turn 11 cents into $1,  9x your money.  Of course, the stock could go much higher than $3.50...\n\nSo what's the evidence this time the deal will happen?  A little history...\n\nApple's has had what Bloomberg called \"a top secret team working on satellite\" since 2019.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/apple-has-top-secret-team-working-on-internet-satellites](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/apple-has-top-secret-team-working-on-internet-satellites)\n\nOn Feb 10, 2021, Globalstar issued a press release GLOBALSTAR\u2019S BAND N53 IN QUALCOMM\u2019S X65 MODEM\"   ....\"By having global 5G band support for n53 in Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 5G solutions, our potential device ecosystem expands significantly to include the most popular smartphones, laptops, tablets, automated equipment and other IoT modules.\"  GSAT Stock Jumped from  $1.28 to $2.48 before giving up all those gains.\n\nSkip ahead to Aug 30, 2021.  TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, speculates the iPhone 13 will use the Globalstar.  The stock goes from $1.43 to $2.69.  The only problem:  The iPhone 13 used the Qualcomm **X60** chip.  That was \\*not\\* the **X65** chip released 6 months earlier with the Globalstar band.  The x65 will be in the iPhone 14, Apple has confirmed.  That means the new iphone released next Wed. will have a built in ability to connect to GSAT.\n\nThere's a lot more to the story, especially the part about how APPL is almost surely the company that has anonymously invested \\~$450 Million in GSAT already.  More on that:\n\n[https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/globalstar-echostar-take-starring-roles-in-5g-mysteries/d/d-id/775701](https://www.lightreading.com/satellite/globalstar-echostar-take-starring-roles-in-5g-mysteries/d/d-id/775701)\n\nAnd of course there's outer space theme of the AAPL announcement\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/24/iphone-14-event-invite-artwork/](https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/24/iphone-14-event-invite-artwork/)\n\nSo, I'm gonna YOLO this mofo until at least next Wed. afternoon...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ururj9xdv5l91.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e39c718afeb6d6ae11b907ee82857932bc5b90\n\n[original post lost the two photos.  here they are...](https://preview.redd.it/vff1yhxdv5l91.png?width=1760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9832bafde207793cff8fe738e6578aebf9e8c6b8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As of end of 9\\/1.

    "selftext": "A far cry from the usual posts of 0DTE and. $BBBY and other extremely high risk options. The more I read about apple the more the company seems like it is effortlessly ahead of its competitors. Their ability to poach other markets is unique. Surveys suggest the apple car is even more popular than Tesla\u2019s. Simultaneously have exceeded a 50% share of the mobile phone market. Their watchful waiting in the electric car market, in my opinion, is going to pay off massively. I do not necessarily agree ethically with this company or other monopolies like it, however, the relative stability of the investment, even though it won\u2019t return 280% in a year, I believe it can be even more attractive than punts and other gambling activities, especially when you combine it with other consequential trades like a $TSLA short. I still gamble on meme stocks however I have learnt 10-20% is ok, but not 100% and I certainly think a lot of money can be saved in the process.\n\nDisclaimer; this is my opinion and personal beliefs, this does not constitute investment advice and dyodd \n\nInterested to hear what people think",

    "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)\n\nI'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:\n\n1. Earnings\n2. Major Economic Events\n3. My Watchlist\n4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\n**Earnings this week that I will play**\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow i play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don\u2019t  go over 5% size on any earning\u2019s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - GitLabs - $GTLB\n\n* DevOps software company\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) &amp; Revenue $94m\n* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently\n* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings\n* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.\n* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)\n* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish\n\n**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - NIO inc - $NIO:\n\n* EV car manufacturer\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST\n* Estimate eps ($0.17) &amp; revenue $1.45b\n* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.\n* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings\n* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY\n* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting\n* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one\n\nAfter Close - Gamestop - $GME\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) &amp; Revenue $1.27B\n* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.\n* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings\n* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY\n* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss\n\n**Thursday 8 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - Docusign - $DOCU\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m\n* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings\n* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week\n* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here\n\n**Friday 9 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - Kroger - $KR\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m\n* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings\n* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only\n\n**Major Economic events this week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2\n\nSo  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug\n\nWednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July\n\n12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech\n\nThursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech\n\nFriday\n\n10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories\n\n12:30 - Fed Walker Speech\n\nAs  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.\n\nMarket  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

Multiplied by the vega of 0.001, represents $0.14 / share of the 09/09 2P value. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to overcome that $0.14 / share drop due to IV crush, the price of the stock would need to move about 0.36 to \\~$1.77. \n\nDivide the price move attributed to IV crush by the delta.  \n\n\n0.14 / -0.383 = -$0.365  \n\n\n$2.14 - $0.365 = $1.775\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you think the price of GSAT will be below $1.775 after the announcement, you should buy 09/09 2P.   \n\n\nIf you think the price of GSAT will be above $1.775 after the announcement, you should sell the 09/09 2P.",

    "title": "Why I believe DOCU will tank following earnings this week all the way into 2023",
    "selftext": "Elevator pitch:\n\nDOCU is one of the Covid stocks that has already fallen alot (75% YTD) but it still sports a P/S of 5 on a negative GAAP operating margin and EPS. This segment has very low barrier of entry and cost of changing to a competitor. There are very strong (potential) competitors that can leverage huge platform effects (MSFT, AAPL, ADBE etc.). Currently DOCU has very attractive gross margins which likely will be eroded by competition. If they cannot be GAAP positive now, it will only get worse.\n\nGrowth is slowing substantially, so far the CAGR and YoY growth numbers look quite but soon will deteriorate based on recent quarters. If the growth trajectory has slowed further in Q2 which is likely, the stock will drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Growth:**\n\nTop line growth has almost halted over the last months, down to only $8m in Q1 FY23. Moreover, Billings which take into account contract liabilities have declined in Q3 FY22 and Q1 FY23 already.\n\n[The bar chart on the right is not to scale. Source: Docusign investor relation presentation](https://preview.redd.it/1mav8mi0ucm91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26c83d624e98262ceaa35bc555ea41ec200c1a)\n\nCustomer Growth has decelerated substantially, only growing 6% in Q1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Docusign investor relation presentation](https://preview.redd.it/3mw0l3ksucm91.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7893ffda3a8920b7f796f8809cfe4f06d2c26c99)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Profitability**\n\nDOCU sports very high non-GAAP Gross Margins of &gt;80%. While this is an impressive number, it is not surprising as it sells a pure non-customized SAAS solution. Currently DOCU benefits from a very advantageous marketing approach where it charges customers on a per-signature model. A key risk is that competitors may offer a flatrate model which would offer six or seven figure savings to large MNC customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jwsgj1ovcm91.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dda1929caa241f2a79346796de2978f29522769\n\nDOCU is FCF positive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kq8ilq1wcm91.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c82b314909d08ca2f54b773d8dbb8ccecc3b364e\n\nHowever the core issue is stock based compensation and other cost that Management excludes in Non-GAAP results. overall, this results in negative GAAP operating margins\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dj6up53jwcm91.png?width=1447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589881588f3a06a91b28126b850b1c6d574ad74e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion DOCU currently is investing heavily in growth on a steeply diminishing returns basis. It seems that customer acquisition cost are increasing rapidly and Sales is consuming most of the FCF generated by the business\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stock based compensation (SBC)**\n\nin 2021 DOCU paid its employees ca. 245m SBC while this has increased to 350m in FY 2022. In Q1 FY23, SBC has increased to 95m which results in a minimum of 380m if Headcount &amp; compensation stays flat. However, HC has increased 25% over FY 22 so it can be expected that growth will continue and thus SBC.\n\nSBC is a helpful tool to manage cash burn for a growth company with expanding market capitalization and rising stock price. However, on declining market cap it poses additional dilutive downward pressure on stock price.\n\nExample:\n\nAt the current market cap of ca. 10bn, an annualized SBC of 500m will represent a dilution of 5%. The same SBC would have only meant a 1% dilution one year ago when the market cap was circa 50bn. Should the stock decline further towards 5bn, SBC will dilute by 10%.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhile DOCU is as fundamentally profitable (non-GAAP) venture without debt and a robust balance sheet. Currently it is the leader in this field, however the hurdles of entry are low and competitors like MSFT could offer the product as part of their existing platform (MS Office) which would make DOCU obsolete for many customers.\n\nFurther, it seems the current pricing model where customers pay per signature seems very advantageous for DOCU as the marginal cost of each signature tends to be zero. However, it can be expected that competitors will offer flatrate models (as is customary with more mature SAAS solutions) which will put high margin pressure on DOCU.\n\nTherefor I rate this a sell. I will open a short position today as I expect this stock to trend towards a 5bn valuation which would put it at a 10 FY22 FCF multiple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**:\n\nThe company is not fundamentally flawed and could convert into a profitable business if Sales and SBC cost are managed.\n\nThe company is still relatively small with 2bn revenue and may be able to recover its growth trajectory.\n\nIf growth stocks experience another rally, DOCU will certainly be one of the potential winners.",

    "selftext": "**TL/DR** *I like the stock !* \ud83d\ude80\n \nAllright listen up retards, and listen well. I'm an OG and I have some hard to swallow truth for you. This sub has been overtaken by nefarious actors, bots and actual retards since the GME drama. Squeeze this. Squeeze that. Squeeze my fucking dick and fuck betting on lame has-been retail companies and fucking silver. \n \nIt's time we reclaim this sub and start posting proper autistic bets and DD again.\n \nNow, for those of you cowboys with at least a braincell remaining, boys do I got a bet for you. Something asymetrical and long term. *ewww, long term*, I hear you say? Well, perhaps I can change your mind about that!\n \nAs many here may already know, AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is a pre-revenue company aiming to deliver world-wide satellite-based direct-to-cellphone broadband. That means 2G/3G/4G/5G all over the world, from space, on the device in your hands right now. No more dead spots.\n \nI could talk for hours of the benefits and desirability of this service, the adressable market of billions, their partnerships and MOUs for distribution through cell-phone service providers, their 2400 patents, their amazing CEO and how he personally funded ASTS' beginnings, the marvels of technology they have built, how stupidly faster than GSAT IRDM AAPL and starlink it will be, how they launched yesterday their first satellite and are about to demonstrate their tech in the coming weeks, etc., but I'm going to take you by the sentiments. *Let's talk money*.\n \nASTS plans to deploy 168 sats. Sats will cost somewhere around 16M and launches 5M. Each sat will be able to give 1.8M GB per month. \n \n*Yes, but how much is a GB of space internet worth?* I hear you ask?\n \nWell I kid you not, Globalstar and Iridium are managing to sell their GB for more than *2000$* a pop. That's fucking right. And they're slow af, not even comparable.\n \nNow, for the sake of pessimism (\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.\n \nOnce the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**\n\nYeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.\n \nIf we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. \n \nThat means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.\n \nSo here's the bet. **&gt;**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\n \nPosition: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.\n \nDisclosure: Forward looking statements, Not financial advice, Do your own DD, don't trust strangers on the internet, Gambling is risky, yaddi yaddi yadda.\n \nNote: For those curious to learn more check out r/ASTSpacemobile",

    "selftext": "So this is the continuation of the first post (months ago)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w8z1x3/bear\\_market\\_studies\\_part\\_1\\_sp\\_500\\_ta\\_and\\_cot/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w8z1x3/bear_market_studies_part_1_sp_500_ta_and_cot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nYou'll better read it before this one because I won't repeat any intro or info explanations ( I'm lazy af)\n\nif you're looking for an essay about nothing, then you may wanna check r/stocks\n\n[chart 1: short\\/long ratio ](https://preview.redd.it/k8m382ov7eq91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61372c3cb82d5f3cba7e225414f4813677d9dd23)\n\nCOT report data: [https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm)\n\nchart 1: MM= market makers, HF= hedge funds\n\nIn my first analysis I talked about the COT report and the fact that hedge funds were extremely net short: I was expecting 408 as the top of the last bear market rally for multiple reasons, but it actually topped at 430\n\nThe chart 1 shows how MM were positioned for the first dump at SPY ATH\n\nafter the first bear market rally HF were net short (3.2) but then they closed most of their short positions, prob they weren't expecting the long donwtrend... meanwhile MM short ratio was stable but still high\n\nafter the second minor bear market rally ( flat channel/ were QT formally started) HF loaded short positions (2.4) and then they took profit during the dump (1.6)\n\nMM short ratio has been stable at lower levels, while they loaded a crazy amount of long positions during the flat formation and especially during the third bear market rally (chart 2 /1)\n\nhedge funds did exactly the opposite: they started accumulating short positions from the bottom (chart 2/1), short ratio went from 2 to 4.9\n\n\\*meantime institutionals positioning has been stable during the whole year, apparently they just try to stay market neutral (chart 2/A)\n\nfrom SPY 410 to 430, HF loaded up on spread positions (long + short) (chart 2/B), they expected a final pump so they hedged themself\n\nas soon the market dumped from 430, HF took profits: ratio went from 5.7 to 4.3 (chart 2/3) and they added some several spread positions (chart 2/2) = they expected the last mini rally, and it actually happened\n\n[chart 2: COT report](https://preview.redd.it/hw94jgzmbeq91.jpg?width=1639&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33cad8bba2b6bdfd3a2e52d4c7f424d6c63ea08b)\n\nnow, the last COT report shows how HF closed the biggest amount of short positions of the entire year (chart 2/3) and MM closed all spread positions they've opened during the last dump (to hedge themself since they were still bullish, ratio was 0.4) (chart 2/4)\n\nfrom my point of view this means that they're not positioned for a real crash in the short term, also, HF are still holding a lot of spread positions (chart 2/5) to cover themself from another momentum rally\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[chart 3: SPX 1d](https://preview.redd.it/nbmwsij80fq91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d23cc751a09828dec05d44a7545832766ab48da3)\n\nThe first major major bear market rally ended +11% vs last one +16%, thanks to AAPL at almost ATH ( at some point it weighted 7.3%, highest in SPY history)\n\nthe last bear market rally ended  at 430 resistance( from May price action) into the lowest volume zone of the year (chart 4), that was a real signal for the upcoming dump...\n\nafter those rallies both downtrend are structured through the same standard deviations, up 2.5 / down 2 (not trendlines)\n\nIn the first downtrend every momentum rally (from 1/4h RSI oversold) ended as soon it touched the upper deviation: 3 mini rallies, meanwhile in the current downtrend we only had 1 rally...\n\nthe last rally ended into the 410 resistance, which is also the POC of the volume profile (red line), Fibo 0.5 (Fibo retracements work perfectly though this downtrend)and same RSI levels as the flat channel QT structure\n\nHF short/long ratio was higher than 2020 = 5.9 (chart 1)\n\nthe dump was so predictable as I warned in the daily thread...\n\n[chart 4: SPY volume](https://preview.redd.it/ehuofawpbeq91.jpg?width=979&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c835417023dc68ea54c4bd610a8bdfb5370b77be)\n\n**SPECULATIVE CONSIDERATIONS**\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning HF are not positioned for a flash crash, either a major rally so I expect the market to complete the well known pattern \"pump then dump again\" to crush most of call/puts at short term\n\n[chart 5: SPX 4h](https://preview.redd.it/pex3fwrcugq91.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bcf8772587e0df4700a6694d58ae44a7b0c4c7)\n\nThe market is gonna take some days (at 4H RSI oversold) to complete the donwward  or flat consolidation before the pump (+4/5%) to the upper deviation 380, it will give the impression of a  SPY double bottom... then dump again -7% (as the other dumps) to 350 (Fibo retracement) (chart 5)\n\nLast SPY bottom is not a real resistance, it was just a fakeout back then. The real resistence was SPY 372/374 (from 2021) where the market bounced on the 9.1 CPI day with a tremendous V reversal, then started the major rally\n\nthe market broke that support with a gap down like nothing\n\nAt the end it will be a -18% correction from the last top, same % as the first downtrend\n\nMarket will be oversold on the weekly RSI at 350 = flat consolidation + major bear market rally\n\nAnd as I exposed in the first post, market has never broken the 30 weekly RSI since Covid flashcrash and 2008, it takes a real black swan (Gyna vs Taiwan? )\n\nAlso, the TINA effect (There Is No Alternative) for big money will pump the market again +10/15%...\n\nI will expose that in that next post with some extra info about inflation and SPY fundamentals, to much TA for today eh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLTR:**\n\nIn the 1929 bear market (-86% from ATH) the calories per capita have dramatically decreased = less fat people\n\nApparently, JPOW will use his *tools*  to solve the problem of our overweight society *...*",

    "title": "Apple Ditches iPhone Production Increase After Demand Falters",
    "selftext": "Apple Inc. is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based electronics maker has told suppliers to pull back from efforts to increase assembly of the iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year, said the people, asking not to be named as the plans are not public. Instead, the company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple\u2019s original forecast this summer, the people said.\n\nDemand for higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions, according to some of the people. In at least one case, an Apple supplier is shifting production capacity from lower-priced iPhones to premium models, they added.\n\nApple shares fell about 3% in pre-market trading in New York on Wednesday. US stock-index futures were also lower.\n\nIn Taipei, key chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 2.2% and Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. was down 2.9%, amid a wide selloff of electronics suppliers. ASML Holding NV, maker of advanced chipmaking gear, dropped as much as 3.2% in Amsterdam.\n\nApple Suppliers Drop as Firm Said to Ditch IPhone Output Boost\n\nApple had upgraded its sales projections in the weeks leading up to the iPhone 14 release and some of its suppliers had started making preparations for a 7% boost in orders.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market, is in an economic slump that\u2019s hit its domestic mobile device makers and also affected the iPhone\u2019s sales. Purchases of the iPhone 14 series over its first three days of availability in China were 11% down on its predecessor the previous year, according to a Jefferies note on Monday.\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ditches-iphone-production-increase-011918295.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-ditches-iphone-production-increase-011918295.html)\n\nApple (AAPL) is down 3.71% premarket. This comes after the news that the company abandons plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year following a decline in demand. How much further do you think AAPL will fall?",

    "selftext": "[Looking for Cheaper](https://preview.redd.it/dpjiu3nnewq91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739668f9c1c47ff55d08ae7491f3bef30e310c9b)\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI wrote a post not too long ago talking about how we shouldn't fight the fed. In the comments I describe the short positions that had been building against $TSLA and $AAPL. I think a lot of you now understand why Wallstreet was gearing up for war on retail's two favorite stocks.\n\nNow I am going to tell you what their goal probably is and to summarize what the economic trends we're seeing in the consumer based on earnings reports.\n\nBuckle up, you probably want to both hear and not hear what I have to say.\n\n# Inflation -- People Are Making Decisions, \"Do I buy luxury brand or do I buy store brand?\"\n\nSo, inflation. The Big I-Word. It's been a disaster for the market. A genie that should never have been let out of the bottle, but it is and we're not done with it yet (clearly). There are a lot of signs emerging that it's affecting the consumer. While it's not affecting the net spend from consumers--yet--it is affecting their choices.\n\nTake $WMT. WMT saw a pretty good upswing in it's earnings last report with quite a good beat, but why is this? Aren't things horrible for retail stores? Well, if you think so, you'd be right. But one person's loss is another person's gain. When you're entering tough times and things are expensive you do what you have to do, you buy cheaper. You go for store brand products. Instead of shopping at your local high end Bashes grocery store or Super Target, you hit up Wal Mart, Costco, places that have their entire model built on stretching a consumer/shopper's dollar to the max.\n\nThis was our first big key to what's going on. Let's talk about the next.\n\n# The Bullwhip Effect\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What the Books say is happening. This is how you get a glut of inventory](https://preview.redd.it/2evme75dewq91.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f08fa1a17a7c191d0bf059cff198850d6fb56243)\n\nBullwhip Effect -- AKA Covid \"BUY IT ALL! WE'RE STUCK AT HOME!\"\n\nWe're seeing a huge bullwhip effect in the market. Places are being flooded with inventory. Yes, this is old news, but it is also current news. $TGT's last quarter was the perfect example for how this god awful situation plays out. Companies ordered a ridiculous amount during the pandemic because all of us sat at home on our phones ordering everything we ever wanted in our lives. Because stocks were so low, places started to double, triple up on their orders in order to try and meet a new high demand that they were forecasting.\n\nWell, it didn't last forever. Plus... this didn't help...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yeah... that's your stuff out there.](https://preview.redd.it/p50gpamfewq91.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b835ca06f519998080f9c16d8315ad5ef5c843ae)\n\nShip Congestion. That's your stuff out there. Sitting for months.\n\nThis stuff sat on boats for freaking months. You might say, 'Hey, Tay\\_tay86, I know all this crap. Why are you telling me old news?\" Because guess what, it's here now. That stuff has been unloaded and sent to the stores.\n\nBut guess what? It's freaking late. Like really late.\n\nSo what does a company like $TGT do? Well, in their case they list on clearance. It costs money to have this crap around. Plus if it sits too long, it has to be completely written off. You know, red tag 80-90% clearance aka please get it out of my store. That gave $TGT a fat \\~45% cut in EPS because they have to eat all of their costs associated with producing and then shipping that item at stupid high prices to your fat ass. If it takes too long, they get shellacked.\n\n# Here comes out next challenger... Nike. $NKE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here we go again...](https://preview.redd.it/uzj64zvgewq91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=177d873f7aa902a06d9ad318ac66bbac91030e0a)\n\nOur old friend. Mr Highly Engineered Shoes Guyz\n\n$NKE reported after the bell today. All eyes were definitely on them. They've been talking about this one all over the place so going in, it's a hot topic. Well, it's a pretty bad story.\n\nThere's a lot of similarities here. I highly encourage you to listen to their entire call.\n\nTheir margin's are compressed AF. 22% drop in profits is a pretty dire warning to unprofitable companies or ones that are barely profitable.\n\n1. Any time a CEO/CFO is throwing out catch phrases after every BAD result is a sure fire sign that they are trying to distract you from the car wreck that is their report. I Counted at least 4-5 times of 'We're still the super cool choice for shoes' (Paraphrasing, clearly)\n2. They suddenly have too much inventory. Sounds familiar? It should. That's why they are clearing out of the stock afterhours. They are forecasting a repeat of what $TGT just had. $NKE may have squeaked by at 0.93 EPS today, but the next one could be a real gut punch as they try to clear these shoes. Even worse than $TGT, they sell season specific items. This means some of this crap is probably summer oriented when we're going into fall and winter. Yeah, not a good situation. It could potentially be WORSE than what $TGT just experienced. Combine that with the drop in profits and Fx challenges, you've got a real problem.\n3. China revenue dropped. I feel like that one didn't get the highlight it deserves. The CEO kept trying to amp up that China is hungry for sports themed stuff that they sell, but yet their revenue there dropped 13%. Didn't they roll out a lot of direct to consumer options? Well apparently they aren't biting. This is a very eerie warning.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, let's start to summarize. Hopefully you're still reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Cracking Of Apple](https://preview.redd.it/uppjfyxhewq91.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b327e0f44c102a34631d00e2fd295a0f94fd33aa)\n\n# The Cracking of $AAPL\n\nWe've had MULTIPLE warnings about China's demand for our multinational in the past few weeks. Let's list them out:\n\n1. FedEx reported economic weakness in China. If anyone knows how things are going, it's the folks who are delivering stuff that businesses are selling.\n2. Nike is reporting weaker revenue from China (where their stuff is basically made)\n3. Apple is supposedly pulling back a prior manufacturing target by 5-10% due to a lack of demand in places like, you guessed it, China\n\nNow apple's debatable because there's some reports that the Max is doing fine. However, I think that's probably a bullish dream. Their mainstream model is only doing as well as the first.\n\nWhat's at fault? Honestly, probably the chips and overall market. Nothing inside the phone is dramatically different. It's a big nothing burger and there's not a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you do want to, you might as well shell out for the Max to actually get something.\n\nI believe this is going to result in **a net loss of sales because not everyone will choose to buy expensive when the mainstream model is subpar.** **The upgrade is... minor.**\n\nThis is not a homerun for Apple. Wallstreet probably feels very confident about this behind closed doors, but not in public. That's why they've been building short positions against Apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Closing Time](https://preview.redd.it/tje90u9kewq91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbb27790f23e8301f7f07db945c1d28d76405ef5)\n\n# Closing out\n\nAlright, so let's close this baby out. I know a lot won't read this, but hey, hope you do. If you had read my last one you would have made a killing betting against $AAPL this week.\n\nSo what's the trend we're seeing?\n\n1. **There's too much stuff.**\n2. **Luxuries are not the draw they once were. Things need to be noticeably different to get the $.**\n3. **Because of inflation people (middle class) are choosing to shop at cheaper locations**\n4. **Affordability is top of mind (See CarMax which I am not covering here)**\n\nSo this is it. This is all great for the battle against inflation, but it's bad news bears for your stocks. You're looking at potentially shaky EPS results as we head into this earnings season and the next. These are not single quarter problems. Inventories can take a long time to physically move through the system.\n\nWhich brings me to what this means:\n\nWe're probably going lower in the market.\n\nWall street is coming for retail. They know from all of the data and the clear charts that retail has piled into $AAPL and $TSLA as safety. They are building short positions against it because they have better info than we do. Rumors are already leaking that $TSLA could be approaching weak deliveries for a lot of the same reasons.\n\nYou've got Price and Earnings to every P/E ratio. Price has come down a lot, but now we're going to look at E heading south. There's two ways to skin a company.\n\nLet's talk about $TSLA for a second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Is A Cult](https://preview.redd.it/t0zal9gpewq91.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6922c2439180b2800ab212b5f72dfd1257c23637)\n\n# The Cult Of Tesla\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n1. Look, I don't hide my feelings. I greatly dislike Tesla and their CEO Elon Musk. I don't trust him. I think he manipulates the market and uses it to empty his fans pockets\n2. I think the cars are cheaply made with a lot of flaws.\n3. I don't like cultish love for a human being\n\nElon has made a mistake. That mistake? Making promises he doesn't keep. There's 1 major promise that Elon should have kept: **Making An Affordable EV.**\n\nI am not going to take you through the logic. It's up above. Read this and you'll understand why I am pointing a finger here. These cars are **EXPENSIVE** and they don't offer you a big new thing than the one you already have does. FSD COSTS EXTRA. These are **luxuries**. What do we know about luxuries? People are choosing to buy cheaper. Carmax DIRECTLY said that affordability is on people's mind for car shopping now. **Especially as interest rates soar making car financing WAY more expensive than it was a year ago.**\n\nI believe this is going to bite Elon Musk right in his lying manipulative ass. His way out, pulling a huge rabbit out of the hat. This could happen soon, or it could happen next year, but it's coming for him.\n\n**Keep in mind he's already tilted his hand calling Austin and Berlin's gigafactories cash burning machines.**\n\nJust to add, Elon Musk isn't your friend. He doesn't care about you or your memes at all. He's been the richest man on the planet. He Does Not Care About You. He Doesn't Even Live In The Same 'World' As You.\n\n# Final Words\n\nWall street is coming for Apple. Wall Street is coming for Tesla. They know you're holding it. They are two, massive, giant piggy banks sitting in a market where the bears have eaten everything else alive. Every bear is starting to turn their heads and they are looking directly at a juicy, fat, pair of piggy banks.\n\nWhen it's all done, the market is probably around 3100-3300 unless things get disorderly. I expect these two to lead us lower, because lets be honest, not much else can. These two have 'been holding the market up higher.\n\nFurther disclaimer: I have positions against AAPL and Tesla. I've been rolling them for a while. I won't share my exits, but here's proof that I am in what I say I am. I started these with 3k. Going strong so far.\n\nGood luck out there.

    "title": "VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY",
    "selftext": " Why does volatility increase if liquidity decreases? \n\nAs you know by now, the Fed is reducing liquidity on the market by raising interest rates and reducing the balance sheet and denying many people and businesses access to credit. An important component of volatility is the market cap. For example, if a company has a market cap of 100M, the movement of 50M is sufficient to significantly increase or decrease the stock. If, on the other hand, we want to move the price of a company with 1000 billion market caps, 500 billion will be needed to generate the same movement.\n\n You can therefore pump companies like [$GME (GameStop Corp.)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/gme) but not like [$AAPL (Apple)](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/aapl) \n\nThe companies' market caps have shrunk dramatically this year. \n\nThis means that far less money is needed to move the major indices both down and up. \n\nIn fact, it is much more frequent to see collapses and rises of more than 3% in a single day.\n\n In the chart below ([$SPX500](https://www.etoro.com/it/markets/spx500) daily) you can see the difference between 2021 and 2022. Look at the size of the candles and the fluctuations of 2022 compared to those of 2021. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MY PROFILE](https://etoro.tw/2DGv45L)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzp2gzk85zs91.jpg?width=1843&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=473be23961d335dc69ec66ec69e8f2bac25e206d",

A less than impressive gain since my last update (was up about \\~$12000 realized and unrealized) but whatever the hell it was that happened on CPI day did a number on me. Since many people appear to be having issues with images on Reddit lately, in addition to the above, here's the current positions written out.\n\nI've significantly rebalanced my positions, the account I was using for holding shares has since been switched over to income generating energy plays on oil, natural gas, and uranium. I've also dumped a lot of my index shorts to open a little under $8000 in Apple and Amazon puts.\n\nThe food shortage plays aren't looking great, the harvest came in worse than expected this fall, but I may have gotten the timing for the pricing in of that bad harvest wrong. Will probably look to roll out and add to the agricultural positions to next spring/summer.  Ag ETF positions omitted from picture because AutoMod didn't like them.\n\n**C0RN - 27.60 (last update 26.91)**\n\n10 2/17/23 31c\n\n**W3AT - 8.75 (last update 8.82)**\n\n10 1/20/23 17c\n\n20 1/20/23 18c\n\n**S0YB - 26.46 (last update 26.88)**\n\n10 11/18 29c\n\n10 2/17/23 29c\n\n**SPXS - 28.87 (last update 27.14)**\n\n8 11/4 30c\n\n**SPXU - 21.92**\n\n*11 12/16 21c*\n\n**SPY - 357.63 (last update 367.95)**\n\n4 11/18 330p\n\n*7 12/16 300p*\n\n4 3/17/23 255p\n\n4 1/19/24 210p\n\n**AAPL - 138.83**\n\n*100 12/16 80p*\n\n*100 12/16 70p*\n\n*50 6/16 60p*\n\n**AMZN - 106.90**\n\n*50 12/16 65p*\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6n41t/just_sold_my_house_heres_the_market_crash_and/) to the post laying out my general thesis on this play. And since this somehow became a thing in the comments of that post - yeah, that's not a straight screenshot of any of my brokerage accounts, I put the images from Schwab, Fidelity, and ETrade together into one picture on MS Paint because I've got no interest in sharing my full accounts or account numbers with the internet.\n\nI'm not a fan of diamond handing options, blew up my account once like that, now I take profits. The *italicized* positions are new since last update, and were bought with profits from closing stuff.\n\nI added the Apple and Amazon shorts because they're the two shittiest, most overpriced companies in the market, along with Tesla (tessie is going to die hard and fast once the HF's and institutions that are long on it start blowing up). Apple's consumer graph looks incredibly similar to Nike's, and well, look what happened after their last ER. Amazon is currently a great company (AWS) tied to a shitberg of money losing (everything else AMZN does). Jassy was a horrifically bad choice to head up Amazon as a whole because he doesn't understand what their marketplace's competitive advantage actually is or how it's being destroyed. Price target on AAPL = 45ish, on AMZN 25ish. Their PE's are 23 and 96 respectively.  Both AAPL and AMZN also currently have Unionizing issues that are just going to keep increasing.  Sooner or later TSLA will get unionized as well, at least at the factories.\n\nI'd like to have more Amazon and any Tesla short positions, but right now I can't find a good entry on them, so I'll keep waiting until I do.\n\nMy optimistic case for global harvests is now -20%. Every international analysis I've looked at points to excess production from countries that don't have it to make up the shortfall. Supposedly the US is/has prepared a brief on just how bad it is, and that is not available to the public. I am no longer sure this will be priced in before my current options expire. Looking at potentially rolling my current ones out about 6 months, will add to them if I do.\n\nAs per one of my [previous DD's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/), we're now seeing increased migration and violence around the world, with a second competing currency bloc forming primarily around Russia and China. There are some other countries that get lumped in with that, but I'm doubtful they all stick, given the tensions between many of them.\n\nI'll take a second to recommend [u/Peruvian\\_Bull](https://www.reddit.com/u/Peruvian_Bull/) 's DD posts on the collapse of the dollar as global reserve currency, there has been absolute chaos and carnage in the Forex markets lately and his stuff from over a year ago is pretty much playing out perfectly.\n\nChina's economy is basically a zombie being propped up by threats of violence to banking and real estate executives and local government officials. Once the China National Party Congress meeting ends (runs from 10/16 though 10/22) the wheels probably come off in a very, very bad way.\n\nTehran continues to have increasing protests after the Basij (religious police, everyone hates them) murdered a 22 year old woman for not wearing a hijab. Food prices are now higher than they were during the Arab Spring. These protests aren't as big of a deal as some in the west want to pretend, but they're a bigger deal and have more popular support than you'd think from the press coverage (lack) on them. Food prices and inflation are high enough this could easily take a wild turn very unexpectedly and very fast in Iran/KSA/Iraq/Syria/Egypt. All of these countries have large populations of young men and the temperature will get very hot in them in a couple of months. (the basic formula for societal unrest is lots of young men + poor job/future prospects + hot weather + high prices = violence)\n\nRussia continues to experience issues with it's plan to draft people, and continues losing in Ukraine. Western leaders appear to be pulling a repeat of the Treaty of Versailles mistakes of just thinking they can grind a country down indefinitely instead of giving them a way out.  The Ukrainian provinces currently being fought over were in open rebellion/civil war for years before Russia invaded, and would make some nice \"buffer states\" in any peace deal.  Russia's conventional army is basically gone at this point, going forwards they'll be fighting asymmetrically with cyber attacks and hits on infrastructure leading to spikes in energy prices or big drops in markets.\n\nIndia has halted Rice exports, after shutting down Wheat exports earlier this summer. California's Rice crop is, to put it mildly, toast. The poorest people eat rice - this one is going to get bad going forward.",

    "selftext": "We all know that max pain can be a big indicator of whether or not you options will print on an easily manipulated small-cap stock, where hedge funds and market makers will almost always pin the share price to max pain at expiry. Does this hold true with large caps too? Or are they just too big to manipulate? I mean, I know the whole damn thing is rigged, but all other factors aside, does max pain generally reflect a price range where a stock is likely to close on a Friday?\n\nIn this week\u2019s option chain for AAPL, the OI on puts is through the roof. Puts way WAY out weigh calls under $145. Does this make it all but pointless to gamble on puts under $145 expiring this week on AAPL? Or is is feasible that enough of those puts may be owned by institutions, that we could see some heavy shorting towards the end of the week to make many of those expire ITM?",

    "title": "(DD) The AAPL\u2019s About To Rot",
    "selftext": " \n\n## Aapl is entirely fucked.\n\nThis is not in my usual wheelhouse of plays (tiny companies, under-priced relative to their potential), so hey everything you read from here-on out could be wrong in a thousand ways. Anyway\u2026 \n\nLet\u2019s imagine you find $2.3T in your jacket pocket this morning. Fuck that is a lot of money. Guess you better invest it well. You decide you\u2019re going to buy AAPL. **At $2.3T you could buy all of it and take it private** (well, not realistically as the more you bought the higher the price would go, etc). \n\nRegardless, you are now out $2.3T in cash upfront but you bought Apple, all of it. You control the entire company, and **you get to keep all the profits as your personal income forever.** \n\nCool, that must be a lot of money, right? Let\u2019s see. Over the last year that\u2019s - oh wow -[ **$100B of net income**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/net-income) **you get to keep every year! Amazing!!**\n\nExcept wait. $100B divided by your investment of $2.3T\u2026 is **only a 4.3% yield on your investment**\u2026 and that\u2019s **only IF apple continues making $100B**\n\n1. \u2026 into a coming global recession\u2026 \n2. \u2026while the drop in international currencies relative to the dollar is already going to reduce its revenues and net profits in dollar denominated terms \u2026 (At least most of their revenue comes through in USD right? **Nope.** [Non-US revenue makes up over 60% of Apple's revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263435/non-us-share-of-apples-revenue/)) (At least they\u2019re hedged right? **Nope** [\u201cUS tech giants slashed FX hedges before EM currencies plunged\u201d](https://www.eurofinance.com/news/us-tech-giants-slashed-fx-hedges-before-em-currencies-plunged/#:~:text=Consider%20computer%20giant%20Apple%2C%20which,net%20investments%20in%20foreign%20subsidiaries) **Oops)**\n3. \u2026and don\u2019t forget that $100B reflects an uncharacteristic bump probably driven by one-time massive phenomena (stimulus iphones and work-from-home macbook pros).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Aapl saw a revenue bump due during the pandemic](https://preview.redd.it/xmz39v4ge0v91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b61da64cbd1a7046fb1d93a8732aff4bd6651e)\n\n \n\nSo for buying aapl, you get a 4.3% return on your capital every year, with some risk that apple\u2019s profits don\u2019t sustain. And **you have to run the world\u2019s largest, most complicated, business with a massively global tight-ass supply chain**.. Just to earn 4.3% on your fucking money.\n\n**Or\u2026**\n\nYou could just buy this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0xaddpke0v91.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b820153591074b7a01da344b92b99282bba292c0\n\n \n\nYou could buy the **least riskiest financial asset on the planet** and get 4.22% for the next 10 years, guaranteed. \n\nSo \n\n**Option 1:** Use $2.3T to buy Apple to hope and get the 4.3% a year assuming Apple makes $100B in net income\n\n**Option 2:** Put $2.3T into 10y treasuries and get 3.827% guaranteed\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nOh, and if you happen to be insane enough to **still** choose Apple, guess what? The Fed has just told you that they\u2019re going to keep raising rates another 125 bps, which means that the 10Y yield may not even have topped out yet.\n\nSo at some point the situation might look like this:\n\nOption 1: Buy and Manage Apple to hope **and get the 4.3%** a year every year\n\nOption 2: Buy 10y treasuries **and get 5.0%.**\n\nThere may be some smooth-brained trillionaires that choose option 1 in the first scenario above, but there is 0 rational reason to choose to buy Apple if rates are going above 5.0%. \n\n**Oh yeah, and that 4.3% rate? That\u2019s basically what P/E tells you. Apple\u2019s P/E is 1 / 0.043 = 23** (this is not the exact value as I rounded the 4.3 above).\n\nAnyway, so you\u2019re earning a 4.3% yield now, i.e. you\u2019re paying a P/E of 23 now, which is **less than a .1% premium on treasuries.** \n\n**\u201cMaybe that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u201d you say in your one-nut voice.** \n\n**No, that\u2019s not how it\u2019s always been, you sidewalk-pooper.** \n\nHere\u2019s Apple\u2019s P/E history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1naqzdoe0v91.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f431a97c453d968df6d472b7efb5dde3d998a590\n\n \n\n**Apple\u2019s P/E is historically high**, and **therefore your yield for owning Apple is historically low.** \n\nA risk asset that is at lows for yield in terms of recent history when yields on the risk-free asset are high in terms of recent history is a bad combination. \n\nYou could argue Apple\u2019s P/E is not that high, since it was close to 23 in December of 2019. **But then 10y treasury yields were less than 2% and on their way down**, so you were getting more than 2% extra on your money vs buying treasuries (which I would argue is too little as well).\n\n**The only way Apple\u2019s valuation lasts here is if a) the 10y treasury yield drops or b) apple significantly grows its earnings.**  \n\nAnd if it misses earnings? Not only will the \u201cE\u201d come down but the P/E ratio will drop as well, **until investors get back to at least a 2% premium over 10y treasuries.**\n\nThat\u2019s a yield of 5.8% against today\u2019s 3.8% paid on the risk-free side, which means a P/E ratio of **16,** corresponding to a **31% drop in Apple\u2019s share price just if P/E contracts to where it should be given 10y yields**, and more than that if Apple\u2019s forward revenue is anything less than $100B. \n\nA 31% share drop puts it at $100. \n\nSo, I\u2019m buying puts. Apple is scheduled to release earnings on the 27th, so I\u2019ve got some puts for after earnings and then some 2023 puts as well. \n\nOne could also short aapl on its own, short it relative to the S&amp;P / 10yr treasuries, or short leap calls. I\u2019ve got a mix of positions with the nearest-dated being 145p 10/28. I\u2019m also saving some capital to short after earnings, particularly if earnings are weak. \n\n## Counterpoints\n\n* Apple is still buying back stock. Fewer shares available + same passive net inflows = Apple gets bid up by passive. However, unclear whether it fits fiduciary duty for Apple to continue to buy back shares given yields currently. \n* Apple\u2019s revenues and earnings could increase with the release of the new gen iphone models &amp; other hardware (macbooks, etc.); or their market share could grow for any other reason\n* They could release a car, a new AR/VR headset, or some other product that lifts revenue meaningfully\n* For some reason, people spend more on in-app purchases than they did during the pandemic when they were stuck at home\n* Apple grows revenue from its ever-increasing portfolio of connected products (airpods, etc.)\n* Apple is at its core a pretty good company (but the stock is high), so people could divert money to Apple in a flight to safety. \n\nTell me other reasons why this is dumb. I\u2019m all ears.",

After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases.

    "title": "Apple Earnings (AAPL): A Sensible Discussion",
    "selftext": "Sup Ladies and Gentleman, and all you other degenerates.  I would like to discuss the event that is this Thursday: Apple Earnings.  I know nothing about the company products really which is why I've tagged it a discussion.  I am not some neckbeard fanboy who has such a poor understanding of technology, he has to get a baby proofed computer with an outrageous monitor stand,  nor am I a yuppie wanna-be artist with my head stuck up my ass sitting at a coffee shop waiting for someone to compliment the apple logo on my devices and clothes.  Personally, I am bearish.  Personally, I am an idiot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:\n\n1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.\n2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**\n3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble.\n4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone.\n5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.\n6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do.\n7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See Biggest Square](https://preview.redd.it/5y2tsbc7mlv91.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=503fc2604fa460ae6af4d47b04f88ee261dd24c9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. Apple Still Hasn't Fallen Off the Tree\n\nOn my 1Y chart on Robinhood it says:\n\n* Apple down 1.41%\n* Microsoft down 21.94%\n* SPY down 17.13%\n* Amazon down 29.93%\n* Google down 27.26%\n* Snapchat down 86.93%\n* Bitcoyne down 67.9%\n* Silver down 21.16%\n* My portfolio down 69.69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is some historical reference going all the way back pre-covid:\n\n|Announcement Date|Fiscal Quarter End|Estimated EPS|Actual EPS|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10/27/2022||$1.25|$????|\n|2022-07-28|2022-06-30|$1.14|$1.20|\n|2022-04-28|2022-03-31|$1.43|$1.52|\n|2022-01-27|2021-12-31|$1.89|$2.10|\n|2021-10-28|2021-09-30|$1.24|$1.24|\n|2021-07-27|2021-06-30|$1.00|$1.30|\n|2021-04-28|2021-03-31|$1.00|$1.40|\n|2021-01-27|2020-12-31|$1.41|$1.68|\n|2020-10-29|2020-09-30|$0.69|$0.73|\n|2020-07-30|2020-06-30|$0.51|$0.65|\n|2020-04-30|2020-03-31|$0.52|$0.64|\n\nYou see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Chips\n\nNot sure what computers have to do with potatoes, but we are dealing with a bag of Lays right now.  You know how you buy a bag in line at the store, and then you open it and there is like 6 chips and air?  We are in a chip shortage and it is affecting everything.  I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.  Similar to NVidias video cards when mining with GPU's was made obsolete.  There is a saturated online market for apple products that apple will not see any revenue from.",

    "selftext": " \n\nWall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market\u2019s most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy\u2019s health.\n\nOn the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) \u2013 which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index \u2013 will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.\n\nA bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.\n\n \n\nEarnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.\n\nFor this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.\n\nEarnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn\u2019t leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla\u2019s revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nOn Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.\n\nStrength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback\u2019s 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.\n\nThat headwind is expected to show up in Amazon\u2019s results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate\u2019s revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that \u201cforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs\" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.\n\n  \n\nFor Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted \u201cdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.\u201d\n\nMeta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech\u2019s 72-hour earnings rollout.\n\nOther notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.\n\nIn economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings \u2013 which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER\u2019s panel of economists must officially declare a recession.\n\nEconomic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.\n\n \n\nAccording to Pantheon Economics\u2019 Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.\n\n\u201cBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,\u201d Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.",

    "selftext": "Long story short I\u2019m finding these 6 stocks to be very attractive currently for the following reasons: \n\n1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.\n\n2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don\u2019t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they\u2019re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.\n\n3. For the ones that are less \u201cgold plated\u201d when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. \n\nI feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. \n\nRe: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they\u2019re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. \n\nHence, I feel there\u2019s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value. Thoughts?",

They make other smartphones too\u00a0 but the bulk of their revenue comes from Apple, I think.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Disappointing-iPhone-14-14-Plus-sales-allegedly-prompt-Foxconn-to-cut-production-in-favor-of-the-iPhone-14-Pro-14-Pro-Max.658335.0.html \n\nIPhone 14 and and iPhone 14 Max are selling comparatively worse than the Pro models. But since pro models account for less sales since they are 100 to 200$ more, overall sales are down. \n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2022/10/18/iphone-14-plus-demand/amp/ \n\nhttps://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-cuts-iphone-14-plus-production-less-than-two-weeks-after-debut \n\nApple has asked at least assembler to \u201cimmediately halt [iPhone 14 Plus] production.\u201d as they \"reassess\"\nAlso 2\u00a0 Apple suppliers in China that rely on the parts and assemble them into larger modules are also cutting their production 70% and 90% respectively \n\nAccording to Wayne MA's source, these\u00a0 changes are due to demand. Also, he confirms that the Pro and Pro max sales are insignificant compared to the Non-pro devices. \n\nAnother worry is on the wearable of Apple, who are considered the most discretionary as they are usually seen as gifts for others. With inflation this high, people are very likely to cut costs and impact yet another lucrative revenue stream for Apple. \n\n\nIs it finally time for the Apple to fall ?

    "title": "Apple Q4 Earnings Preview: All Eyes On iPhone 14 Sales and Guidance",
    "selftext": "[Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) will release Q4 earnings Thursday after the market. After several disappointing earnings posted by its FAAMG fellows (Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta), a weaker-than-expected quarterly result or guidance will further trigger stocks selling-off mode. \n\nStill, Apple\u2019s current market cap is around $2.4 trillion, with PE 24.65. The stock is down 15.54% YTD, beating S&amp;P 500\u2019s -20%. \n\n**Here's what Wall Street expects:** \n\nrevenue: \u00a0$88.68 billion, 6.4% Y/Y\n\ndiluted EPS: $1.26, up 2% Y/Y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/skr9qr5ddcw91.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cff8e267d0a4159cd3db652d54791eba14f20868\n\nInvestors should mainly focus on the performance of U.S. and Chinese consumers, who contributed 45% and 18% company\u2019s revenue in Q3. The iPhone 14 in other regions such as Europe and Japan saw price increases of 5%-20% compared to last generation due to unfavorable exchange rates and higher costs, however, prices for those two areas remained the same, probably for higher sales. \n\n**iPhone global market share increased further and the Pro series help driving ASP to a record high**\n\nWall Street expects iPhone Q4 revenue to be 42.66 billion, up 10% year-over-year, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 14 series. \n\nResearch firm Canalys reported that global smartphone Q3 sales fell 9% year-on-year, recording third consecutive decline this year. However, Apple was the only vendor in the top five to record positive growth, improving its market share to 18% thanks to relatively resilient demand for iPhones, which includes latest iPhone 14 models.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22viwg3edcw91.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61d9418e2fad3def87e9abad9636cd4b5f255ef5\n\nIt is noted that iPhone 14 went on sale on September 16, a week earlier than 13 series, allowing Apple recorded roughly one-week sales into Q4 results. The initial demand will also set the tone for the December quarter covers the busy holiday shopping period, which typically achieves the highest revenue during the year. \n\nConsumers are more willing to buy costlier \u201cPro\u201d models this time, due to huge improvement compared with 13 Pro Max (equip the latest A16 chip, the first ever 48 MP camera and dynamic island, etc). iPhone 14, the base model, got slight improvements from iPhone 13, but roughly the same price, which failed to capture consumers\u2019 interests. \n\nDue to 14 Pro\u2019s higher shipment proportion and prices, Counterpoint Research estimated that iPhone\u2019s ASP (\u201cAverage Selling Prices\u201d) will rise to a record $892 in the September quarter and $944 in the December quarter, higher than current record $873, achieved in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nBut that also means iPhone's revenue will be mainly supported by two Pro models. And it also raises a question: can big demands for iPhone 14 Pro be sustainable throughout the next year?\n\nCurrently, if someone orders an iPhone 14 Pro 512G online in Los Angles, it will take at least 3-4 weeks, a week shorter compared with same period last month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4rkn3wedcw91.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=082ad301131bd1f3cf1c79b3b075572c8d3b215d\n\nApple hasn\u2019t offered official guidance since 2020, and it may offer this time as well. Investors will be closely watching what Apple says about December quarter, the shopping season during the year. Any forecast or guidance that suggests lighter-than-expected results will be a risk to shares. \u00a0\n\n**Will new** [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) **Watch and AirPods Pro help earnings this time?**\n\nWall Street expects Wearable devices, home and other products Q3 revenue of $ 8.79 billion, flat year-on-year. Accompanying with iPhone 14, Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE were both available on September 16, while Apple Watch Ultra and AirPods Pro II were available on September 23, which will be part of Q4 results as well. In addition, as iPhone 14 sells well, the accessories (cases, chargers) may also see some growth. However, analysts seem less bullish.\n\n\u201cWe believe Wearables are the most discretionary product in Apple\u2019s portfolio and therefore most prone to the pullback we are seeing in consumer electronics spending,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Woodring said in a note.\n\n**Mac may be the shining star even PC demand slows sharply**\n\nWall Street expects Mac revenue for Q4 to reach $9.25 billion, flat Y/Y; iPad revenue will be $7.81 billion, down 5% Y/Y. \n\nIt is noted that Mac revenue for Q3 fell 10% Y/Y and CEO Tim Cook attributed the drop to supply constraints, which means Apple couldn\u2019t make enough computers to meet demand. Now, the supply constraints may not be a serious problem anymore, but demand is.\n\nDeclines continued for the traditional PC market as global shipments totaled 74.3 million units, down 15% Y/Y, during the third quarter of 2022, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Cooling demand and uneven supply have contributed to a year-over-year contraction of 15.0%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8g5uiazfdcw91.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=932b303ea5b74c1b8636058d29fa31999e0c8317\n\n\"Consumer demand has remained muted though promotional activity from the likes of Apple and other players has helped soften the fall and reduce channel inventory by a couple weeks across the board,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers. \"Supply has also reacted to the new lows by reducing orders with Apple being the only exception as their third quarter supply increased to make up for lost orders stemming from the lockdowns in China during the second quarter.\"\n\n**Services revenue may slow further;** [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) **hiked music, TV+ fee first time ever**\n\nIn Q3, Apple's services revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $19.6 billion, the slowest growth rate since 2015, and is expected to slow further this time. Wall Street expects revenue to be $19.96 billion, up 10% year-over-year.\n\nIn July, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri warned investors that while services business would continue to expand, its growth rate would slow from 12% during the June quarter, citing the strong dollar and economic factors.\n\nOn Monday, Apple raised the prices of its Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple One in the United States, for the first time ever. Apple said the increase in Apple Music (Individual from $9.99 to $10.99 per month) subscription price was due to increased licensing costs. The company said artists and songwriters will earn more per stream as a result of the pricing tier changes. Regarding Apple TV+ (Individual from $14.95 to $16.95 per month), the company said the increased price reflects the growing catalog of original TV shows and movies. The price hiking may help services grow somehow (though not for Q4). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vijn6ypgdcw91.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303960e4d7e0d42b711db3a4526d7425c6ec60c5\n\nOverall, market still expects strong earnings from Apple under macro uncertainties. However, after Tesla, Microsoft, Google and Meta's disappointing earnings, if [Apple](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/) fails investors as well, the stock market will surely suffer a further sell-off.",

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",

    "title": "Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s operating earnings jump 20%, conglomerate buys back another $1 billion in stock",
    "selftext": " \n\n* Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.\n* The conglomerate spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion.\n* The Omaha-based company suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the third quarter\u2019s market turmoil, however.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.\n\nThe Omaha-based conglomerate\u2019s operating earnings \u2014 which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities \u2014 totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.\n\nInsurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company\u2019s utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.\n\nBerkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA\u2019s expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire\u2019s equity investments amid the market\u2019s rollercoaster ride.\n\nBerkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is \u201cusually meaningless.\u201d\n\nShares of Buffett\u2019s conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/05/berkshire-hathaway-q3-earnings-brk.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/05/berkshire-hathaway-q3-earnings-brk.html)\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway $BRK.A has reported a 20% jump in operating profits in Q3. Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), and Chevron (CVX) remain Berkshire\u2019s top holdings. Did you have a better Q3 than Warren Buffett?",

    "selftext": "Apple may fall short of its production target for its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models by nearly 6 million units worldwide, Bloomberg reported Monday, after workers at the world's largest iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, China, protested delayed bonus payments, poor living conditions caused by China\u2019s stringent Covid restrictions.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the exact size of the shortfall still remains unclear and will likely depend on manufacturer Foxconn\u2019s ability to hire enough workers for the iPhone assembly line to keep up with production targets.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple had cut its production target for the iPhone 14 by 3 million units due to Covid-related disruptions at the Foxconn plant and that number has now been revised by double, the report adds.\n\nWorkers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201ciPhone city\u201d\u2014have been forced to live on-site in a closed bubble, only being allowed to move from the factory floor to their dorm rooms due to the city\u2019s Covid control measures.\n\nWhile sales of the cheaper iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have slowed down, the pricier iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have continued to remain in strong demand in the U.S., the report adds.\n\nWhile the company has diversified its manufacturing line by making some of its devices in India and Vietnam, nearly all of its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models are made in the Zhengzhou factory.\n\nApple\u2019s shares were down 1.87% in pre-market trading on Monday morning following the report.\n\nFull article: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/11/28/apple-reportedly-faces-shortfall-of-6-million-iphones-amid-china-factory-protests/?sh=b13a99f6814d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/11/28/apple-reportedly-faces-shortfall-of-6-million-iphones-amid-china-factory-protests/?sh=b13a99f6814d)\n\nApple (AAPL) is currently down 1.9% in the premarket after the company reportedly may fall short of its production target for its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models by nearly 6 million units worldwide amid its China factory protests related to its Covid-19 restrictions. How much further do you think AAPL will fall?",

All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE.\n\nAs for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$.\n\nFor those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.\n\n**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  \n**Port % Change:** 1101%\n\n**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  \n**Port % Change**: 102%\n\nWe also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts.\n\nCashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out.\n\nAveraged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March \u201823 swing.\n\nAs we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.\n\nSo overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have\n\n* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C\n* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C\n* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C\n* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C\n* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C\n* TSLA 03/17/2022 220.00 C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5fx1jd2no2a1.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75620710ab55c4de7f9618aaf2eb42487db00452\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 11/28**\n\n10:30 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Nov\n\n**Tuesday 11/29**\n\n9:00 AM S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price YoY Sep10:00 AM CB Consumer Confidence Nov\n\n**Wednesday 11/30**  \n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Nov\n\n8:30 AM GDP Growth Rate QoQ 2nd Est Q3\n\n8:30 AM Goods Trade Balance Adv OCT\n\n8:30 AM Corporate Profits QoQ Prel Q3\n\n9:30 AM Wholesale Inventories MoM Adv OCT\n\n9:30 AM GDP Price Index QoQ 2nd Est Q3\n\n9:30 AM GDP Retail Inventories Ex Autos MoM Adv OCT\n\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI Nov\n\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Oct\n\n10:00 AM Pending Home Sales MoM/YoY Oct\n\n01:30 PM Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Speech - Brookings Institution\n\n**Thursday 12/01**\n\n8:30 AM Personal Spending MoM OCT\n\n8:30 AM Personal Income MoM OCT\n\n8:30 AM PCE Price Index MoM/YoY OCT\n\n8:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims 26th Nov\n\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global Manafaurting PMI Final Nov\n\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Nov\n\n**Friday 12/02**\n\n8:30 AM Non-Farm Payrolls NOV\n\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate NOV\n\nMan last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.\n\n**GDP Q3**\n\nSo we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.\n\nThis month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.\n\nWith USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts\n\n**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**JPow Speech**\n\nJPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.\n\nA lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.\n\nI think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.\n\n**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**PCE**\n\nNow we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.\n\n**JPow play:  SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Wed 30 Nov\n\n**After Close - Snowflake ($SNOW)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.042 &amp; Revenue $539.4M\n* Options pricing in a 15.7% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is very mixed on this, can't see an edge but a big implied move so taking a straddle here\n\n**After Close - Salesforce ($CRM)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.2 &amp; Revenue $7.8B\n* Options pricing in a 9.9% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bullish, but not a very high confidence play either, playing it safe straddling this one too\n\n# Wed 1 Dec\n\n**After Close - Marvell ($MRVL)**\n\n* Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.58 &amp; Revenue $1.5B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish and so am i, every semi company ran of earnings, taking 12/09 45c\n\n**After Close - Dollar General ($DG)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $2.53 &amp; Revenue $9.4B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish,DLTR did beat earnings but missed guidance. I think we get more of the same, Taking 12/09 255p\n\nOther notable earnings this week: $KR $TD.DO $BMO\n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- NFLX Long**\n\nI'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vaafsrxmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dcc6795c04099a286f3027b76883bc088928996\n\n**- AAPL Long**\n\nHas been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvy6evpymo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496a4a6a6a31afe0aae0c1fc2d20e095c13e4709\n\n**- TSLA Long**  \nWe got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mstw3cizmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c6cc55ed54d5d42911f8bf050743b74e73df37\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nMy 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.\n\nI\u2019ll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.\n\nIf my assumptions are correct with this week\u2019s events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i\u2019ll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr65x390no2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=416cb8e5a7401db4cc374a26d62efc4024460e4d\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

But each to his own, we made our $$$. \n\nFor those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.\n\n**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  \n**Port % Change:** 1101%\n\n**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  \n**Port % Change**: 102%\n\nWe also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts. \n\nCashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out. \n\nAveraged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March \u201823 swing.  \n\nAs we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.\n\nSo overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have   \n\n\n* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C\n* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C\n* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C\n* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C\n* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C\n* TSLA 03/17/2022 220.00 C  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6uxkb2cdo2a1.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd77448e4141cbd01072dc679d362107af4235cf\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 11/28**\n\n10:30 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Nov\n\n**Tuesday 11/29**\n\n9:00 AM S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price YoY Sep  \n10:00 AM CB Consumer Confidence Nov\n\n**Wednesday 11/30**  \n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Nov\n\n8:30 AM GDP Growth Rate QoQ 2nd Est Q3\n\n8:30 AM Goods Trade Balance Adv OCT\n\n8:30 AM Corporate Profits QoQ Prel Q3\n\n9:30 AM Wholesale Inventories MoM Adv OCT\n\n9:30 AM GDP Price Index QoQ 2nd Est Q3\n\n9:30 AM GDP Retail Inventories Ex Autos MoM Adv OCT\n\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI Nov\n\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Oct\n\n10:00 AM Pending Home Sales MoM/YoY Oct\n\n01:30 PM Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Speech - Brookings Institution   \n\n\n**Thursday 12/01**\n\n8:30 AM Personal Spending MoM OCT\n\n8:30 AM Personal Income MoM OCT\n\n8:30 AM PCE Price Index MoM/YoY OCT\n\n8:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims 26th Nov\n\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global Manafaurting PMI Final Nov\n\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Nov\n\n**Friday 12/02**\n\n8:30 AM Non-Farm Payrolls NOV\n\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate NOV\n\nMan last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.\n\n**GDP Q3**\n\nSo we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter. \n\nThis month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession. \n\nWith USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts\n\n**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**JPow Speech** \n\nJPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows. \n\nA lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.\n\nI think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient. \n\n**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**PCE**\n\nNow we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.\n\n**JPow play:  SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Wed 30 Nov\n\n**After Close - Snowflake ($SNOW)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.042 &amp; Revenue $539.4M\n* Options pricing in a 15.7% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is very mixed on this, can't see an edge but a big implied move so taking a straddle here\n\n**After Close - Salesforce ($CRM)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.2 &amp; Revenue $7.8B\n* Options pricing in a 9.9% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bullish, but not a very high confidence play either, playing it safe straddling this one too\n\n# Wed 1 Dec\n\n**After Close - Marvell ($MRVL)**\n\n* Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.58 &amp; Revenue $1.5B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish and so am i, every semi company ran of earnings, taking 12/09 45c\n\n**After Close - Dollar General ($DG)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $2.53 &amp; Revenue $9.4B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish,DLTR did beat earnings but missed guidance.

From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/508387qedo2a1.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69f0585e75d52cc5b13a0020ada7767323b0e200\n\n**- AAPL Long**\n\nHas been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8bdxmjfdo2a1.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdbca7d86fa9d7e83544f9adc6f58befa75dc469\n\n**- TSLA Long**  \nWe got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uoelv9fgdo2a1.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79033829ff825a24094f2f51bf5e3ed238c1ac18\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nMy 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move. \n\nI\u2019ll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.\n\nIf my assumptions are correct with this week\u2019s events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i\u2019ll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0v6oi9qdo2a1.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ea11e338afeeca814be632599b56056797c97ec\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m going to start with the overall weirdness of the market this week. I\u2019ve been trading for 5 days and have never seen such odd price movement. Very low volume, fairly significant swings based off literally only AAPL. Now I\u2019m only 12, but I know the signs of waning liquidity when I see it. However, there was a single stock that stood out from the the rest: $GEO\n\nNow let me clarify that private prisons are the epitome of evil, and I do not give a damn that Mitchell Blueberry bought it. The analysis I did over the course of 10 minutes told me one thing: This play cannot go tits up. \n\nIt\u2019s fairly simple. GEO has a dickton of Short Interest. SI almost double M/M from 17.34% to 33.05%. More importantly, the Short Ratio sits at 9.99. For those of us regards, that means it will take 10 trading days for shirts to cover. \n\nNow in a vacuum, this could be seen as just a shitty stock that the feds are shorting. However, today Wedbush upgraded GEO from neutral to outperform &amp; raised their PT from $10 to $14. The stock proceeded to piss missile from +16.23% from $10.23 to $11.89. \n\nI watched it throughout the day, expecting an eventual mean reversion. From 11am to 12pm, it fell from $11.64 to $11.28, and I figured it was done. But no. It recovered. When it cleared $11.50 and kept running, I knew it was game on. After all, the shorts have at minimum 9 more days to cover. \n\nPosition: 50 Dec 16 $13c &amp; 50 Jan 20 $14c. \n\nTl;dr: GEO massively shorted, shorts can\u2019t cover quickly enough, 80% a of shares are owned by institutions, and those chodes are going to rush to cover. It\u2019s math. \n\nHeading to A Day To Remember so I\u2019m writing this in the Uber. Can\u2019t go tits up.",

Musk also argued that the company of freezing its advertising on Twitter and wondering aloud if the alleged pause was because \u201cthey hate free speech in America.\u201d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8senocp534a1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79e7bacd381461b23d1e9dff1db86eddaf331ba5\n\n**However, Mr. Musk seemed to pick up the 'wrong fight' with Apple.**\n\nAnalysts claimed that Twitter\u2019s \u201ca massive drop in revenue\u201d may be a reason for Musk\u2019s fight with apple. Following Mr. Musk\u2019s takeover, General Mills, United Airlines, Pfizer, and General Motors paused ad spending, which is the vast majority of the site\u2019s revenue.\n\nMusk\u2019s plan to shore up the hemorrhaging revenue dam so far is a subscription service, $8 per month for a Blue Tick, not goes well\". And if Musk\u2019s plan worked, Apple would make hundreds of millions of dollars from it. Losing Twitter will not be a very big blow for Apple, but it certainly does to Twitter.\n\nIt's important to emphasize here that Musk isn't alone in criticizing the 30% commission. Apple has faced challenges to its App Store fees and policies from companies such as Spotify, Epic Games, and Meta. But Apple says it's necessary to pay for the staff to keep the company's app review process in place.\n\nAnd as for Apple feezed its advertising on Twitter, according to data from Pathmatics, a digital ad analytics company, Apple spent $84,615 on Twitter ads that very same day. The day before that, Apple spent a full $104,867.\n\nSo after a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Musk tweeted that he has \u201cresolved\u201d a misunderstanding with Apple over his claim that Twitter was being threatened with removal from the iPhone maker\u2019s app store. He also posted a short clip of a pond which he said was at Apple\u2019s HQ, thanking Tim Cook for \u201ctaking me around\u201d.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncapi059634a1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7e7d9d7e5cf4a5863af29752713a12426352469\n\nAlthough the conflict appears to be resolved, for now, Musk's tweets sparked damaging new criticism of Apple from antitrust regulators and app developers who object to the company's policies and the \"gatekeeper\" role it plays in determining what content is permitted on more than 1 billion phones worldwide.\n\nAt the New York Times Dealbook Summit on Wednesday, the CEO of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, blasted the iPhone manufacturer for its App Store restrictions, which have been hurting Meta's company for years. \u201cI do think Apple has singled themselves out as the only company trying to control unilaterally what apps get on the device,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a sustainable or good place to be.\u201d\n\nTim Sweeney, the CEO of \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games, tweeted on Wednesday that fighting Apple's \"monopoly\" was \"an American issue transcending party politics\u201d. On Wednesday Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, and Tim Sweeney, the CEO of \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games, steadfast opponents of Apple's App Store restrictions, joined the chorus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gnbl4qc634a1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fc65e369dafe7f71fc17a2d48b1f044811c05e",

    "selftext": "I was thinking about allocating $15k into AAPL and sell options for cash flow. More specifically, selling ATM or close to ATM puts until getting exercised, then switching to OTM calls until price rises enough to sell ATM with a profit if exercised. \n\nBut can I be more efficient with my capital? Since I want to focus on cash flow, here\u2019s my new thought. Instead of selling 1 put or immediately purchasing 100 shares, I could purchase 2-3 very very deep ITM call LEAPs with the same capital and begin selling calls at the break even strike. This way I would be making 2-3x cash flow from the same capital once prices rise enough to sell ATM calls above breakeven. Is this a decent strategy that anyone utilizes or too risky if prices plummet too far below the breakeven strike? \n\nOnly slightly interested in your thoughts on AAPL specifically- much more interested in thoughts on options strategy.",

    "selftext": "Hello Peeps,\n\nWe all know that the geo political situation with China is not good and could possibly get worse. \n\nSo far China has:\n\n1. Used industrial espionage with impunity to steal Western technology\n2. Supported Russia and Putin by purchasing their Oil\n3. Consistently increased survielance on its citizens and imposed a punitive \"re-education\" program on its minorities\n4. Threatened to invade Taiwan numerous times\n5. Imprisoned Western nationals for no other reason than being Western\n6. Used punitive lock downs on its citizens vis-a-vis Covid\n\nBecause of the above reasons and many more, there is no doubt that Western companies want to move their manufacturing out of Ghyna double time. This has been ongoing but under Pooh Bear's leadership has sped up. One example comes to mind, AAPL now manufacturing in India and Vietnam.\n\nI think there is an opportunity to take advantage of this shift. \n\nI've been looking at a Vietnam ETF VNM and a Korean ETF EWY. Both have performed well recently and I believe this is evidence of all that money relocating to \"safer\" areas. They are both still down for the year however so lots of upside.\n\nAnyways, what are your thoughts on this? \n\nDo you have any other tickers you think would be a good play? \n\nOr do you think relations with Ghyna will get better?",

The SMA20 also turned flat for QQQ on the daily chart.\n\n.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield fell 3.012% to 3.591%, compared with a yield spread of -76 basis points over the two-year note while VIX rose 4.2%. Brent crude closed up 0.17%. Spot gold closed up 0.46% at $1,797.34 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.13%, closing at 105.94.\n\n.\n\nThe latest PPI data released by The U.S. Department of Labor on Friday showed an annual rate of 7.4%, a slightly higher-than-expected increase of 7.2%. It also raised the value for October, just before the Fed's interest rate decision, which is in the midst of the fastest rate hike cycle since the 1980s. Based on last week's ISM report, the price index of goods purchased by factories fell to a two-and-a-half-year low in November, but the shift in consumption to the service sector means that overall inflation will remain high for some time.\n\n**Trending Stocks**\n\n[**Apple (AAPL)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/)\n\nApple dropped 0.34% while Credit Suisse lowered its production projection. Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross said in a research report that according to a survey, Apple's iPhone sales in Q1 2023 may drop by 7 million units due to production problems. However, the analyst noted that the backlog of sales will be transferred to the second quarter. Credit Suisse said it lowered itsQ1 2023 iPhone sales forecast by 7 million to 69 million units, left its forecast for revenue of $121.66 billion unchanged, and lowered its profit forecast by 8% to $1.92 per share from $2.09.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v7024qyvg5a1.png?width=531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d988ad724a6c7f1d94eacce458d0d20d94e5ff5\n\nFor AAPL whoever longed on the setup we called out should all get the 1 to 1 kick on last Friday. The intraday high broke the upside of equilibrium area by 10 cents then dropped right back on the daily chart.\n\n.\n\n[**TR Energy (TRP)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-TRP/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj94ljkzvg5a1.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9013d13df71210f5f1206486d58ee2c3ae26202\n\nTRP stock dropped 0.84% on the news that TC Energy plans to restore the Keystone oil pipeline starting December 10. The company declared force majeure on the pipeline on Thursday after a 14,000 barrel oil spill forced the pipeline to close. The company told the carrier that it expected to restart the pipeline to Patoka, Illinois on Saturday, December 10, and the section to Cushing, Oklahoma, on December 20.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nFor people who are looking for opportunities in reversal patterns, feel free to check out these [Short-Term Reversal Stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/short-term-reversal-stocks/).

The 10-year US Treasury yield rose 2.751% to 3.586%, compared with a yield spread of -68 bps over the two-year note while VIX was down 0.88%. Brent crude closed down 1.24%. Spot gold closed down 0.3% at $1,796.8 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.16%, closing at 104.67.\n\n.\n\n**Trending Stocks**\n\n**Apple (**[**AAPL**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AAPL/)**)**\n\nApple stock is down 1.59%. Apple is planning to release new 14 - and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips in early 2023, according to a report by well-known Apple source Mark Gurman on Monday. The laptops were originally expected to launch this year but have faced internal delays. In addition, Apple has canceled the new Mac Pro with the top \"M2 Extreme\" chip. Mark Gurman claims that based on Apple's current pricing structure, an M2 Extreme Mac Pro would probably cost at least $10,000 (not including any other upgrades), making it a very niche product, It may not be worth the development costs and production resources.\n\n.\n\n**New Oriental (**[**EDU**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EDU/)**)**\n\nEDU shares rose 7.91% after the Chinese Government issued the Outline of the Strategic Plan for Expanding Domestic Demand (2022-2035), which calls for improving the quality of education services. They will encourage nongovernmental sectors to provide diversified educational services, support and standardize the development of privately-run education, comprehensively regulate off-campus education and training, steadily advance the reform of classified management of privately-run education, and carry out high-level Chinese-foreign cooperation in running schools. At the same time, we will strengthen and improve online learning services and promote the co-construction and sharing of all kinds of digital education resources.\n\n.\n\n**Opportunities**\n\nFor people who are looking for opportunities in reversal patterns, feel free to check out these [Short-Term Reversal Stocks](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/short-term-reversal-stocks/).

The market generally believes that this marks a positive outcome of China-Us audit supervision cooperation and sends a positive signal for Chinese companies to list in the US.

If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)\u00b7 The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

    "title": "$V VS $MA VS $AAPL.... are $V and $MA in danger?",
    "selftext": "$V and $MA both are global payment processing companies that operate networks of electronic payment systems and issue credit and debit cards. $V is the larger of the two companies and has a larger global presence. They both generate revenue by charging fees to merchants and financial institutions for the use of their payment processing network. They enable the electronic transfer of funds between banks and other financial institutions.\n\n$AAPL has moved in recent years into the payment service. With Apple wallet, a digital wallet that allows you to store and manage your loyalty cards, boarding passes, movie tickets, coupons, and other types of passes in one place, and with Apple Pay, which allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web, with connecting. These services have been embraced by many customers.\n\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, the adoption of mobile payments like Apple Pay has been steadily increasing in the US, with an estimated of 34% of smartphone users making a mobile payment in 2021. Additionally, in a recent survey said that 73% of respondents said contactless payments were a more convenient form of payment. The only disadvantage is that not all consumers, particularly older ones, don\u2019t feel comfortable with the technology.\n\nSo with a large costume base and user exposure, if $AAPL decides to one day create its own credit card will $V and $MA go bankrupt?\n\nLet\u2019s look at some financials:\n\n* $V total revenue $29.310B, Net income $14.957B, and Free Cash Flow of $17.879B. $MA total revenue $18.884B, Net income $8.687B, and Free Cash Flow of $8.649B.\n* $V revenue has grown in the last year by 21%, and $MA revenue has grown in the last year by 23%.\n* $V has a ROE of 0.420% and $MA has a ROE of 1.538%.\n* $V ROIC is 24.23% and $MA ROIC is 43.32%\n\n**I am currently holding $V should I sell?**",
