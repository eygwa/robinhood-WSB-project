    "selftext": "More importantly, the user pointed to the fact that Tesla Inc.'s \n\nTSLA\n-1.27%\n+ Free Alerts\nvehicle deliveries increased from 22,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 180,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the same timeframe, the stock soared from $50 to $800.\n\nThe Redditor said Nio can go from the current pace of deliveries of 20,000 to 150,000 in the third quarter of 2022, as its second factory comes online. This would mean Nio stock could hit the $400 milestone in 18 months, said the Redditor, adding that Nio is bolstered in its quest for supremacy by governmental support, the booming EV market opportunity in China, premium pricing of its vehicles, higher gross margins, limited competition in the high-end EV. \n\nNio hit close to 92k deliveries for the year. Nio is gonna hit 400 it\u2019s inevitable. People should see how great this stock truly is.",

    "selftext": "Rivian (RIVN) is a corporation damned to bankruptcy because it missed the boat on the electric vehicle adoption curve. This is because in the normal 2023 and early 2024 model years most traditional automakers will: have figured out how to make EV\u2019s, and more importantly produce them at scale.\n\nThe bull case for disruptive tech companies in general is that they can build market share and profit margins based on that market share and product lock in. The problem is that the global auto industry is figuring out battery electric vehicles. This means that the future profit streams are going to be subject to the meat grinder called the global auto industry (one of the most competitive industries on earth)!\n\nIf battery electric vehicles are not successful due to the fundamental constraints of the technology, traditional auto makers have the legacy products continuing to make money and can sell electric vehicles as a niche product to improve cafe ratings!\n\nBut even more importantly; Rivian unlike Tesla (TSLA) does not have the time to develop their production capabilities, without normal automakers catching up on battery electric vehicle technology! So even if battery electric vehicles are the future: the fact is, that Rivian does not have the physical capital and know how to produce vehicles at scale. Tesla was inches away from bankruptcy, when Tesla was figuring out how to produce the Model 3! How much more so will Rivian be, when other auto manufacturers release their competing battery electric vehicles, (for example Honda\u2019s (HMC) release of the Honda Prologue, which is most likely to be about the size of the Honda Pilot, or Acura MDX; or more importantly the Rivian R1S! And of course, Honda can produce a Ridgeline version of the Prologue to compete against the R1T.)\n\nUnfortunately, Rivian has missed the boat. Have fun watching the stock return to her actual value! Or you can heed my warning and sell now for a great profit.\n\nThis is her form 10-Q. Looks like a company worthy of being the 3rd largest automaker!\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001874178-21-000006/rivn-20210930.htm](https://sec.report/Document/0001874178-21-000006/rivn-20210930.htm)",

    "selftext": "By now we should all be experts at realizing how powerful the fed is. Especially proven by the declines today (which will continue, slowly).\n\nAnd with Inflation flying, job growth is booming, GDP for the most part hitting its targets, and JPOW looking like he has aged 40 years.\n\nWe can assume that jpow is officially and finally losing access to his money printer. (bears are in control).\n\nThese should all be things you guys understand, no real big brain shit.\n\nHowever, How to make money off this is what separates the Retards from the Autists.\n\nI by no means have a crystal ball, but I would like to point out a few things that everyone should be thinking about when it comes to trying to make money in in 2022.\n\n1. Companies that live off of cheap debt are going to be crushed, examples: Doordash, and real estate companies - Zillow, and Blackstone.\n2. Banks are being handed a gift here, higher interest rates means banks can charge more in closing fees. Long WFC, BAC, MTB (they'll become more profitable, Revenues may reduce)\n3. Interest rates are rising, Which really means bond prices are falling. TYO, TTT and other short US treasury Etfs will absolutely kill it.\n4. Although all stocks will likely take hits, Companies like MSFT, T, FB and other monsters that have taken out cheap loans in 2021 to repurchase stock in 2022 will likely fare better than the rest. (TSLA, NFLX are not a monster in this way.)\n5. Its also my opinion that 2022 will be the year the fundamentals start to actually matter again as money becomes more scarce. TXRH is a $72 stock max.\n\nI'm only trying to help, pls dont rip me. I do \"work\" in finance (not financial advice, do your own DD).",

    "selftext": " \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znd7bx210z981.png?width=251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdde29303e3fc325f2edce0f447b96cec31ae6d6\n\nMy gains.  \n\nAssociate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. Let\u2019s not squander this opportunity.\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a drop in the price. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the stock price, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate price recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**\n2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \\*clinical\\* data.**\n3. &amp;#x200B;\n\n**Math Class:**\n\nStock price\u2019s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations\n\nThirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.\n\n**Complete recovery means the price will Increase 432%, not 66%.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**\n\nFor this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer\u2019s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA\u2019s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. \n\nWhy did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: \n\n***\"If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.\"*** \n\nPut simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data\u2019s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that\u2019s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  \n\nBut before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam\u2019s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm\u2019s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab\u2019s results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mui1zs60z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02dc23fb4794b0d2b41878ffeb3ff7f01f21f4be\n\n**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** \n\nOn August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen\u2019s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety; however, the report 70-page report and five supplements mentioned no significant adverse events. Here is the full [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) for your viewing pleasure. You might assume the price action signified the|accusations had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won\u2019t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:\n\n1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. \n\n2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. \n\n3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. \n\n4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses? The summary of the number of doses can be found [here](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam), and again here is the [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) filed by Pitt and Bredit.\n\n5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.\n\nI am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can\u2019t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this \u2018news.\u2019 The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the price recovers leading up to the citizen\u2019s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I\u2019m probably not ;)).\n\n**Need More Evidence?**\n\nBelow is a tweet essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a84qpth90z981.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1f1c56cd14553c388e56edd2567abcb10785a9d\n\nYou will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under no circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3.\n\n**Still More Evidence:**\n\nOn November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, \"there are no signs of data manipulation.\" SAVA price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. \n\n**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**\n\nSAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.\n\n[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu4s6wkg0z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196ed053083cae9e70a8e9bd583f78b84c9a24cf\n\nReady?  Okay, the data readout was \u201cprimary endpoints were not met\u201d meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. \n\nNow let\u2019s look at SAVA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxisqrui0z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2ee063b74d1266c778ff3760281d3f574e266cf\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)\n\nSAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, \u201cInsiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.\u201d** \n\nTo reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won\u2019t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.\n\n**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**\n\nThere will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). \n\nSAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  \n\nOther potential drivers of price action include:\n\n* A SI of 40%. (ATH\u2019s)\n* A float of less than 40 million.\n* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)\n\nAll this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.  \n\n**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**\n\n[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)\n\nWhy did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam\u2019s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: \u201c[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).\u201d\n\n**Simufilam's data shows it is:** \n\n**1). Safe**\n\n**2) Effective** \n\n**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**\n\nIt was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. These clinical sites can be audited by the IRB at any time. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded) which can be audited by the FDA at any time. CRA\u2019s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way\u2026\n\nLong-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It\u2019s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.\n\nI must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.  \n\n***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** \n\nSAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I\u2019ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.\n\n**House cleaning:**\n\nI spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, \"A Comprehensive Stock Analysis\"](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). \n\nThe Authors include\n\nClinical and Academic Neurologists, \n\nMDs, \n\nPhDs, \n\nPharmDs, \n\nSuccessful biotech investors \n\nAn Chief Global Strategist and Healthcare Leader\n\nThrough my investing career, IMO, the first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data they examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market's \"headline hysteria\" usually means buying opportunities for them (\u201coverreaction with reversion to the mean\u201d).\n\nSAVA's YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  \n\nIf you have dyslexia and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA's medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).\n\n**Did I mention SAVA\u2019s historical data and Alzheimer\u2019s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** \n\nWith the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  \n\n**Lastly:**\n\n**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  \n\nAnyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.  \n\nAll the above represent my own opinions. This is not financial or medical advice. I have been wrong many times, so do your own DD. Good luck!!!",

Looking at these deep OTM contracts I anticipate a hard tech rally next week. This ladder attack has been going on long enough and shorts probably want to stop paying fees if there is no dip on SPY below $450/TSLA below $899.\n2. Tesla earnings are on 1/26, so I expect an earnings run-up breaking ATH and a continued rally, given their bullish delivery numbers the other week.\n3. Shorts will also cover (creating a fat bull run for TSLA) since stocks go up, not flat for 3+ months.\n4. Cramer ignores TSLA Friday in his article \u201c**Jim Cramer says these 5 \u2018old tech\u2019 stocks could have a big year in 2022.\u201d** Always inverse Cramer for Tech.

Elon sold before TSLA dipped to around $1,020 Friday. I expect Elon to rebuy this upcoming week given the earnings run-up and the deep OTM TSLA weekly 1/14 calls. Like who tf drops that much money in deep OTM TSLA weeklies?

    "title": "My view on $WISH",
    "selftext": "First of all it's not a financial advice so please do your own DD before investing on anything and only invest the amount you are fully prepared to loose! Also if you are a conservative investor, Index fund is far far better and if you are a value investor, there are ton of opportunities out there and always will be. This is a growth bet !\n\nI am long WISH and I might be little biased; however I am in it to make money so I heartily welcome all LONG BEAR points; not short. Short terms are mostly driven by events and not business fundamentals so WISH could go to $2 if people do not like the new CEO for example ! There is no limit how much low a stock can go unfortunately; please go read Peter Lynch. If you are trying to time the market, good luck!! Also if you are a day trader, good luck to you as well !! - I recently read a post from fellow investor who turned over $28 million in a year and was in negative $7600 :) I personally think it's not worth the time and emotional well being.\n\nWhat I have learned during my 5 years investing journey is that stocks mostly move up and down driven by sentiment; it comes down to demand and supply - if people are willing to sell for less OR if there are less buyers than sellers, price moves down. These are mostly driven by \\`catalysts\\` - a positive/negative earnings, black/white swan events, macro events or even a PR ! But these moves do not usually last long so unless you are trying to time the market, its very difficult to win most of the time.\n\nI would mostly like to focus on two things on this DD - why WISH is down? and if it can recover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why WISH is down so much?**\n\n**Sector rotation:**\n\n* The short answer is sector rotation - BIG money going elsewhere. It's just not WISH, the whole growth small cap sector is down big time. And there are some add-ons to it - SPAC/new IPOs are further down, e-commerce sector is further down, growth are hammered, companies having China ties are further down. Just look at  one year chart of these companies for example - STNE (Warren buffet is an investor), BABA (Charlie Munger), CLOV/OPEN (Chamath); TDOC, CRSP (Cathie Wood) even PayPal and SQ are down big time. Remember February last year? It doesn't take much time to move them back up if BIG money flows back in :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Macro events:**\n\n* Chinese govt crackdown on tech companies- BABA, DIDI,BAIDU and whole Chinese tech. This negatively effected WISH as well.\n* Reopening of economy drove consumers to stores and it made the 2nd quarter look bad. All e-commerce revenue is down including ETSY and AMZN not just WISH.\n* Apple changed privacy policy and it had huge impact on Ad spending (it impacted many growth companies who relied on Ad spending to procure customers) - price went up 2-3 times.\n* Supply chain issues - specifically goods coming out of China.\n* Inflation and rising interest fear in the market though it shouldn't effect WISH as it has no debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other WISH specific catalysts:**\n\n* CFO's departure\n* BIG investors exit\n* Slow down (pause) of growth and MAUs down\n* CEO's leaving\n* Down trend causing price to go further down - sentiment, margin call, tax harvesting and few others.\n* Meme tag\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And finally some noise:**\n\n* Negative short articles all over (by shorts)\n* Lawsuits (mostly fake)\n* High short selling (by short term traders)\n* Insiders selling (no real selling - almost all of them are for tax purpose to cover RSU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, can WISH recover?**\n\nAbsolutely ! Go look at NIO, ETSY, TSLA, AMD and even AMZN - you can find many. It may take some time since there are ton of attractive companies to invest in right now - let's just take BABA for example; I believe it should be trading at 3x today. But I am staying put at WISH because I believe BABA can't 10x and WISH has that potential. Here's why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Has been built over a period of decade and over $2 billion has been invested in the business (including advertisings) before IPO money. Go look at CrunchBase - there were many rounds of investing and many investors invested over $5b valuation level before 2015. As everybody knows WISH was offered by AMZN and BABA $10 billion in 2015.\n* 500 million plus downloads in Google play store with about 14 millions over 4 star reviews! Over 2.4 million positive reviews on Apple Store, top 5 e-commerce global platform in many countries - Can you believe it? $1 billion enterprise value with $1.2 billion hard cash? Compare that to Aliexpress and other e-commerce platform.\n* Came from IPO and not SPAC route. When companies go for IPO, due diligence/valuation is little strict compared to SPAC deals as the Banks have to underwrite. It was valued at $24 a share. At the time JPMC and few others have $30 PT for 2021. Business has actually improved a lot since then if we forget growth for a min which is proportionate to Ad spending.\n* Is a global e-commerce platform and not US only like ETSY, Wayfair, Overstock etc.. It's not cheap to build a global e-commerce platform so there is a significant barrier of entry.\n* Has its own business segment that no US/Western company has - serving low to middle class value seeking customer base. Since it is global, it has huge potential to penetrate into India, Brazil and African markets as well. Look at Flipcart (India), MercadoLibre (brazil), Jumia (africa) - WISH do not need to win anywhere, just a small slice of cake is more than enough to increase revenue significantly!\n* Has now built its own logistics business - $1 billion revenue is not a joke! Imagine small merchants being able to ship worldwide effortlessly! Most of the third world countries have copyright issues/fake product issues - they are willing to spend higher if they can buy authentic Nike shoes for example.\n* Has $1.2 billion in cash and no debt. Over the period of last 6 months I have investigated many companies and I haven't seen any companies in WISH's size to have that much money with no debt  AND this level of Revenue ! Inflation and rising interest rates are no problem for WISH. I've read people's concerned about cash burn, but that's going to be stabilized starting this quarter. $1 billion is a lot of money to spend for growth! It can even buy small companies to diversify its business, invest in new technology and even buy it's own share (its highly unlikely for growth companies though). WISH actually has already been working on WISH clips, live shopping and new influencer led businesses. I believe 1Sansome has potential to be a billion dollar business in no time ! Go look at SHEIN -I encourage people to compare SHEIN and 1Sansome website. SHEIN is now a $10 billion dollar business. \n* Social commerce that WISH is heading into is already more than a $1T business. - [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/social-commerce-the-next-wave-in-online-shopping/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/social-commerce-the-next-wave-in-online-shopping/)\n* Is promptly acting to align/fix it's business - revamping it's website, introducing video clips/live shopping, fixing merchant/product quality issues, improving shipping time and potentially getting into new business segments - fintech, payment processing, trend shopping etc.\n* Got the best management in place now. Forget Peter - he was an engineer and not a business person. Google was actually run by Eric Schdmit and was brought in by the founders Surgery and Larry. I recognize the charm about founder led companies but he still does own about 20% of the business so he is vested. In fact, he is the one who brought Jackie in. Peter has become millionaire from billionaire so he has the most vested interest in WISH than any of us! and I encourage people to go read Jackie's employment terms - her major compensation starts when the WISH stock reaches $30! Also most of the higher management is paid in RSU so its in their interest to make the company successful and remain with WISH.\n* Has the most cost efficient business model - It doesn't need investment in physical warehouse -WISH Local is now just paused but it has huge potential. It's employee efficiency is highest in the industry - just about 1,000 people running the company VS SHEIN with 10,000 employees !\n* Rising Ad costs are effecting every e-commerce growth companies but WISH's Ad campaign is the most efficient of most of them. In fact Facebook offered $20 million for its Ad algorithm very early on. I've read many posts that WISH Ad campaign is one of the most efficient campaign in Facebook so it would fare better and can remain competitive. They got the best Data science team - look at their patents! It's a data science / AI company as well.\n* Even though WISH's revenue is decreased and MAU's have decreased, it's still very significant - go compare with ETSY. This quarter is important - if it can become close to EBTDA positive with less Ad spending and still manages to maintain 40M active users and about 1.5B revenue, it's already a lot ! I do not see any issues doubling the revenue if WISH can make those customers happy and increase their LTV - 40 millions of \\`active\\` customers are a lot of customers.\n* Major competitor is Aliexpress but go try buying something from there and try to return an item or settle an issue! You have to deal with the seller first. WISH no question asked - you even keep your item. Also WISH is growing its merchant base all the world - about 50% are now US based.\n* E-commerce segment is growing fast and would pass $8 trillion by 2025. With fast delivery and last mile delivery solved, traditional competitors like dollar general, five below and even Macy's JCPenny and most will be wiped out or wouldn't be able to compete. WISH should benefit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Common perceptions:**\n\n* Selling Chinese products =&gt; It's not even a point - more than 90% products sold all over the world are from China and it's for a reason - its most cheaper to manufacture products there. Most items Amazon sells are made in China. But the point is WISH is trying to create/promote Chinese brands - Assume a Chinese shoes brand that compares with Nike but half the cost.\n* Selling dildos =&gt; Sex toys are billions of dollar business. I don't see negatives there.\n* Selling cheap products -=&gt;it's the main business ! Dollar General has $50 billion market cap alone and there are others - dollar tree, five below and even Japanese Daiso.\n* Selling fraudulent products =&gt; It's not WISH selling them, its the sellers. Could you not post anything on facebook marketplace? I am not saying it's not an issue and I think WISH is working hard to discourage/minimize those sellings.\n* Float too high for short squeeze =&gt; Look at Nokia; it went up 80% in one day last year - it has 10 times the float of WISH.\n* Cash burn =&gt; I would like to point out that companies are not usually upfront about investments. For example google categories them under \\`New bets\\`. So investment in 1Sansome for example might be hidden under SG&amp;A ! We do not know what else is out there investment/initiative wise.\n* France ban =&gt; I take that as positive and it will be solved soon. WISH was already working on to fix quality/merchant issues - [https://merchant.wish.com/documentation/api/v3/reference#tag/EU-Product-Compliance](https://merchant.wish.com/documentation/api/v3/reference#tag/EU-Product-Compliance)\n* Going to zero =&gt; It may go down further but not going to zero. Only companies with debt are in immediate risk of going bankrupt. $1 billion is more than enough to create few startups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here are few upcoming catalysts:**\n\n* New CEO =&gt; Whoever is brought in, his fortune will be tied to WISH. Also whoever it is, it would be far better than Peter business wise.\n* Fourth Qtr earnings =&gt; Cash burn should stabilize and it should be close to EBTDA positive, if not a surprise profit !\n* Website revamp =&gt; Hopefully it will fix many issues including having to login ! I also think just a minor fix such as sorting a search results by price, reviews, sales and other metric should drive sales. Right now, I can't sort by specific products that are highest sellers in the category ! Its so dumb :)\n* Video shopping/Live Streaming =&gt; This is now big in China - look at Pinduoduo and others. Social commerce is the next BIG thing - a next gen QVC.\n* Potential buyout =&gt; I am personally not interested in buyout but its a possibility if it goes further down.\n* Wish standard, Wish access, revamped website, quality control, Wish clip and efficient use of marketing dollar should help return to growth.\n* Also very excited about 1Sansome - I believe its a underdog.\n* Investors who sold for a loss (tax harvesting) might be returning soon. For example I can't imagine why Jack Morris wouldn't buy back WISH at $3 unless he was not true about his WISH investment before.\n* I have a feeling we will see Institutional investment reaching back above 80% when the SEC filings come out this quarter. Vanguard now is the 2nd highest investor and its average is about $8.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Add-ons:**\n\n\\- If share price doesn't reach at least $17 by March 2023, Jackie gets 0. In order to fully vest her RSU price has to be at least $35. If the buyout occurs, stock price has to be at least $17 in order for her to make any money.

    "selftext": "QuantumScape Is Expanding Beyond Electric Vehicles. It's a Huge Move. -- Barrons.com\nMentioned:\tQS\nAl Root \n\nSolid state battery technology company QuantumScape is moving beyond electric vehicles, looking at applying its rechargeable battery technology into the market for stationary power applications. It opens up a new, potentially huge, market for the company. \n\nQuantumScape (ticker: QS) announced a partnership Thursday with Fluence Energy (FLNC) designed to introduce solid-state lithium-based rechargeable batteries into stationary power applications. \n\nSolid state, in the case of QuantumScape, means the company's batteries don't have a liquid in them facilitating electrical current. Today's lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from cells phones to EVs, have liquid electrolytes. \n\nGoing solid state can improve battery safety and lower costs. That's great news for the EV industry. Batteries still drive the biggest cost difference between electric and traditional gasoline-powered cars. But lower costs and better safety are desirable features for any battery application. \n\nBatteries are being used for backup power generation applications, like in the case of a Tesla (TSLA) Powerwall. Batteries are also being used by utilities to help make renewable power generation available 24-7 by storing wind and solar energy in huge battery packs, like in the case of a Tesla Megapack. \n\nTesla, of course, has a small stationary power business along with its larger EV business. QuantumScape now seems to be pursing a similar path. \n\n\"Fluence and QuantumScape share the same mission to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and adoption of energy storage technologies, so our collaboration is a natural fit,\" said QuantumScape CEO Jagdeep Singh in the company's news release. \"While we have historically focused on automotive applications, we believe our battery technology is broadly applicable and can play a role in other sectors contributing to a lower-carbon future.\" \n\nQuantumScape estimates that stationary power installations will grow to a $385 billion annual market opportunity by the end of the decade, up from less than $20 billion today. Global electric-vehicle sales might amount to $2 trillion by then. The batteries going into those EVs might generate $250 billion in sales for battery makers. Those are all theoretical numbers, but the potential for both markets is large for QuantumScape and other battery makers. \n\nInvestors, however, don't appear to be thinking about 2030 just yet. QuantumScape stock was down about 2.2% in trading Thursday at $20.49. Fluence stock fell about 3.2%. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.3%. \n\nQuantumScape's technology isn't commercial yet. Wall Street expects significant sales to start coming in by mid-decade. Analysts project the company will generate about $181 million in sales by 2026. \n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com \n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires",

Using 33% as conservative EBITDA growth and 56% as aggressive.\n\nQ221 - 2b Annualized 8b = $800 PT \nQ321 - 2.8b Annualized 11.2b=$1120 PT\nConservative\nQ421 - 3.75b Annualized 15b=$1500 PT\nAggressive\nQ421 - 4.37b Annualized 17.47=$1747 PT\n\nExpecting this to rally to between 1500-1747 before next earnings.\n\nIf growth continues at current pace, my estimate is we will be looking at close to $2500 price target by end of 2022. \n\nSo stay excited, as this is modeling the way market is behaving. And that is what really matters. \n\nRemember Amazon has only 10% growth and has multiple of 64.5, so Tesla with annualized 120% should definitely have 100 or higher multiple.",

    "selftext": "Why you should listen to me : Like most of you, I\u2019ve been contemplating the macroeconomic implications of our current interest rate environment. And, hopefully like most of you, I\u2019ve come to realize that I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about\n\nI\u2019ll try to use lots of pictures. We\u2019re currently in the most interest rate negative environment we\u2019ve had in awhile\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qges097d9pb81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32f86d0000a8e8f858d60f4487b7bf5b8dbfbe3a\n\nNegative interest rates are funny, you know when you use forbidden corn and you get paid to take out a loan everyone wants to call it a ponzi, but in traditional finance we just call it rich people collateralizing their assets to take out loans against them to defer tax payments as long as possible (banks then use these collateralized assets to lend to anyone wanting leverage or to borrow for a short, just like in forbidden corn land).\n\nThis has important TINA implications because it means that it continues to make even more sense for rich people to stake their assets as collateral at banks, and it also makes sense for banks to be buying convertible debt whereby they get shares of companies if the share price goes above X price. Banks are forced to basically be buying call options on growth stonks\n\nAnyways when we\u2019re talking about interest rates it\u2019s important to remember that money has a time element attached to it. In general the lower the interest rate, the more valuable money farther out in time is. To calculate this, we use discounted cash flow (I promise this is the only time I\u2019ll utter these words), check out this table\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ly22r4g9pb81.png?width=369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2002493603957f0ec08d25b3b3b9cf50f4e6ce14\n\nEDIT : u/darthboof provided some comments below on how i could improve the table. The \"growth\" value I'm assuming is that in year 5 it gets all of the cash flows, adjusted for inflation, that the value stock did but that growth gets it all in year 5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[EDIT number 2 the last table had miscalc i entered wrong value, if inflation = interest it doesn't matter when u get ur money, if inflation \\&gt; interest then u want ur money as late as possible](https://preview.redd.it/oq7hek4bwqb81.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e395556addf89027937782810ccd04ee3c8576f)\n\nYou can see if real rates are negative (meaning that inflation &gt; risk free rate), then it's better for u to get ur cash farther out in time\n\nFor markets what matters is the rate of change these things are moving in (so like, first derivative) which begs the question\n\nWhy the fuck is everyone selling ARK growth stonks when the rate of change of interest rate environment has been increasingly more and more negative ?\n\nI honestly think people are putting themselves off sides here and that the ARK trade is going to reverse soon as it dawns on people that 1) we\u2019re going to be in a negative real rate environment for awhile 2) that everyone is way way way offsides\n\nHow do we play this ?\n\nWhat follows is generally complete nonsense and probably wrong for a bunch of reasons, but I had to figure out which ARK calls I want to buy so here we go\n\nSo I\u2019ve been selling puts on GME for months fairly profitably, up until maybe the last 2 months when I have been getting completely ran over and forced to take delivery every single time I sell a put on a dip. Anecdotally, I know call sellers who bought into GME at 15 and who have similarly been making money selling calls against shares for months. This dynamic can lead to volatility suppression at some points in the volatility surface which theoretically mean some calls should be good \u201cvalue\u201d.\n\nI imagine some people who hold individual ARK names that are deep in profit are similarly selling calls, or if they are particularly bullish on a single name selling puts etc = vol cheap on the front end, so buy it\n\nHere\u2019s a chart with different tickers, strikes, and IV calculated from ETRADE for 1,2,3,4 week tenors. Note all our brokers calculate IV poorly so this chart is literally crime but tbh I just wanna throw darts so who gives a fuck give it a look and pick ur poison\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pph8pwyx9pb81.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90ab124ce98057b5ad5c931a7618138d75650867\n\nThis chart looks like shit but it\u2019s fitting because it\u2019s a complete crime, anyways to me it looks like the curve is too suppressed on the front end for TSLA and SPOT so that's what I'm buying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22l19jc6apb81.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a8c2a971045170acf2292c4889c2f31b4ef256\n\nMy plan for now is to blow 6k to 9k every week on short dated calls, I will be changing my methodology from this iv suppression shit tho coz this is a pretty bad way to do this but w/e\n\nEDIT : took profits, keeping 1 spot contract running\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tl8yvv6kvpb81.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cb5d1fb4e3415fe79c27a79dd6ad14d933c7ecf\n\nEDIT took profits",

    "selftext": "U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, with the Nasdaq plunging 2.5% and Chinese stocks following with a 6% drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbityugw0mb81.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcf5a77c90933ceaea29c11fa7ac8180a2c7d191\n\n**The big-name TPG went public, but do you dare to buy the stock?**\n\nThe famous private equity firm TPG went public today and closed at a price 15% higher than the IPO price. TPG has been established for 30 years and has a good reputation, but because it is not a public company, the financial situation can only be seen in a fog. Is it better to take advantage of TPG's reputation to charge the stock market, or to slow down and think about one question first - why is a company that has not been listed for 30 years, suddenly listed?\n\nTPG's S1 can be described as extremely complex, 459 pages long (only some time ago Rivian was listed less than 300 pages). Of course, the complexity of S1 proves that the company is willing to disclose, whether you can read it or not is up to your level. You think the purpose of a company going public is just to make money, naive. tpg this round of listing, play is a major transfer of assets.\n\nLet's start with the big picture. According to the company's S1 disclosure, this round of IPO listing, shaving off the old shareholder China Life to sell shares and listing underwriting costs, TPG expected revenue will be $ 820 million (after the green shoe).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcpio18z0mb81.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a39fefb7c9e5422dc65f1c41f0f4a9e87ded388\n\nYou'd think the $820 million would go into the company's books, but no, the $820 million would first have to go to the company's old shareholders (non-China Life shareholders) for $380 million. Normally, a prospectus can clearly show which old shareholders are selling their shares to exit, but this prospectus does not show that at all. It just says that the $380 million will go to the senior shareholders of a company called TPG Operating Group.\n\nThe public offering is of TPG Partners stock, but TPG Partners is a shell company and the real operating company is TPG Operating Group, which is a very powerful move because the shareholders of TPG Operating Group are completely hidden, so it is not known how the $380 million will be distributed to the senior shareholders. The operation of TPG Operating Group was also well hidden through this operation.\n\nThe real problem is the transfer of assets since TPG went public. The prospectus did not hide the fact that this operation was called \"reorganization\", and the chart below shows the structure of the company before and after the \"reorganization\" in the prospectus.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jq56g5c41mb81.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c319044e8e8c4dc39dc76f125dccda0a96ade7ed\n\nThrough this IPO, all institutional/retail shareholders received 11% of the actual company and 1.4% of the voting rights, but this does not reflect the true transfer of assets at all.\n\nAccording to page 126 of the prospectus, in addition to the old shareholders taking $380 million in cash, the old shareholders also divested $1.15 billion of TPG Operating Group's assets through a number of operations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u1scag91mb81.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d2add2414898cfd58f2b58db9622f7bf2533c6\n\nThis includes $0.8 billion in cash and two large investments (one $720 million and one $250 million). The $720 million investment is not a public investment and the $250 million is from TPG Group Holdings (SBS). According to the data of the care book, the cost of this investment in 2019 is $180 million, which means that the two-year return reaches 34%.\n\nI do not know what consideration the old shareholders of TPG have taken to divest this $1.1 billion asset from the assets of the listed company, and of course the prospectus will not explain. But this kind of operation will inevitably make people feel that the company has the suspicion of divesting good assets and listing bad assets. If this were listed on the SSE, 100% would receive an inquiry letter from the SEC.\n\nIt is usually thought that a company listed, at most, is A shares and B shares, two kinds of equity. But TPG's IPO has created 4 types of shares: ordinary A shares, non-voting A shares, B shares and Common Unit, and it is really a master of equity operation.\n\n**Company News**\n\n**TPG Partners (TPG): IPO offer price $29.50, opened at $33, up 15%.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtrggfqa1mb81.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b2fb5fcf189f0704882cc3546bfb06cbe605b8f\n\n**Ford Motor (F): Market cap topped $100 billion for the first time, up 5.7% today and up 2% by the close of trading.** Ford's market cap now exceeds that of General Motors (GM) and Rivian (RIVN), but still lags significantly behind Tesla (TSLA).",

    "title": "Options Mechanics And Principles For Beginners",
    "selftext": "Title says it all. I'll keep this at a Barney-level of elementary so you guys can understand the content.\n\nI'm tired of seeing the \"stock went up but I still lost money. HELP!?!?!\" posts.\n\nComplicated concepts are just made up of smaller concepts.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n**Fundamentals I: The Basics)**\n\nAn option is the right but not the obligation (hence: option) to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock (the *underlying* asset) at a specified price (*strike price*) and expiration date.\n\n**A call is the right to buy 100 shares; a put is the right to sell 100 shares**\n\n**Intrinsic value:** Value of an option at expiration\n\n**Extrinsic value:** Value of an option at current price minus value of option at expiration (additional value derived from time and volatility rather than inherent, intrinsic value)\n\nIf you buy a $300c on $MSFT, and the stock gains $10, you gain $1000 of intrinsic value ($10 x 100) as long as the option is **in the money (ITM)**. ITM means that the option is above the strike price. The advantage is that an ITM option retains its value better, but is more expensive and offers less leverage per dollar, though has the same actual 100x leverage.\n\nIf the stock is BELOW (on the bad side of) the strike price, it is considered **out of the money (OTM)**. This means that the option is inherently worthless. The point of an OTM option is that it is cheaper, offers the same leverage, and has proportionately more leverage per dollar. The disadvantage is that it decays and loses value quickly if the stock goes down. Think *Feast or Famine.* **This is the spirit of WSB.**\n\n**At The Money (ATM)** means that the option is at or very near to the strike price of an option. If you couldn't extrapolate that the advantages/disadvantages of this option are between ITM and OTM, please stop reading and disable options access in your Robinhood account.\n\n**Fundamentals II: The Greeks)**\n\nThere are variables that describe the change in value of an option over time, volatility, and price. These are called \"The Greeks\". You don't have to memorize the exact definition, but you should know what each of them mean.\n\nIn actuality, there are at least 16 Greeks. First-order, second-order, and third-order to describe rate of change of rate of change of (nonsense). You don't have to know that many.\n\nHere are the main ones:\n\n**Delta: Change in option price per $1 change in the underlying stock**\n\n**Gamma: Change in option Delta per $1 change in the underlying stock**\n\n**Theta: Decay of an option price per day of passed time**\n\n**Vega: Change of an option's price per 1% change of implied volatility**\n\n**Rho: You don't need to know what this is. Option price change vs Interest rates. Barely matters. I'm including it because you autists use Robinhood and it's on there.**\n\n*Q: \"Why are these important?\"*\n\n*A: Because you can still lose money when a stock goes the \"right\" direction of your Delta, but Theta and Vega gut your option beyond profit. For example, earnings calls - Volatility drops intensely after the earnings call, and since both puts and calls have positive Vega, you will lose a LOT of value due to Vega.*\n\nTakeaway: Directionality is NOT enough to make profit off of an option. An ATM call or put has, on average, a 33% chance of profit.\n\nAlso, the Greeks are a very good yet imperfect representation of option prices. The Black-Scholes equation has limitations and makes some assumptions, but theoretical finance is beyond the scope of this write-up.\n\n**Fundamentals III: The Elusive Intelligent Play)**\n\nUnderstanding option mechanics is NOT enough to make intelligent moves. Shorting volatility on earnings is statistically positive, yet barely better than guessing even though it's the \"right\" move.\n\nTake, for example, an ATM TSLA call. Do you know what the profit trajectory looks like? It looks like this:\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/0v66erz6lub81.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c836cd1e16c2cfe7d381ebfb8e5cd7c25d028c2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people knew that this is what they were agreeing to when they bought an option, much fewer people would participate. OTM options are even worse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/thgxd8p9lub81.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa4141ceba39668a17bff67b94e7fdbcb117227)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nITM options are weaker, but still unimpressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ITM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/3632951blub81.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4948fe3971b48db878c229d28c3b48e7c590b04e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals IV: Turning a Profit)**\n\nSo what is an option good for? Luckily, if you are illegally using insider information, then options are a great choice to multiply your information advantage! If that doesn't apply to you, then you can use them as lottery tickets to scalp sharp price swings for the greatest amount of leverage possible.\n\nIf you expect slow but certain price movements, then you may prefer LEAPs, Margin, or Spreads.\n\nBeware leveraged ETFs: The max drawdown can offset profits. For example, a 10% drawdown turns into a 30% drawdown with 3x leverage. Your position goes from 100% to 70%. Upon regaining 10%, you regain 30%. Your position is now at 91% of its original value. Unless you have an infinite bank roll, losses are more severe than gains of equal magnitude.\n\nA 50% gain can be lost if you give back 33%\n\nA 50% loss can be recovered if you gain 100%\n\n**This is why overallocation in a zero-sum game will ultimately lead to $0, and it's easy to overallocate with leverage. This applies to every form of leverage and volatility. Granted, that's the spirit of wsb. This is why a casino will win with only a 51% advantage and also why they have max bets. You are facing off against insiders, analyst firms, and HFTs, all while you don't have an infinite bankroll, so your advantage is sub-50%.**\n\nThat being said, leveraged ETFs aren't terrible. Just be aware of the risk that are involved in it. Leveraged ETFs rebalance their leverage daily, whereas Margin leverage is not rebalanced. To put this into a simpler perspective, if a stock goes from $100 to $80 one day, and $80 to $100 the next, margin would return you to the original value whereas a leveraged ETF would return you to 96% of your original value. This is usually inconsequential, but over many many days of stagnant/sideways returns, this may add up.\n\n*Q: \"How do I turn a profit?\"*\n\nA: Get lucky, obtain an information advantage, or invest long-term to reap inflation &amp; appreciation\n\n*Q: \"How do I get an information advantage?\"*\n\nA: With hyper-autistic levels of DD, or befriend a senator/other insider.\n\n*Q: \"Okay thanks, that's everything\"*\n\nA: I'm glad you asked. An option spread is a combination of two or more options together to form a play. The advantages are that you can negate Theta, Vega, and even short volatility without having to sell naked (which is not an option on the Robinhood platform). You may recognize the term \"Box spread\" from a particular retard who made Robinhood change their terms and conditions.\n\nHere is an ATM call debit spread on TSLA ($1045c 1/21 buy, $1050c 1/21 sell for $258 entry $500 max profit):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL DEBIT SPREAD](https://preview.redd.it/3ylgs3rkoub81.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52f98cb900aae5264619f7bf8099040c1fede19)\n\nA 48% chance to almost double your money is much more in line with what most of you are looking for. Double $8k four times and you will have around $128k.\n\nAdvantages: Neutral theta (positive or negative depending on whether it's ITM or OTM), little to no Vega, very efficient leverage, cheap option spread (the pictured above only costs $258 to enter). You retain a lot of value near expiration if the stock is not going your way. Look at -2% from 2 days out on the above chart. You lose roughly half of your spread's value despite being OTM and very close to expiry. However, as I will mention again soon: The lower liquidity will likely make this a worse deal upon entry and exit.\n\nDisadvantages: Much less opportunity to scalp. Option is meant to expire to receive full value, so you're usually riding the option until it's dead. On rare occasions, the ITM option you sold may be exercised, but your broker is supposed to take care of this for you. There is less liquidity, so you will have a harder time entering and exiting trades at fair prices since you're eating liquidity two times upon entry, and two times upon exit (if you choose to exit at any point). And, most importantly, there is less overall leverage. There is not a linear leverage like options with infinite gains; your gains are capped with a max gain and max loss. Though Risk/Reward is superior, the maximum possible reward is inferior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYOLO $TSLA 1150c 1/21",

    "title": "White Gold Rush: Lithium America\u2019s Corp (LAC)",
    "selftext": "Currently those commies in China control 80% of the worlds Lithium supply. Well, Uncle Sam wants to take this back and there is one business with the American flag at their back which will be doing this $LAC. \n\nLAC have exclusive mining rights to Nevada Thacker\u2019s Pass, the second largest Lithium reserve in the world &amp;amp; the largest in North America. \n\nAs a base start for your intro to LAC there is a great interview recently with the CEO Jonathan Edwards here: The market for lithium: A metal miner with an out of this world valuation (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html) don\u2019t let the alarmist headline throw you, the CEO handles the value question straight out of the gate. \n\nOkay, so you haven\u2019t watched the video and instead just googled LAC seen it\u2019s up a bunch and think, meh this isn\u2019t for me, well, let\u2019s look at the catalysts that are coming up: \n\nCatalysts:\n\nThacker Pass approval, the judge just denied the appeal to stop construction. Ground is being broken people! Whilst this isn\u2019t the final judgement, it is a great step in the right direction; two of the attorney\u2019s for those trying to stop the mine just quit. Final judgement is in March and I expect the price to keep climbing ahead of the inevitable approval. \n\nUSA USA USA! It has political desire to take back lithium production from the measly 1% it currently gets itself and is subsiding hugely lithium production at home - see BBB, or whatever they replace it with &amp;amp; other legislation. The USA won\u2019t allow a major ingredient in industry to be at the hands of the CCP and potential tariffs. LAC is going to be the key USA based supplier of this &amp;amp; all other based innovations/products that come from lithium. This will be reflected in legislation, if they can every agree to write and vote on any. \n\nLithium prices are rising exponentially - Google Lithium prices - and are much needed in the clean tech revolution; EV, battery etc. \n\nLAC has just received multiple price upgrades and has a 80-90% buy rating by analysts. \n\nRecently approved acquisition to a further mine, taking total to 3. \n\nPotential partners including Ford, GM and TSLA - the CEO JE states, we are in numerous talks with people regarding potential partners and are under NDA. TSLA ain\u2019t far away from this mine\u2026 just saying. \n\nElsewhere: \n\nLook, we all have picked a sports, I mean Car team, whether you are Ford or TSLA or GM or Lucid or are a GME ape who thinks they will make EV cars soon as well, every man and his dog is scrambling to build as many EV\u2019s as possible, ice cars will be out of production by 2030. They will all require huge lithium to get through the EV arms race. In a world at war, the arms dealers get rich. \n\nThere is a less visible battery race going on this needs lots of lithium. \n\nJust signed off on another mine taking their total to 3. \n\nJonathan Evan\u2019s is a rockstar CEO. \n\nYour complaints: \n\nAnother business with no revenue!? Yes, but by the time they are making loads of revenue the share price will be a lot higher. Speculate to accumulate my regarded brothers. \n\nThose tribes &amp;amp; eco warriors are against it; well yes and no, a lot of the tribes peeps are for the mine due to the prosperity &amp;amp; jobs it will bring. In terms of climate, the impact study shows this will be a huge net positive in the fight against climate change. Biden has committed to fighting climate change at COP26. It hot outside and we got to stop it. \n\nInflation! Rate rises! This can be offset by the rise in demand and price of lithium + the subsidies by the USA gov for lithium production. LAC also has an excellent balance sheet to weather this. \n\nMy position: \n\nI am in for $30K with an avg 3x leverage at $29 per share. \nI plan to run up this up to it hitting $45 and take profit. Then reinvest everything in straight shares. I\u2019m in Australia, so I don\u2019t have the fun of options. I can only just leverage myself to the tits. I am sure people can come up with far more regarded plays that will make bank! Also, I\u2019m in Australia, we make a lot of money from digging shit out of the ground. \n\nTL;DR: LAC is going to make lithium, lithium make EV go brrrrr. USA need to take lithium away from China. LAC make USA go purrr. Lithium is white gold. \n\n(Wrote this on the mobile because couldn\u2019t be bothered to open the laptop.)\n\nNot financial advice. I have been wrong often in the past. Do your own googling.\n\nEdit: just to be clear, the main point here is that the USA needs to get Lithium out of the ground in its own back yard. The USA is not trying to make money from LAC directly (which is a Canadian based company) rather it needs LAC to supply all it\u2019s own industry\u2019s with Lithium. LAC\u2019s origins isn\u2019t important, but if it was Canada and China hate each other; see the whole Huawei thing. Canada and USA are staunch brothers obvs. LAC giveth the USA lithium.\n\nEdit 2: clarifying American lithium backing: \n\nAs responded in thread source SA: \n\n\u201cThe Government Wants Lithium\n\nLooking past the trendy word crafting, we can see the Biden administration is behind lithium much like the Trump administration was. Looking at the December 13th, 2021 statement we see the following highlights:\n\n1. \"The Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) will establish a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation focused on deploying EV infrastructure.\"\n\n2. $5 billion in funding for a national charging network.\n\n3. $2.5 billion in additional charger funding.\n\n4. Target of 50% EV penetration by 2030.\n\n5. DOT will publish standards for EV chargers.\n\n6. \"Increase domestic manufacturing of EV batteries and components and advance environmentally responsible domestic sourcing and recycling of critical minerals.\"\n\n7. \"$17 billion in loan authority in the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to support the domestic battery supply chain. LPO will leverage full statutory authority to finance key strategic areas of development and fill deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will include the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers of advanced technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping, expanding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the United States.\"\n\n8. \"Leverage $13 million in FEMP's Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies grants to unlock an estimated $260 million or more in project investments, including battery storage projects.\"\n\n9. \"Funded two dozen teams to expand sourcing of lithium from geothermal brines and approved a permit for the Nevada-based Thacker Pass lithium mine.\"\n\n10. \"Automakers are also signing contracts that leverage domestic supply, including Ford sourcing lithium from recycled content through Redwood Materials, GM sourcing lithium from geothermal brines in the Salton Sea with Controlled Thermal Resources, and Tesla sourcing lithium from a Piedmont project in North Carolina.\"\n\n11. \"$7 billion in funding to accelerate innovations and facilities across the battery supply chain from battery materials refining, processing and manufacturing to battery manufacturing, including components, to battery recycling and reuse. These investments will support the development of a North American battery supply chain, help expand manufacturing and recycling facilities in the United States and substantially advance the battery recycling through research, development and demonstration projects in collaboration with retailers as well as state and local governments.\"\n\nEdit 3: TSLA link \n\nSee interview Q at 2.30 with CEO: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html\n\nEdit 4: additional information \n\n\nUser lenraleigh left the following comment in the thread below which adds more depth to the DD; big thanks to them for highlighting these additional bits! \n\nComment: \n\nImportant points:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Cauchar\u00ed will be producing in mid 2022.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC just purchased Millennial.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC has been investing in Arena Minerals. Millennial's lithium brine project, Pastos Grandes is immediately adjacent to Arena's Sal de la Puna project. Arena is an exploration company and it makes sense that LAC will want to buy that as well.\n\u2022\t\u2060LAC has something like $400m cash on hand. This gives them a tremendous amount of leverage when selecting a partner for Thacker Pass.\n\u2022\t\u2060So you see, LAC is not just Thacker Pass. They aspire to be a \"major\" Lithium producer and have been making very strategic moves. They have Thacker Pass. They have Cauchar\u00ed. They have Pastos Grandes. They will likely have Sal de la Puna. The quality and quantity of Lithium they will likely be producing in a few years is amazing.\n\u2022\t\u2060Problems in Chile and other countries are going to lead to more good new for LAC and other producers in the USA and Argentina.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a long term LAC holder and began accumulating in Feb 2017. LAC has changed my life. I personally scaled out a bit at $18 and will trim a bit around $50 (or whenever it overtakes too much of my portfolio.) IMO we'll see $100+ one day, and I'll still be holding. It's probably not a good stock to \"get rich quick\" on, although, many people do believe it will run up into the 40's over the next several weeks.\n\nFWIW I got lucky and found Joe Lowry's \"Global Lithium\" podcast back in the day. It's the one podcast I listen to and it is gold. LAC's geologist has been on there, and so has the CEO.\n\nEdit 5: \n\nTL;DR (revised courtesy of Professional_Call_41) \n\nLAC is going to $100 this year. With Judge Du Approval in March + DFS + strategic partner + retail/institutional FOMO all in lockstep and in the coming months\u2026 mix in production at CO by year end and it\u2019s a no brainer\u2026 this all WITHOUT considering the structurally short Lithium supply/demand issues that are here to stay and worsening by the day.\n\nIf there\u2019s one companies stock with the right story, management team, deposit, and time in history all lining up for a massive surge, it\u2019s this one.\n\nViva LAC",

    "title": "TIL: One of the most explosive dot com IPOs, LNUX, is a subsidiary of GME",
    "selftext": "While watching the [PBS Frontline documentary, 'Dot Con'](https://youtu.be/TnazfW1T-ks), which takes a look back at the dot com bubble and burst of '99/00, they mentioned a particularly spectacular IPO of a linux company called 'VA Linux' trading under the $LNUX ticker.\n\n[It IPO'd on Dec 9, 1999 at $30 and rose to $320 intraday and closed at $250, a whopping +733%:](https://www.wired.com/1999/12/va-linux-sets-ipo-record/)\n\n&gt;Analysts said [VA Linux](http://www.valinux.com/)'s astounding IPO had less to do with the fundamentals of the company than with the general hoopla among investors about anything remotely tied to the Linux operating system.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"VA Linux only did as well as it did because of the price performance of Red Hat,\" said David Menlow, president of [IPOfinancial.com](http://www.ipofinancial.com/).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The first Linux-related issue to hit the market this year, Red Hat Software has skyrocketed in recent days. The company's stock has risen 1,837 percent since its IPO, making it the best-performing new issue of the year, according to Renaissance Capital.\n\nHow truly incredible to think that at one time, companies like Netscape and Red Hat Linux were leaders in the market.\n\n[It subsequently declined heavily with the dot com crash:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet)\n\n&gt;On December 8, 2000, one year later, after the bursting of the [dot com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_com_bubble), shares traded at $8.49/share.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet#cite_note-14) In January 2001, the stock traded at $7.13/share.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geeknet#cite_note-easycome-2) By December 2002, it was worth just $1.19/share.\n\n[LNUX price 09.09.99 - 09.12.00](https://preview.redd.it/kqp3a3b833c81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708671f7d2d300157563f37539a4a547f5e21b6a)\n\nVA Linux transitioned to VA Software (stock plunges 42% in one day after an earnings warning), moving away from hardware, then to a proprietary version of SourceForge, then 'GeekNet' then through a number of transitions to 'ThinkGeek' which was [eventually acquired by GameStop on June 2, 2015 for $140 million in a bidding competition with Hot Topic of all things...](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/gamestop-outbids-hot-topic-for-thinkgeek-parent-company-purchase/)\n\nHow bizarre, it's really fascinating looking back at the media and headlines surrounding the speculative investing of the euphoric lead up into the end of 1999. You eventually start to see headlines of Greenspan talking about cooling the economy with rate hikes and the translation into severe choppiness in the NASDAQ in particular, with 3-4% and even 14% intraday drawdowns, short lived recoveries, and further selloffs.\n\nAnyhow, I suppose holding GME means also holding a piece of dot com history as well, two decades later \ud83e\udd72Looking forward to what remarkable future it hodls for when it gets acquired by TSLA in 2040.",

    "title": "QS expanding beyond EV market, it is a great move. Expect sooner revenue. I was asking this for long time, finally they did.",
    "selftext": "QuantumScape Is Expanding Beyond Electric Vehicles. It's a Huge Move. \n\nSolid state battery technology company QuantumScape is moving beyond electric vehicles, looking at applying its rechargeable battery technology into the market for stationary power applications. It opens up a new, potentially huge, market for the company. \n\nQuantumScape (ticker: QS) announced a partnership Thursday with Fluence Energy (FLNC) designed to introduce solid-state lithium-based rechargeable batteries into stationary power applications. \n\nSolid state, in the case of QuantumScape, means the company's batteries don't have a liquid in them facilitating electrical current. Today's lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from cells phones to EVs, have liquid electrolytes. \n\nGoing solid state can improve battery safety and lower costs. That's great news for the EV industry. Batteries still drive the biggest cost difference between electric and traditional gasoline-powered cars. But lower costs and better safety are desirable features for any battery application. \n\nBatteries are being used for backup power generation applications, like in the case of a Tesla (TSLA) Powerwall. Batteries are also being used by utilities to help make renewable power generation available 24-7 by storing wind and solar energy in huge battery packs, like in the case of a Tesla Megapack. \n\nTesla, of course, has a small stationary power business along with its larger EV business. QuantumScape now seems to be pursing a similar path. \n\n\"Fluence and QuantumScape share the same mission to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and adoption of energy storage technologies, so our collaboration is a natural fit,\" said QuantumScape CEO Jagdeep Singh in the company's news release. \"While we have historically focused on automotive applications, we believe our battery technology is broadly applicable and can play a role in other sectors contributing to a lower-carbon future.\" \n\nQuantumScape estimates that stationary power installations will grow to a $385 billion annual market opportunity by the end of the decade, up from less than $20 billion today. Global electric-vehicle sales might amount to $2 trillion by then. The batteries going into those EVs might generate $250 billion in sales for battery makers. Those are all theoretical numbers, but the potential for both markets is large for QuantumScape and other battery makers. \n\nInvestors, however, don't appear to be thinking about 2030 just yet. QuantumScape stock was down about 2.2% in trading Thursday at $20.49. Fluence stock fell about 3.2%. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.3%. \n\n.",

    "selftext": " \n\nGlobal Macro\n\nU.S. bond yields hit another record high, U.S. stock index futures lower\n\nAt the start of the Asian session on Tuesday, the 10-year U.S. bond yield quickly rose above the 1.81% mark early in the session, the highest level since January 2020. 2-year U.S. bond yields also broke through 1% for the first time since February 2020. At press time, U.S. stock futures were lower, with the Nasdaq futures down 1.44%, the S&amp;P 500 futures down 0.87% and the Dow futures down 0.69%.\n\nGoldman Sachs, \"Flag Bearer of the Commodity Bull Market,\" Remains Steadfast in its Bullish View for a Decade\n\nJeff Currie, head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, discusses some of the key themes that could shape commodity prices in the coming decades, and once again reiterates his view that he has been bullish on commodities markets for the past year. Not long ago, the bank reportedly said it was \"extremely bullish\" on commodities and sees a possible decade-long supercycle.\n\nDanske Bank: Fed expected to raise rates 4 times this year, start tapering in September\n\nIf the U.S. economy develops in line with expectations, the Fed may raise interest rates for the first time in March, supported by a tight labor market and still-high inflation. The number of Fed rate hikes this year is expected to increase from three to four (in March, June, September and December, respectively), with each hike of 25 basis points. In addition, it is expected to start tapering in September. Given the strong economy and higher underlying inflation, we believe the risk of tightening tends to increase rather than decrease.\n\nBank of America Survey: Investors reduce net position in technology sector to lowest level since December 2008\n\nBank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey for January showed that fund managers' net allocations to the technology sector fell 20% sequentially to 1%, the lowest level since 2008. They expect inflation levels to fall this year and are betting on a record overall boom in commodities and equities. In addition, a monthly survey conducted by Deutsche Bank found that most respondents believe U.S. technology stocks are in a bubble, as investors remain very pessimistic about the Fed's hawkish turn and rising U.S. bond yields.\n\nHot News\n\nStar Tech Stocks Weak in Pre-Market, Nvidia, Tesla Down More Than 2%\n\nAs of writing, $Nvidia ([NVDA.US](https://nvda.us/))$ and $Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ are down over 2% premarket, while $Meta Platforms ([FB.US](https://fb.us/))$, $Amazon ([AMZN.US](https://amzn.us/))$, $Microsoft ([MSFT.US](https://msft.us/))$, $Apple ([AAPL.US](https://aapl.us/))$ and $Google-A ([GOOGL.US](https://googl.us/))$ are down over 1%.\n\nAnti-epidemic stocks lower in pre-market, BioNTech down more than 6%\n\nAs of press time, $BioNTech ([BNTX.US](https://bntx.us/))$ is down over 6% premarket, $Moderna ([MRNA.US](https://mrna.us/))$, $Novavax Pharmaceuticals ([NVAX.US](https://nvax.us/))$, $Ocugen ([OCGN.US](https://ocgn.us/))$ are down over 3%, and $Pfizer ([PFE.US](https://pfe.us/))$ is down nearly 1%.\n\nGoldman Sachs$ Q4 net revenue of $12.64 billion, down more than 4% pre-market\n\n$ Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://gs.us/))$ reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $12.64 billion, fourth-quarter investment banking revenue of $3.6 billion, fourth-quarter trading revenue of $3.99 billion, fourth-quarter equity sales and trading revenue of $2.12 billion, and fourth-quarter fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities sales and trading revenue of $1.86 billion.

For the lawyer invited more than one person to chop but the chopping progress bar did not change, Tang Jiangrong, senior director of Poundland's legal department, explained: \"Because some of the free chopped goods amount is large, pulling a small number of users to chop off the amount is not enough to make the percentage change, it will make consumers think that the chopping price has not changed.\n\nAzure's U.S. subsidiary is reported to have recently signed a ten-year lease for an office building in San Jose, California, doubling the footprint of its headquarters compared to the current one, with nearly 18,580 square meters of office space after the expansion.

    "selftext": "Greetings my fellow bears. Feels good to come out of the closet for 2022! Seeing all the bear pride in the daily discussion has given me the motivation to make some bear porn DD for y'all. I'm gonna make it short and sweet, let's get right into it.\n\nIn the past 5 years, the VIX 50 day sma has only broke above the 200 day sma three times: during volmagedon in feb 2018, the rate hike in sept 2018, and march 2020. Each of these scenarios lead to a parabolic squeeze in the VIX index and i**t happened again this week.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[50 day sma \\(red\\) and 200 day sma \\(blue\\) on the VIX](https://preview.redd.it/9j8x9tft5rc81.png?width=3778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de873787dc5da76833354ebbc0cef1ed0d985bd9)\n\nDoesn't that graph just make your dick twitch a little? Yeah me too. In the coming trading sessions I will be watching this trend closely to make sure it's a clean break. A reversal is possible such as the one marked by the R on the graph, so be weary of this. Personally, I think it's gonna moon sometime in 2022, but then again, I lost $100k on TSLA puts last year so trade at your own risk. 2022 is the year of the bear. For any bulls alive out there, there's still time to salvage your gaped portfolios.\n\nOh yeah, and my UVXY price target is $1000. That is all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Positions:\n\n800 shares of UVXY $11.91 cost basis in my Roth\n\n520 shares of UVXY $13.34 cost basis in my gambling fund\n\n11 UVXY 70c March 18 '22\n\nI will continue to accumulate shares and calls on green market days and will most likely fomo in if UVXY cracks 40.",

Don't try to time the market or you will end up with massive losses.\n\nTake a deeper look. A lot of stocks have already passed huge correction. Small caps were beaten for the whole 2021. Right now it's probably the best time to invest in some more or less adequate small cap companies that are targeting for growth. Do your DD, there's a plenty.\n\nLarge caps are being corrected these days. The big tech sell off is the ultimate reason why S&amp;P and NASDAQ are pointing down, since big tech was pulling major indexes up in 2021. Wait for a week or two and continue buying your favorite large caps, like AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, etc.\n\nThe market is not gonna nosedive in the same way as it did in 2020, so stop even thinking about getting rich overnight. 2022 is probably gonna be harsh for the stock market, but there's no reason to blindly lose money.\n\nDon't be a greedy retard, be a smart retard.

    "title": "Missed the NFLX ER? A look at upcoming earnings - MSFT, TSLA, INTC, AAPL, HOOD and V.",
    "selftext": "Missed the $NFLX ER? You and everyone else is currently looking at the next $NFLX like earnings play. One thing is for sure, tech earnings will be volatile and results at the tail end will be more likely than usual. Tail ends are usually hard to predict and the statistic models that calculate premiums usually underestimate them. So it might be the best time to steal from thetagang.\n\nThat said, I think we'll see two types of tech ER scenarios going forward. Type 1 will be a $NFLX repeat, taking everyone by surprise. More likely will be type 2, everyone is getting scared and the stock tanks before ER and goes up after or stays flat. \n\nLet's look at next week, afaik all of these are after hours:\n\n**Tuesday -  $MSFT**\n\n\nDown 13.5% from ATH (historically a lot for Microsoft). \n\nP/E is 33.11, EPS is in a healthy uptrend (P/E - price / earnings, EPS - earnings per share).\n\nI think this will be type 2: will tank like the rest of the market before Tues, but the actual ER will be fine. Might even be a good idea to go long on this.\n\n**Wednesday - $TSLA $INTC $NOW**\n\n\nThat's where it gets real interesting. Tesla. P/E at an astronomical 306, that is, it is priced for high growth. Everyone already expects a super bullish $TSLA ER, the slightest hint at growth problems and it might tank spectacularily. Elon is currently also down on gambling with company funds on \ud83c\udf3d, but its probably not gonna be significant enough of a loss. \n\nI preface this that anyone betting against Elon is already bankrupt, but I think this could be a type 1, given that there is a chance for guidance and growth expectations to be lowered. They will probably still beat earnings for the quarter though, as they beat their delivery goals. Downside is that puts will be expensive and only pay out on a large enough move.\n\nThen there also Intel reporting on Wednesday, $INTC is a boomer shit stock that likes to drop on earnings as well. P/E is currently at 10 though. The current market seems to punish high P/E companies more than low P/E companies. While we wouldn't expect much growth with a P/E this low, at 10 we could also say that Intel is a value stock currently and there's better tech stocks to go short on.\n\nServiceNow ($NOW) also is one of these P/E high flyers. Trailing P/E of 90.99 (so averaged over 12 months). Based on the last ER some sites report as high as a 466.29 P/E, but obviously that may be wildly off if their earnings are a bit more seasonal. But I've seen forward estimates over 100 as well. They have a product for companies for tracking and managing business procedures. I haven't used it but seems it overall NOW seems to track and correlate a lot with SPY.  \n\n**Thursday - $AAPL, $HOOD, $V, $TEAM**\n\n\n\n$AAPL - P/E ratio 28 and EPS in healthy uptrend. Q4 is also a really strong quarter for them usually. Not enough conviction to go long on this one yet, on the other hand I also wouldn't short it. But its likely going to be a Type 2. If it drops some more, BTFD might be a good idea.\n\n$HOOD seems like the obvious short, given that they are losing money left and right. But they are already down 80% from their highs so I think there might be not enough meat on the bone left. Maybe it even squeezes, if they can guide higher due to higher Q1 volatility. If thats what makes them earn more money. It's still an absolute POS stock. If it goes up after ER, that would be a good time to short it.\n\n$V - P/E 36.60\n\nVisa is down 11% from a July 2021 ATH. Financial companies have been under pressure for some time. For me a boomer company, not likely to have an outsized earnings reaction, but who knows maybe this was the non obvious one to go down.\n\n$TEAM - Trailing P/E 187.9. Down 38% from ATH.\n\nThis might fit the bill for a bloated company that got boosted by WFH and covid. Maybe there's still some downside left if the report is bad. Atlassian is mostly known for the dev/wiki like platform everyone hates, Confluence.\n\nDisclaimer: I have no positions in any of the mentioned companies at this time. Should $AAPL and/or $MSFT go down more before ER, I might think about going long shares/calls. For a lotto ticket I'd go with $TSLA OTM puts, still not sure if I really want to bet against Elon and will do more DD. $TEAM and $NOW could also be candidates for going short.\n\nEdit: added $TEAM and $NOW to the list.\n\nTook no positions.\n\nHow the predictions turned out so far:\n\nMSFT up | was up nicely next day\n\nTSLA down |  ~~flat AH~~ down next day\n\nNOW down | +10% next day\n\nINTC maybe slightly down | ~~slightly down AH~~ down next day\n\nAAPL up | up AH\n\nHOOD no idea, maybe squeeze | ~~down~~ squeeze next day\n\nV no idea | nicely up next day\n\nTEAM down | up AH, up next day",

EV cars is like gas cars back then but never commanded a huge P/E. Cars are utility, goes A-B. When people see through that self driving tech is a decade away (prob due to city infrastructure to support self-driving and political red tape \\[nobody is rushing to have a self-driving car\\]), we can see some downside or relatively flatness or bearish on it.\n\nReal estate - bubble.... everywhere... Cheap money borrowed from the Feds. Canada's YOY RE prices has gone up 27%. There is no supply issue because we had this supply issue pre-pandemic but we never popped 27% in a single year or even close to it. People are balls deep in mortgage payments, and those who got in late is even more screwed.\n\nmetaVerse - a pandemic by product - too early to tell how to monetize this space. You can tell companies have been doing this, CS GO - skins, Diablo 3 - marketplace. These have not taken off in any dramatic way so we can gauge consumer sentiment to spend money in a virtual reality.\n\nAI innovations- this would be deflation.\n\nSPY top holdings are BIG TECH. Big tech was the major theme of the pandemic hedge which ended up being great winners. Re-opening is a negative for all these companies and the pandemic is basically over after this year.\n\nThe thing trading at 35k right now. This that have no value, is speculation. Speculation ends up being a bubble. EVEN if this thing is the next best thing, we are too early. All this cheap money finding new ideas to generate an ungodly P/L is basically, a matter bubble.\n\nWarren Buffett - ATH cash holdings. Going to wait out for the market to kick out the froth.\n\nChina - Imposing tons of new regulations to soften their markets, whether it be RE market (tax on developers), big tech (listing and fines, all regulations), ensuring the COMMON prosperity can continue (most China markets are/were already inflated before this initiative was introduced). China is basically a step ahead of the US Feds in controlling their economic cycles.\n\nRead this, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp), then reflect on life around you, then read it again.

    "title": "ARKK is a Sinking Ship: Practical Portfolio Construction Theory",
    "selftext": "I see a lot of memes and arguments about the fate of ARKK and Cathie Wood. I wrote this post to give everyone the definitive guide to what happens from here with ARKK. At this point, the losses are accelerating. Nothing can save this sinking ship (see what I did there?).\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that ARKK is not an etf in the traditional sense. Cathie Wood actively trades the portfolio and has made some serious portfolio construction errors. Even if the underlying stocks can stem the hemorrhage, it is more than likely that these mistakes are large enough to disband the ETF.\n\n1. **Concentration risk 1**: too much of the portfolio is concentrated in too few stocks. This is an issue because even if she is right on 9/10 stocks, one stinker can impact the entire performance. Right now, the biggest risk is Tesla. Even if her other positions recover somewhat, if Tesla falls (not saying it will, but IF) then this will be the death knell for the entire portfolio.\n2. **Concentration Risk 2**: ARKK owns multiple trading days worth of stock for some of these companies. The problem with this is if Cathie Wood has to sell a position, she cannot sell many of her holdings without tanking the price of the underlying. This risk is actually baked into ARKK since any up and coming tech company will by definition have fewer investors trying to buy in every day and thus fewer shares trading. You don't liquidate when you want to. You liquidate when you have to.\n3. **Correlation risk**: all of her stocks are affected by the same macro themes. it doesn't make sense that TSLA and Coinbase drop together, but both companies benefit from a low interest rate environment. If anything happens to the macro environment that effects market liquidity or general P/E multiples, then her entire portfolio will take a hit at the same time.\n\nIn general, you want a portfolio with uncorrelated assets. this is because if one asset goes up or down for non-fundamental reasons, you can arbitrage that against your other assets and wait for the securities to be rationally priced. Cathie doesn't have this option.\n\n4) **Liquidity risk:** ARKK owns large amounts of illiquid companies. If Cathie has to sell them off, ARKK is so big that their selling will have a material effect on the stock price. In general, this is why big dogs don't mess with small caps. If you buy enough to make a difference in your portfolio, then there is not enough liquidity to exit if you need to.\n\n**THE MECHANISM**: when you buy/sell your ARKK shares, the market cap of ARKK deviates from the Net Asset Value (NAV). This can be corrected when a market maker trades ARKK for ARKK shares or the underlying asset.\n\n**Example**: if ARKK is going up because people are buying it, then the market cap will grow larger than all of the assets that ARKK owns. Cathie Wood can then print up more ARKK shares for free, and exchange them with a market maker who will buy up the proper amounts of the underlying assets. This increases the amount of assets that ARKK owns while keeping the market cap the same, which brings the market cap and Net Assets into balance.\n\nWhen ARKK is going up, this has the effect of placing huge buying pressure on illiquid names. Since there are not that many sellers at any given price, the stock of the company will increase to draw more sellers into the market. This is especially true since ARKK got so big that it became a huge player in comparison to the companies it was buying.\n\n**Example**: if ARKK is going down because people are selling, the market cap will deviate lower than the NAV. In this case, Cathie has to trade shares of the underlying to a market maker who buys ARKK shares in the market. Since the market maker is getting more shares\n\nWhen ARKK is going down in market cap, a market maker gives Cathie ARKK shares and takes the underlying stocks in exchange to sell them. This is horrible if you are selling a large number of shares into into an illiquid market. large sell orders will push the price of the stock you are selling even further down.\n\n**The vicious cycle Cathie Wood is experiencing:**\n\nNon-profitable Tech falls\u2014&gt; All of ARKK takes a hit because it is all correlated\u2014&gt; people sell their shares--&gt; Cathie Wood is forced to sell the underlying holdings\u2014&gt; The underlying holdings are very illiquid, so the stock price falls--&gt; Repeat.\n\nCathie Wood attempted to break out of this pattern by selling her Tesla shares and rebalancing into her other holdings. This worked for a while because Tesla had an amazing run and ARKK could offload millions of shares without changing the price. The final nail in the coffin was Elon Must selling his shares. The market was forced to absorb so many Tesla shares that Cathie Wood could no longer sell the quantity of shares she needed to without tanking the stock.\n\n**Why ARKK will not recover even if Tech does:**\n\nIf a huge whale stepped in to accumulate ARKK shares, Cathie Wood could issue more ARKK shares to buy more of the underlying companies. However, right now there are a huge number of people sitting on losses in many of these names. Any rally in these names will be seen as a selling opportunity to people who are pretty far in the red at the moment.\n\nEven if ARKK investors are diamond handed investors, the companies themselves have decided to sell shares into the artificial demand created by ARKK. If you look at filings, many of the companies ARKK owns have decided to dilute shares to fund their business ventures.\n\n**In short, ARKK is a sinking ship. Get out while you can.**\n\nHow can you benefit from this knowledge? I bought 30 ARKK Puts at a strike price of $42, expiring January 2023. I am currently up 300% profit on this trade. If ARKK fails completely, I would have turned $3,000 into $120,000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3auaehndrhe81.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ebebdb30d67c784981103220b36447f9c0da79d",

Now the snap back will be multi-decade and will result in significantly higher oil prices.\n\nThe average oil company in XOP is trading at 6x EV/FCF. The average tech company 's value is all based on the future (10 years+) while the value of oil companies is nearly all based on profitability and cash flow in the next few years. This makes tech extremely sensitive to interest rates while oil is barely effected by it. Given oil is a big driver in the economy, effecting the price of both energy (nat gas) and tons of inputs in everything from fertilizer, good, plastics, any sort of industrial chemicals, high oil prices means high inflation and higher rates come for the next decade.\n\nOn to the technicals, as you can see in the first chart, Oil is in a falling narrowing wedge while tech is a rising widening wedge. This is super bullish for oil as it is clearly breaking out and tech looks like it may test the bottom side of its range with a risk that it drops below it. \n\nHave 300k+ in XOP across multiple accounts (both brokerage and IRA, here is a couple)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/MZRUYg0](https://imgur.com/a/MZRUYg0)",

    "selftext": "# All my screenshots can be found here: [https://imgur.com/a/HgDZco2](https://imgur.com/a/HgDZco2)\n\nI started out with **$17K** on Monday hoping to make some good earnings bet this week. \n\n\\- My first win was $UPS call which I gained almost **+$40K**. The thesis I had there was: less bad Winter weathers, surging delivery numbers between people due to Omicron and holidays. (Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sja4lw/42k\\_gains\\_in\\_ups\\_earning\\_call\\_im\\_up\\_a\\_lot\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sja4lw/42k_gains_in_ups_earning_call_im_up_a_lot_this/))\n\n\\- On Wednesday, after selling my $UPS calls, I had roughly around **$60K** and I was so happy. So I started swinging $SPY calls and Puts + $FB Calls (pre-earning) which helped me to reach **$90K** on the same day. Yah, it was truly wild experience... I had almost $30K in $FB 350c but I sold like $27K because it was too much risk and I'm thankful for that. \n\n\\- The next day however, I had around $74K to begin with but made a huge mistake swinging $SPY calls and puts which made my account to become around $42K (lost about $25K). I was really pissed and although I gained more from previous days, it felt like I lost money. **So I decided to YOLO into $SNAP calls. I bought $30 calls with 200 contracts which was roughly around \\~$19K.** The thesis was that I thought $SNAP just simply dropped due to $FB and if the earning turns out to be good, I thought it'll at least go back where it was. And fortunately, I was right after the bell.\n\n\\- You can probably see from the screenshot, I gained a huge amount when the bell opened. However, pre-market didn't hold up. If it did, my calls would've been around $160K gains but it was only just over a half of that. So, I didn't feel like it was enough and although I gained money, it felt like I lost money HAHAHA.\n\n\\- So, I started to swing $SPY calls and puts again. However, I thought the job report + Biden talk was already priced in and people wouldn't care much about it. So, I stopped buying puts and went in on buying calls (including $TSLA calls). **This helped me to reach $200K today and right now, I sold everything so that I can enjoy the weekend, let me money settle so that I can cash out $150K and start again with $50K.**",

    "title": "\"F\" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!",
    "selftext": "**Product Line**\n\nTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV\u2019s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. \n\n**Margins**\n\nTesla\u2019s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin \u2013 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross \u2013 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that\u2019s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. \n\n**Valuation &amp; Market Share** \n\nThe most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford\u2019s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla\u2019s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That\u2019s changing now!! \n\nTesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that\u2019s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV\u2019s \n\n\u00b7**Moat**\n\nTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV\u2019s and automation. With time and effort that\u2019s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV\u2019s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. \n\n**Marketing**\n\nTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!\n\n **High Interest rate Environment** \n\nWe are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. \n\n\u00b7**Team**\n\nLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford\u2019s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer",

I don't like this Casino's odds right now and I want guaranteed tendies again.\n\n**Obviously, the best way to make guaranteed money is by doing what this wrinkle-brained ape said 6 months ago:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p26zj4/how\\_to\\_beat\\_the\\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p26zj4/how_to_beat_the_market/)\n\n*However, some of you apes aren't allowed within 500 feet of a school and the rest of us are too dumb to become teachers so there really is only one logical play left for most of us:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Apply to tons of grad schools for an MBA. One will have to accept you.  Literally any school will do(except for the University of Phoenix.  We had a guy with his MBA from there and all the bosses just called him Phoenix instead of Dave.  Dave never got promoted and was constantly mocked until he quit.  Don't be Dave)\n2. Take out as many **FEDERAL** loans as you can get. They are free money. The government will keep deferring the repayment of these loans due to perpetual upcoming elections and the indefinite existence of COVID.  Eventually some politician will forgive all loans when the amount-owed is determined to be negligible due to runaway inflation.\n3. Graduate and Apply for a job as an ANALyst.  Make sure you say buzz words like \"Beta' ,'DCF' 'Porter's Five forces' and 'SWOT analysis.'  This will indicate that you actually got a worthless MBA. *Do not, for any reason, mention WSB during the interview*\n4. Once you have convinced some sucker to hire you, simply follow the rules of being an ANALyst\n\n**HOW TO BE AN ANALYST(it's really this easy):**\n\n\\-If you work at Company A, just copy what the Company B analyst says.\n\n*Fun fact:* Other analysts will provide charts and all the other research that you will need to create your own presentations and charts.  Always set your price target slightly higher than those other analysts.  Think of it like the Price is Right.\n\n\\-Wait til earnings come out and then revise your estimate based on market movement.  For example, this week, reset your AMZN target for $3500 since it appears to be going back up.  Set your FB target for $215 since it obviously tanked and your previous $420.69 target is clearly not going to work out anymore.   As for any stock you own illegally, make sure to set those targets really high to capitalize on the quick upward movement when your upgrade has been released.  Then sell immediately those positions and revise your estimates down due to something like .....'supply chain constraints'.\n\n*Fun fact:* As an analyst, you are allowed to change your mind.And remember, the SEC is not prosecuting anyone these days so why would they start with you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Total potential market for handjobs from dudes behind Wendy's is only roughly $32 million annually.  if all 11.6 million apes start doing this that only leaves about a $3 average yearly income.  Become an ANALyst instead and get paid guaranteed money for making shit up.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Digression:\\*\\*\\*\\*Why are all you rookies still giving HJs behind Wendy's?  Wendy's layouts offer horrible concealment for this. Think about how much easier it would be to jerk off dudes behind a Chipotle or Five Guys without a drive-thru line exposing every upstroke.  Plus if you choose restaurants with higher prices ,you are more likely to gain clients with higher disposable incomes... and eventually charge more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:  Obviously this is actually financial advice,  Get a free degree and get paid by companies like GS and JPM for literally being the weathermen of finance.*",

    "title": "TSLA and a tale of two boomers",
    "selftext": "Sharing my general investment thesis because I think looking at history gives a unique perspective that many people glance past when they\u2019re diving deep into the weeds. For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. \n\n**Introduction** \n\nI know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let\u2019s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).\n\nBefore we go comparing apples to oranges I\u2019d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.\n\nApple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won\u2019t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won\u2019t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the\\_massive\\_fud\\_campaign\\_against\\_apples\\_iphone/](https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the_massive_fud_campaign_against_apples_iphone/) \n\n**Competition is Coming**\n\nIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png) \n\nWe can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they\u2019d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven\u2019t perfected a single one yet (see Chevy Bolt). \n\nIn 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that \u201cThey\u2019re still catching up with the first iPhone we\u2019ve moved beyond that\u201d. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases. [https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/](https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/) \n\nAnother year or so goes by and the industry realizes that Apple isn\u2019t just in the phone business but that they are also in the software business. They adjust their strategy with a reactive instead of proactive approach again to continue playing catchup. Notice that they finally included a touchscreen after claiming nobody wants one, and also attempted to do music/apps/etc. Legacy auto is currently at this stage now where they haven't really completed the first step of making nice EV's but are hyping up software buzzwords. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png) \n\n**A Cult of Personality**\n\nIn terms of the product ecosystem Apple has been noted as having a cult following of people who evangelize their products. This cult of personality has also rippled from their notably eccentric CEO Steve Jobs throughout pop-culture and through their retail investor community. We know that Wall Street hates unpredictability and likes things which are easy to analyze and fit into a certain category. \n\nTesla clearly mirrors this wild cult-like behavior from top to bottom, and arguably to an even greater extreme given Musk\u2019s social media behavior. Both of these companies have been known for being the red-headed stepchild of Wall Street due to always thinking and behaving outside the box.\n\n**A Tale of Two Boomers**\n\nMany people say hindsight is usually 20/20 however I\u2019d like to offer unique example of attempting to hone the skill of foresight. To present this I will offer a tale of two boomers I\u2019m fortunate enough to know, followed up by a personal experience of mine.\n\nMeet Bob, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to watch CNBC and talks about movement in the DOW in terms of points instead of percentages. One of the coolest family members of mine, great guy with an interesting story. \n\nBob purchased $AAPL in 1993 for around $14 ($0.31 split adjusted) and sold it around 6 months later for $19 per share ($0.42 split adjusted) which was a modest gain for holding under a year. Obviously we can see that if he would have just held he\u2019d be laughing all the way to the bank. However he is your average retail investor that buys random stock in random companies he doesn\u2019t fully understand and hasn\u2019t ever done enough research to develop the conviction to hodl.\n\nMeet Mike, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to play guitar and go fishing. His first job out of college in the early 1980\u2019s would fly him around for work and he randomly got upgraded to first class free one day on a nearly empty flight heading from San Francisco to LA. He struck up conversation with two guys named Steve and Steve who thought he may have been wealthy since he was in first class and tried to pitch him on investing in their computer company named after a fruit. Yes that\u2019s right it was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\u2026 He politely declined as he was broke and just recently graduated from college, yet reminisces of the pleasant conversation they had that day.\n\nSeveral years later he ended up getting an Apple IIC desktop computer and reflected on his conversation on that flight while he enjoyed using his new computer at work. Over the next few years he began to slowly pick up a few shares of Apple stock as he could afford to but he never had a huge disposable income as he was raising a family and working an average job. Over the next 10yrs through the ups and downs he continued slowly buying because he kept enjoying their new products. Many years have since gone by and his small position has grown into a sizable one which enabled him to achieve waterfront living in South Florida and early retirement. \n\nAbout 2 years ago Mike purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance and when I asked him how he liked it he instantly began raving about how amazing it is. He also mentioned how it reminded him of when he got his Apple IIC back in the day. Mike even stated to me that he believes Tesla is on a similar path to the one Apple took and that he began converting some of his AAPL holding to begin accumulating TSLA after he got acquainted with the product.\n\n**Muh P/E Ratio**\n\nOne of the common things people say when analyzing a growth company is \u201cThe P/E ratio is too high\u201d. P/E looks backwards at old earnings which is what should be used if you\u2019re evaluating a boomer company with cashflows that aren\u2019t growing much.  \n\nBy looking backwards instead of forward everything will look overpriced because you aren\u2019t factoring in future earnings growth. Looking at only the P/E ratio has caused many people to miss out on the best growth stories of all time. Remember the articles when AMZN had a P/E of 1200 a few years ago? Bet you wish you bought then\u2026\n\nForward P/E ratio and PEG ratio are the two metrics you should be using. I promised this post wouldn\u2019t be about numbers so do a quick google search on these sometime. \n\nMaybe do some research on TSLA\u2019s operating leverage and gross margins if you really want to dive deep ;) \n\nOnce you understand Forward P/E and PEG ratio you\u2019ll see that TSLA is currently undervalued. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMany people have done great work on DCF models and attempting to value Tesla, but I believe that other factors are hard to forecast when looking further past a 5 year time horizon. I think that things will continue to surprise people and disruptive innovation is extremely difficult to quantify. \n\nMy general thesis is that TSLA in 2022 is similar to AAPLin 2009 but with a waaayyyyyy larger TAM, curious to see how things play out :)\n\nPositions: Literally all in on TSLA June 2023 $1000C's, January 2024 $1000C's and January 2024 $1200C's",

    "selftext": "I posted this in a thread with some baggie autist \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08 pumping the puts he bought too late, but it actually became a nice \ud83d\udc02 case. So take those \ud83d\udd8d\ufe0f\ud83d\udd8d out of your nose, and strap in for a treat.\n\n1. $50 billion in cash **after** their $19 billion buyback, and yes the Zucc cucked himself by cumming too early, but hol' up\n2. It has a P/E of 16, a 4:1 asset/liability ratio, 65% YoY **increase** in cash flow, and currently trades at 15x FCF. $AAPL, $MSFT, $AMZN, $GOOG, and $TSLA have a P/E of 25-188 (lol), higher debt ratios, lower margins (FB gross margin is 80%), and trade at 27-272x FCF (guess who's at 272)\n3. Weekly (and daily) RSI are the most oversold they've been since the post-IPO dump, and the weekly is curling to put in a bottom \n4. It bounced off the May 2018 and Feb 2020 high today, delicious\n5. The VWAP is $220.78, so easily in reach\n6. Option flows are primarily being driven by Jan 2023 calls being sold, but IV is also in the 83rd percentile, so expect those to be closed out as IV decreases\n7. The current level also shows a successful test of the -2.618 Fib retrace from the September 2021 dump, with the -3 at $201. For reference, it peaked at 3 Fibs on the nose from the March 2020 crash\n8. The weekly 200 &amp; monthly 50 MA sit right at $230, so closing successfully above that willtake it to $266 and eventually $290 to attempt a gap fill\n9. The aforementioned MAs just happen to be right above the 2018/2020 trend, at $228.56\n\nThis is a great spot to dip a toe in, with a stop below $200. If we get a weekly then monthly close over $230, the party is back on.\n\n**TL;DR:** The Metadump can easily become a Metapump if we clear $230 \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15. If this works out, you can send me donations. If it craters, I'll obviously delete my rambling \ud83d\ude1c\n\n**Bonus**: Zucc can buy SPOT &amp; PTON for $45 billion (Black Mirror, anyone?), and still have enough for a super-yacht bigger than Jeff Amazon's + 300 000 metric **fucktons** of cocaine to make these hoes dance. Oh and he'll get $5 billion in cash minus transaction costs from the acquisitions, and be back at $50 billion in cash in a year",

As we Move Forward and watch the Old Die Off - Revolution and Evolution Gives Way To New Birth, as in the Past, \"From Horses To Cars, Carriages To Trains -  time is repeating itself from Fossil Fuel and ery industry linked to it - to **ZERO Emissions** and Electric Vehicles and all that is being created through The Technology!!! Welcome To The EV Revolution!!\n\nIn The Past - The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 ... HISTORY LESSON -  Industrial Revolution, in modern history, **the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing**. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society. ..... Today we are repeating the process with New Technology from A.I, MetaVerse to The EV Space and today I wanted to share those industries that will help support and grow That SPACE - Charging Stations....\n\nI like $EVGO for so many reasons...  formerly Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation, is a public fast charging network for electric vehicles (EVs). The Company's fast charging network is powered by renewable energy.  It Provides charging services close to where drivers live, work and play, whether for a daily commute or a commercial fleet.

Many Retail investors will miss this portion of the EV Revolution... while we chase $LCD, $TSLA and $RVIN.... they all need Charging Stations - Just like our Past Billionaires Knew - The World would Need Fossil Fuels... Think On This - Our World will Need Charging Stations!!! $EVGO\n\n&gt;Side Bar and Quick Note -   \"Subaru opens reservations for Solterra EV and announces a charging partnership with EVgo\" - there are rumors of Exxon liking the EVGO technology and putting them in an already established Massive Infrastructure of Fossil Fuel Stations that Exxon Controls\n\nEVgo\u2019s owned and operated charging network serves over 65 metropolitan areas across 34 states. EVgo offers its services to EV drivers, business owners, policymakers, fleets and automakers.  The EV Revolution Is Here -  Shell, BP, Chevron and others are starting to embrace the notion of offering customers other options besides gasoline fill-ups in an attempt to keep access to wallets and loyalty, regardless of which type of drivetrain rolls in. ....

    "title": "\u201cF\u201d \u2013 Ford Price Target $50!!!!!, \u201cTSLA\u201d Price Target $500!!!! \u2013 SECOND UPDATE",
    "selftext": "This is the second update to my previous post. I have added two more sections. Debt and EV strategy \n\n **Debt** \n\nFord debt on their balance sheet that appears under long term debt heading is actually \u201cNOT DEBT\u201d that huge debt figure is the lending arm of Ford which essentially means:\n\n1.  Ford lends people to buy cars and people pay them interest and principal over period of agreed terms. \n\n2.  This debt is the same as banks asset where in a bank makes money on interest payments Therefore, Debt in their balance sheet is long terms loans that ford made, and best part is in the high interest rate environment Ford is going to make more money in interest payments more than ever!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **EV Strategy**\n\nFord Ev strategy is fierce and aggressive. Jim Farley understands that he needs to beat Tesla no matter what. He poached the best people from Tesla who have spent over a decade in tesla to ensure that Ford designs and builds better ev cars.  He is partnering with chip manufacturing firm Global foundries to get a better deal on chips. Surprisingly ford has partnered with Google in lot of skill building projects. It is possible that we may see a future partnership between google and ford for their EV software. Jim knows that they need a software partner to optimize their designs and builds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Previous Post** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u00b7  **Product Line**\n\nTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV\u2019s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. \n\n\u00b7  **Margins**\n\nTesla\u2019s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin \u2013 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% \n\nFord has lower margins (Gross \u2013 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that\u2019s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. \n\n\u00b7  **Valuation &amp; Market Share** \n\nThe most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford\u2019s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla\u2019s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That\u2019s changing now!! \n\nTesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that\u2019s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV\u2019s \n\n\u00b7  **Moat**\n\nTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV\u2019s and automation. With time and effort that\u2019s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV\u2019s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. \n\n\u00b7  **Marketing**\n\nTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!\n\n\u00b7  **High Interest rate Environment** \n\nWe are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. \n\n\u00b7  **Team**\n\nLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford\u2019s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer.",

    "title": "2021 Diversification beats Arrogance (Journey and commentary)",
    "selftext": "As 2021 rolled out I was, as always, cautious. I kept buying good fundamentals and editing my ideal entry price to some tech stocks I have kept an eye on. \n\n\nI had used margin to leverage myself 2-4x throughout 2020 and I knew this was risky. Compounding risk by buying risky stocks or leveraged ETFs wouldn't be wise.\n\n\nI had beaten indexing in 2020 and I made the occasional post laughing at people yelling about risk adjusted returns as if that matters. I had more gains than them and all they could do was yell about how risky it was. These are the kinds of people who would pay off a 1% mortgage because holding VTI is too risky. I would take that money into VTI and say this is not risky enough. Oh there were stories about just holding all TSLA or all [redacted] and this and that but I had made several plays on various stocks including a little TSLA and a little SPWR and I was satisfied. I continue holding gold mining stocks.\n\n\nI was at times swamped with Earnings Reports and Earnings calls but I knew one thing and one thing only. \n\n\n**\"You will not predict the future and no one else will, the best gains are made with calculated bets\"**\n\n\nSo I kept my diversification going and adjusted (especially on weeks where 20 Earnings Calls happened in 3-4 days) by ranking my picks from safe with 100% conviction on long term vision (50 years) to risky and has to be reviewed regularly. Then I caught up as I had time. By May it was obvious that I had \"missed\" a wonderful GME opportunity and of course I did. Those who had calls going into January 2021 that expired later that year probably had a chance to retire. \n\n\nWith each wild and irrational swing down I bought the dip and each wild irrational swing up I sold off some of my positions. I was leveraged so naturally I was holding far more in every stock than I could without that leverage, it was rewarding. When I wanted to take a few weeks off in the summer I did. Most weekends I do a blackout on finances and economics on Friday Close and only take a disinterested glance on Sunday evenings.\n\n\n\nWhen politics caused some of my picks to shoot up 10-20% in a week I sold off until I was just holding my long term positions as if I wasn't leveraged. With this market the volatility nearly always allows a lower entry later. Sometimes a week later. Remember I am leveraged so short term profit taking is necessary to take full advantage of what the risk affords me.\n\n\n\nWhen the market sometimes judged a guidance or a short term supply issue as a reason to sell off a stock, I reviewed the fundamentals and bought more. I am not holding stocks that don't have a great long term business model that works today, not just in theory.\n\n\n\nBy October I had decided my appetite for risk had been fulfilled and I needed to deleverage. sold off what I could and by early November I was less leveraged than I had been since April 2020. I saw the corrections and entered some tech positions that I found at comfortable prices. You know what happened next, the dip kept dipping. \n\n\nEntering 2022 I am still up on most of my positions. I have compounded gains due to the way I approached risk. I have removed some stocks from my watchlists that have been unable to adjust to our new economic reality in 2021 and their debt has expanded while their earnings have not done so well adjusted for inflation since 2019.\n\n\n**TLDR** So here I am. 'The crash is coming'. I have beat indexes. I am diversified. I have managed my risk level in a way I find comfortable. I will do it all over again this year. Some will panick or play into some wild conspiracy theories while the wise will take their money and nod.",

    "selftext": "Listen up Tards, \n\nEveryone knows interest rate hikes are right around the corner. .25% or .5% hike next month isn't going to matter in the long run. The market seems to be expecting interest rates to finish the year somewhere between 1-2%, with another couple of rate hikes in 2023. It's no secret the Fed will have trouble hitting 3% much less 4% interest rates before the start of 2024, and ultimately I don't think that will happen. The Fed can't finance it's 30Trilly debt with interest rates that high. If so, we would go full Volcker and have positive real interest rates, but cmon now let's not get ahead of ourselves. \n\nWith that out of the way, we are also starting to see a flattening of the yield curve. That coupled with the consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan coming in at 61.7 instead of the expected 67.5, the lowest it's been in 11yrs it's not looking great. If inflation eats away at your salary that can't outpace inflation you will end up buying less, and that's what we're starting to see. \n\nThis points us towards a looming recession around the corner. While no one including me knows how long that will last, the Fed won't want to go into it with near-zero interest rates. Therefore we are going to get the interest rate hike we expect, but sometime in the next 12-18 months, the Fed will have no choice but to lower them again and put the market and economy back on crack. Expect this dip to be short, and don't be the Tard who sat on the sidelines during March of 2022. Get your good deals in while they last. \n\nNow one might ask \"what's the best way to invest during a high inflationary period?\" Great question. Let's ask the professional Tard who does this for a living: Buffet. He describes companies that generate large cash flows, deep moats, have pricing power over their competitors, and software companies that don't require a lot of upfront capital to generate profits. \n\nEnter Tesla... Let's go back to inflation real quick and how auto fits into that. Used auto prices are up abt 40%ish yoy and new cars are still up in price and don't show any signs of coming back down soon. On top of that gas prices are through the roof. Month over month consumers have to do more and more mental gymanistics to go out and buy an ICE vehicle. Through this mess Tesla emerges with no demand problem in site, while they continue to outpace their own 50% delivery growth comfortably. Tesla grew deliveries 80something% yoy in the midst of a chip shortage that still did affect them. With the chip shortage hoepfully subsiding later this year, how will that afffect Tesla? On top of all this they increased their gross margins throughout last year. This is the pricing power you want a company to have in a high inflationary environment. Also, now for the most devisive part sorounding Tesla: fsd beta. While I don't think beta will be necarsily better than a human by the end of the year, I think were a lot closer than most expect. Fsd beta revenue will be pure profit to Tesla's bototm line, which is what you want during inflation. \n\nBuT tEsLa'S pE iS 180! Well I believe Tesla will prob do abt 12$ in eps this year at a minimum which equates to a PE ratio a little over 70 at todays price. How does that number change when a comapny continues to grow it's earnigns at 50+% a year? Tesla is dirt cheap if your investing horizon is longer than 5yrs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: Fed can't raise rates for long with a recession aroudn the corner, and with inflation showing no signs of slowing you must invest in productive companies with strong balance sheets, pricing power, and deep moats. \n\nPosistions: TSLA",

    "title": "Joby aviation (or the air Tesla)",
    "selftext": "**TLDR**: \n\n$JOBY is an electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) aircraft company that will provide hub-to-hub travel ~2026. eVTOLs are the love child of airplanes and helicopters and bring together the best of both because they\u2019re cheap, fast, and convenient. In the eVTOL space, $JOBY has the best tech, hands down. They will be first to mass market, and accessible to most people. Current share price is ~$6.00 at $3.6B valuation but an appropriate price target is $70/share by 2024. Read below. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to, watch this video [2:29]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itP8-3j2UZI\n\n**Background**\n\nImagine you\u2019re in DC and want to get to Philly. It\u2019s a 2.5 hour drive because it\u2019s too short of a distance to fly conventionally. But &gt;current year 2026 so what you actually do is you book a flight with Joby through Uber. You head to the nearest parking garage, wait for your ride, and get there in under an hour. All for under $100. That\u2019s what Joby is promising. \n\nThis is all possible because of tech that surpasses that of any other eVTOL competitors such as Lillium, Ehang, Volvcopter, Archer, etc. The key innovations are 1) reducing noise and 2) increasing safety. Background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nbz5VFilxY\n\nThe bigger obstacle is noise, not safety. Joby has to prove that its presence isn\u2019t going to impact you if you\u2019re not a customer. Alice and Bob don\u2019t want to hear teeth-rattling helicopters at 7:00AM picking up the neighborhood\u2019s multi-millionaire for work. End of story. Joby addresses this problem with new prop technology that is a LOT quieter. Listen for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itP8-3j2UZI This is the coolest thing about Joby, by far.\n\nThen safety. You have to make sure that the people that are using your service feel safe. In the 80s and 90s, cities banned helicopters because of safety concerns, specifically because of fatal  helicopter accidents. But the S4 (the name of the aircraft) is a technological and engineering masterpiece. It\u2019s extremely safe and reliable with layers and layers of redundancy. Each propeller is powered by two motors, each with their own inverter. There are two power sources, in case one fails, and three flight computers. You don\u2019t even need all six props to fly. If all goes to hell, the S4 can glide like a plane, because it has wings. You can expect Joby to make this fact known prior to commercial operations. People will feel safe.\n\n**All this is nice, but do the numbers work? Take the following with a grain of salt:**\n\nLet\u2019s be really generous and assume that every trip takes 4 passengers (full capacity), each of whom are charged approximately $3 per mile flown (target goal). Assume that each trip is 25 miles and takes 15 mins with a 5 min turnaround, so Joby is able to make 3 trips an hour. Assume 24/7 operation, like any other airline. That\u2019s (3 * 25 * 4 * 3 * 24 * 7 * 365) = $55.18 Million in revenue a year, per aircraft. Even if Joby operated with 3% efficiency, that\u2019s still $1.6M in revenue per aircraft per year.\n\n$1.6M annually per aircraft is a conservative estimate that is in line with other analysts. Morgan Stanley expects 300 aircraft to provide $500 Million in revenue which works out the same. With that in mind MS has established a price target of $21 with 3x potential from there (seeking alpha link banned) The original price target was $16: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/joby-stock-higher-morgan-stanley-initiates-overweight My estimate is slightly north of Morgan Stanley\u2019s at $70, taking into account applications not just for commuting (I elaborate below). \n\n**Timeline**\n\nA couple things stand in the way of commercial operation: 1) An air carrier certificate (in order to act as an \u2018airline\u2019) 2) An aircraft type certificate (what kind of aircraft is Joby?) and 3) Pilots. This Part 23/Part 135 stuff is really specific aviation stuff. You can read more about it here:\nhttps://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/july/29/joby-moves-on-part-135-certificate But it\u2019s essentially regulation about which regulation should apply to Joby\u2019s S4s since the airframe is so different than anything before it. \n\nBy far,  the FAA is the biggest unknown prerevenue and the most likely to affect share price in the short term. I have no doubt that Joby will become a commercial success once the FAA gives the green light. Until then, approvals and delays from the FAA will have the biggest impact on the stock. Good news is that everything is on track as of now i.e. 2024 commercial operations. \n\n**Commercial operations never come. Is it over?**\n\nWell, I think it\u2019s unlikely that commercial operations don\u2019t ever come. Joby has been working on passenger transport since 2009 and could have bailed far earlier if that was a bad business model. Furthermore, Joby isn\u2019t planning to launch in just the United States, but also in South Korea and Japan. That\u2019s what sent Joby\u2019s stock soaring this/last week, despite the market being wonked. That is diversification of revenues and risk and is really good for Joby\u2019s long term health.\n\n$JOBY + SKT: https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/06/joby-aviation-to-launch-air-taxi-service-in-south-korea/\n\n$JOBY + ANA: https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Transportation/Flying-car-startup-Joby-lands-partnership-with-Japan-s-ANA\n\nEven if commercial operations commuting really get sidelined, it\u2019s not completely over.\n\nJoby\u2019s aircraft can still be used for tourism, cargo transport, search and rescue, and military applications - especially military applications. The USAF has certified Joby's and I expect orders to come. The S4 is ideal for personnel and cargo transport over short distances. There are probably other applications as well\u2026\n\n**The valuation**\n\nAll this leads to the most important question, really. What is Joby\u2019s fair price? Why is Joby sitting at $6.00/share and a $3.6B valuation when it has so much potential? It comes down to market mechanics and risk.\n\nDespite all the potential Joby has, it is still a prerevenue company. And in all fairness, the risks to the timeline of commercial launch are considerable. That makes $JOBY a speculative investment, and with that comes a bunch of baggage. \n\nBecause of how institutional investment works, a lot of fund prospectuses (the rules of investing for a particular fund) do not allow speculative investments. Without the steady inflow of institutional capital, Joby\u2019s share price is simply going to see a lot of volatility, as trading is mainly driven by arbitrageurs, insiders, day traders, retail, hedge funds, and other speculators that aren\u2019t holding Joby for long time frames. \n\nAlso, Joby is simply under the radar (ha). Not a lot of people know about it or its potential yet (just like Netflix in 2008, Moderna in 2019, and IONQ today). JOBY is going to see the same volatility in its early days like big names today, e.g. TSLA.\n\nBut one day out of the blue, JOBY will have a stellar quarterly/annual report that will establish fundamentals and catapult it into the limelight, at which it\u2019s valuation will simply balloon. Share price will appreciate the most at this moment when JOBY has proven itself to both investors and speculators.\n\n**How to play this?**\n\nCarefully. Because of some of the risks associated with the timeline, I\u2019d be careful about anything with an expiration date. With stock so cheap right now, there\u2019s little reason to hold options over stock. However, I\u2019m also not blind to the fact that JOBY might suddenly pop x10 when people realize what a gem it is. That\u2019s why I have some Jan 23s sprinkled in. But you do you. This is not financial advice. \n\n**Other**\nI\u2019m pretty bullish on JOBY but you should balance your diet with other takes.\n\nAVweb (gold standard for aviation content): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a717YZnhQ-s\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmDxLahdiGk\n\nBrian Feroldi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulv0-Ro628o\n\nFundamentals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaaPGYosGMM\n\nDisclosures\n\n^^I'm ^^not ^^a ^^financial ^^analyst. ^^Also ^^I'm ^^kinda ^^dumb.\n\n^^My ^^positions:\n\n^^$1,001 ^^- ^^$15,000 ^^long ^^stock\n\n^^$1,001 ^^- ^^$15,000 ^^long ^^Jan ^^23 ^^calls",

This gives the market enough time to slowly bleed and adjust to interest rate hikes, war nonsense, inflation, and balance sheet reduction.  \n\n\n# 2 Catalysts\n\n Everyone says \"But stonks only go up\", \"These are down %50-%70 from ATH\". I am not looking at companies like $PYPL, $SQ which have fundamentals and make money. I am looking at companies that have no free cash flow, bad technicals, and make no money. Some of these have already came down a lot, but they have a long ways to go. With interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction it will be extremely difficult for overvalued companies to get bonds and loans to increase their production or operations. How might this affect bigger companies that are not neccessarily overvalued, rather, blue chip growth stocks like GOOG and AAPL. They will certainly go down in the next 6 months to 1 year but will recover and hit more ATH in the near future. So stop buying puts on big tech and wondering why they won't react as bad as some others.   \n\n\n# 3 The Play\n\n**Lucid Motors, Rivian, Draft Kings, Beyond Meat are all trash can water and belong behind Wendy's with the rest of you retards buying OTM 0DTE on margin**  \n\n\nHow the hell is LCID a 20 billion dollar company, Rivian twice that size, and how is Beyond Meat still a public company.   \n\n\nTo the people who say they made bank 2020-2021 on these, congrats your calls printed but we are moving on with this rotation. There will not be anymore meme relevance or squeezes for these stocks. Look at how much they have already came down from ATH. There is so much more room to go down, it is obvious these can EASILY decrease %50 more. Remember when [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) was public and going crazy in 1999? Yeah it got delisted after the first bubble pop. THIS IS EXACLTY what is going to happen to some of these companies this year, and people cannot fathom how it will happen, because it will happen when we are not ready for it  \n\n\n# 4 The bubble\n\n It is clear stocks are in a massive bubble based on their Price to Sale (P/S valuation). \n\nWarren Buffett  stated that his favorite means of valuing stock was the stock market capitalization to GDP ratio.\n\nBelow is a chart for this metric. As you can see, the stock market today is as overvalued relative to the economy as it was at the peak of the 1999 Tech Mania.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0pvdtigpmj81.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376c74db877985f3878fab9ad2081981abc07816\n\n So stocks are overvalued based on the most reliable corporate data point (revenues) and they are also overvalued relative to the economy. Scratch that, they're not overvalued... they're **trading at 1999-Tech Bubble insanity levels**. \n\nThis time the FED has created a **bubble in everything**. A \"risk-free rate\" of return against which ALL risk assets are valued. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparing to 1999 tech bubble, 2008 housing market bubble, this will be considered the 2022 Digitial Currency/EV bubble. Look at the 10-20 year charts for any automotive company. It is not pretty. So what makes Rivian and LCID worth more than GM or Toyota? Nothing, since its a bubble. I will rule out Tesla on this one since we know damn well they make money, have an incredible CEO, and produce something tangible unlike these others. Tesla is still overvalued and it will go down with the digital currency/ev crash, but most likely not as hard as other competitors.   \n\n\n# 5 Short Bull thesis counterargument\n\n*\"What if it takes 3 more years to crash these sectors? Look at Tesla in 2016, 2017, 2018 retard, you thought it was overvalued then, look how high it is now.\"*   \nGood point, but that's what a bubble is, and the government allowed companies to become overvalued by constantly printing money and rising inflation since before the pandemic so stocks could only go up and create this bubble we are currently in.   \n\n\n*\"How can you be so sure these will keep dropping?\"*  \nA stock can never hit 0 but can become pennies. Look at WISH, CLOV, and those aren't even penny stocks yet, or delisted, but a lot lower from what their overvalued price was WITHOUT interest rate hikes, and balance sheet reduction. We can be sure many of these will be delisted or go to single digits. I will explain which ones below  \n\n\n6 Positions  \nMostly playing monthly to year puts to reduce Theta decay and try to let them expire when the market will most likely feel the change the most. Trying to not go so far OTM in case we see more short-term bull runs, as often these occur in bear markets as well. Tesla is more of a gamble since 250 seems incredibly unlikely, but so did most of the stocks in 2000 (DELL $60 to $2)  \n\n\n**4-6 months out:**\n\nRIVN June 17 2022 40P  \nLCID June 17 2022 20P  \nBYND June 17 40P\n\n**Longer dates**  \n\n\nLCID Jan 20 2023 10P, 12.5P   \nLICD Jan 19 2024 10P  \nRIVN Jan 20 2023 30P  \nRIVN Jan 19 2024 30P  \nTSLA Jan 19 2024 250P  \nBYND Jan 20 2023, 30P",

    "title": "Never thought I'd say this, but I think TSLA's share price is actually fairly valued right now",
    "selftext": "I see myself as a value investor, so not a full on gay bear, but still if anything bi. I always laughed at TSLA's ludicrously high valuation, chalking it up to hype and meme power. I swore I'd never go near it.\n\nBut after taking a long hard look at the numbers, I think for the first time TSLA's share price actually makes sense. For 2021 they delivered 920,000 vehicles, up from 500,000 the year before. This translates to roughly $5 per share with a net margin of 10%. They're expected to deliver around 1.4 million vehicles in 2022., which would be around $8-$9 per share. \n\nNow the big question, how much/long can they continue growing into the future? Honestly, the demand for TSLA vehicles is there. This is evident by used Teslas selling at a slight premium to new vehicles because people don't want to have to wait six months. That's really bullish. It means TSLA's main bottleneck is production/supply chain issues, not demand. Likely they can increase sales by 5-700,000 units per year for at least the next 5-10 years. They'd need to open a new factory once a year on average in order to achieve this.\n\nLet's say in 5 years TSLA does 4 million deliveries. That translates to around $30 per share. If they can ever get to 10 million, hopefully in 10 years, then we're looking at like $65-$70 per share. And this is only from their auto business. Software, self-driving, insurance, batteries, charging stations are all other reasons to be bullish on the stock. \n\nI used to believe that as time goes on, other auto companies would eventually catch up to TSLA and take their market share. To some extent this might be true, however there's reason to believe the legacy autos won't ever be much of a threat. In addition to brand loyalty and widespread recognition as thee EV auto company, TSLA is at least 4-5 years ahead of the other guys in terms of tech and continues to innovate. That's a pretty wide lead. And even if in the next decade or two if TSLA does lose their tech lead, that's a far cry from meaning they'll lose popularity.\n\nI think the current situation is very comparable to Apple. Apple was the first to make a cool, sexy smart phone with a bunch of new features. But nowadays there's almost nothing any other generic brand smartphone can't do that the iphone can. And yet, people still pay high premiums for iphones purely because of the brand, all stemming from the first mover advantage. I think this is exactly like TSLA.\n\nNow it's difficult/impossible to put a price target or present fair value on a company with as many unknowns and as high a growth rate as TSLA. But if they can eventually get to 10 million deliveries in the next 10 - 15 years, then that's already 65-$70 of earnings per share, plus all the other possibilities outside of their auto business. $750 seems like a fair price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart of me wishes I bought in sooner ofc lmao, but hindsight is always 20/20. I definitely still believe TSLA was never a buy until today, or except maybe in April 2020. Buying during 2017-2019 was a complete gamble/speculation, don't even try to argue this point lmao. There was always a chance TSLA would end up being the wild success it's looking like it's becoming now, but that was far from certain. Much more likely bankrupt or several more years before reaching this point.  \n\n2020-2021 TSLA was starting to look very legit, however the share price was always way ahead of where the company actually was at. But currently, the share price hasn't moved in the last year (well actually it's moved a lot lmao, but you know what I mean). And it's trading at the lower end of where it was in 2021. Meanwhile, during 2021, TSLA made significant progress in the actualization of their business. Everything humming along nicely despite any challenges. So that is why I'm a TSLA bull for the first time as of yesterday.\n\nI bought 10% of my total money set aside for a TSLA position yesterday at $790. Looks like I'll have a chance to double down today and pick up another 10% at 720-ish. I hope we get to see $500 in the next few weeks, that's probably when I'll move all in.\n\nTLDR; TSLA not overvalued and actually reasonably priced as of today.",

Just for the mere fact that they have a window open to do so. Basically at this point, if the west doesn\u2019t, then China will assume that their economic ties are a stronghold to the west (since Russia oil and gas are strongholds) where thr EU and US can\u2019t really do anything significant.\n\nSo the next question would be, how would we punish China. Well you can\u2019t, and the weakness in punishing Russia is reverberating.\n\nI think in all likelihood, EU and US need to do something drastic like turn of oil and gas, or remove Russia from swift.  If they don\u2019t, it\u2019ll cause a way messier situation for everyone. China needs to know that their economic prowess in cheap labour can be turned off causing their billion people population to rise up quickly.\n\nThis is the only play, and I\u2019m surprised US and EU are playing nice to save a few million Europeans (not saying that they shouldn\u2019t be saved, just the cost of not doing a strong punitive action will be much higher and still will impact the millions they are trying to save now)\n\nFYI some posters below (just like when posts about Russia possibly will invade) are posting \u201cxyz does this all the time\u201d.

    "selftext": "Man, I'm exhausted. I spent the whole week at the casino, played earnings almost every day.\n\nI have a newborn coming soon (Mar 24th) and needed some extra cash, its been a good month for me so far, from 13k to 37k I can't complain, considering a lot of people are down. Now i can sit back a bit and just focus on my kid coming. \n\nMy idea this week was to sell calls, with the war going, good earnings would be mute. I got nervous with TSLA and COST so those percentages are lower because I exited those positions early.\n\n[Postions ](https://imgur.com/a/B1F0VWb)\n\nBetter image of plays! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f61zsCauD81fu4LeisOTK6QQUpZmZ3ZtoMrhLHHDJFM/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nMonday- $ZM (Zoom) - A pretty easy one to start with, all the covid beauties have been selling off. \u00a0It was trading around $132, I opened the position later in the day 15mins before closing. almost 30% otm just in case!\n\n\nTuesday-$CRM (Salesforce)- I had the same feeling with this one, sell calls. It was trading around $210, I went out about 15%. It did pop about $10 from $210 to $220 but the IV crush just killed this. I could have bought it back for ($0.01) but I was always told to leave a little meat on the bone if you want to REALLY want to get it filled, so I just went with ($0.05).(Same with ZOOM)\n\n\nWednesday- $TLSA (Tesla) I was in and out of this trade in one day. I thought I would play it safe have 2 good wins Mon and Tuesday, to just play out tesla the rest of the week, but I got nervous about the JPOW meeting and got out early morning. Easily would have been a winner if I held as well, but glad I opted for more plays! I GOT GREEDY!\n\n\nThursday- $SNOW (Snowflake) Tech company that isn't making money right now, People are exhausted and just didn't want to keep waiting on this company to start turning around, also heard they were cut off from SWIFT as well, never looked into it, just rumor. It was trading around $265 went about $45 out or 17% out, and opened the position with 15mins left in the day. MY BEST WIN! I ALMOST WENT ALL IN on $220 puts! That would have been a good 4-5x!\n\n\nFriday- $COST (Costco) I was looking at calls all day, but the value wasn't there, I almost just skipped this play and said I did good, just stop. But I'm an addict. This is the only play I did puts with, Stupid I know. I honestly thought I would go down, but not by much after a nice gap up from earnings, but it tanked a bit, I was able to get out right at the bell, put some limit orders in and they filled. I thought it would get the same love as Kroger did but I got a little win from the IV crush.\n\nThose were my plays for this week $7k. I know these were all risky as fuck, but that's why we are here! Have a Great Weekend all! Daddies have steak tonight!",

    "title": "Amazon stock has its second-best day of 2022 on planned 20-for-1 split",
    "selftext": " Amazon shares bucked a down day for the market, rallying more than 5% after the company announced a 20-for-1 [stock split](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/amazon-announces-20-for-1-stock-split-10-billion-buyback.html) and said it will buy back up to $10 billion worth of additional stock.\n\nIt was the second-best day of the year for Amazon, which jumped 14% on Feb. 4, after an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings report. The stock closed at $2936.35 on Thursday.\n\nStock splits don\u2019t change a company\u2019s fundamental prospects, but they lower the price of each share, potentially attracting a wider swath of investors. In Amazon\u2019s case, reducing the share price by 95% could make the company a contender for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which weights its 30 components by stock price rather than by market cap.\n\nWere the split to happen as of Wednesday\u2019s close, the cost of each share would go from $2,785.58 to $139.28, and each existing holder would get 19 additional shares for every one they own. Amazon would have the 12th-smallest weighing among Dow stocks, which would put it in the middle of the pack, right alongside Walmart.\n\n\u201cWe believe AMZN is one of the biggest companies with a clear pulse on the American economy and not included in the Dow Jones Top 30 Index,\u201d wrote Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst at MKM Partners, in a note to clients after the announcement. He recommends buying the stock.\n\nAmazon is the latest highly valued tech company to pull down the price of each share through a split. Google parent\u00a0Alphabet announced\u00a0a 20-for-1 split in February. In mid-2020,\u00a0Apple\u00a0disclosed plans for a 4-for-1 split, and\u00a0[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA)\u00a0told investors it was instituting a 5-for-1 split.\n\nFor CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos in July, the split and buyback could be aimed at appeasing shareholders, who have had a rough stretch of late. Amazon was the [worst performer](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/amazon-was-the-worst-performing-faang-stock-of-2021-heres-why.html) among U.S. Big Tech stocks last year, and the shares were down 16% in 2022 prior to the announcement.\n\nAmazon said the change is also targeted at helping corporate staffers.\n\n\u201cThis split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nDistributions from the stock split will be made to shareholders at the close of business on June 3, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 6.\n\nThis is\u00a0Amazon\u2019s fourth stock split since its IPO in 1997, and its first since 1999, when the company was a fraction of its current size. It also split on a 2-for-1 basis on June 2, 1998; a 3-for-1 basis on Jan. 5, 1999; and a 2-for-1 basis on Sept. 2, 1999.\n\nAmazon\u00a0shares are up more than 4,300% since the last split was announced.\n\n [Amazon stock has second-best day of 2022 on planned 20-for-1 split (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/amazon-stock-has-second-best-day-of-2022-on-planned-20-for-1-split.html)",

    "selftext": "Hello my fellow \ud83e\udd8d apes and skeptics. Following up from my post the other day about how we were entering into \ud83d\udc3b market territory and for everyone to try and stay calm and mitigate as much loss as possible. Spy hit a new low of $414 the other day after opening down and then a mid-day Brandon speech rally that shortly came to a crush back down because sleepy Joe forgot to wakeup on time. Market volatility at its finest, shorts covering? Or just a technical bounce from the recent drops? Volume in the market appears to be low as retail and hedgies battle it out to try to make a quick buck. Big money is still likely in bonds, gold or cash gang watching the madness unfold waiting for their opportunity to buy in cheaply once everyone gets flushed out. \n\nSo what\u2019s next? Oil plays will likely still pan out for the next few weeks but if you didn\u2019t make positions in oil by now its best to wait and watch as oil becomes overextended in price ($150 - $200 gallon) and short it back to reality ($75/gallon). I don\u2019t actually short stocks but buying puts and inverse ETFs i do enjoy feeding my \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b urges. \n\nPositions I will be taking close to the end of march if oil keeps pumping: \n\nCALLS AND CALLS on $SCO. Maybe even DCA into some shares around $5 and under. 52 week low was hit today around $4.88 and these gas prices is too good to be sustainable, thus making a great opportunity with more research to short, puts, inverse oil. Made good returns on sco calls yesterday. \n\nMy uvxy, chpt, xle, qqq puts all panned out extremely well as defense stocks gave up some gains. \n\nI still believe SPY could hit a low of $360 - $390 , with first entry to go long around $380 since we can\u2019t time this and no one knows where the bottom could be. If spy doesn\u2019t reach sub $400 this year then who cares because i rather be patient and be wrong than be greedy and losing money. I will however make some nice swing and day trades if spy nears $400 floor. \n\nEV plays like chpt, tsla could keep doing well as i see chpt going to near $20 again soon, so I\u2019m still holding my calls which were clearly cheap af compared to tsla because i ain\u2019t Warren Buffet rich (yet). \n\nAdd on: Start making positions in cyber companies as this has been a big topic past few months and even Google acquired a multi-billion dollar cyber company. I personally like $NET near $100 or less and Crowdstrike as my cyber related plays. Im sure theres more but I don\u2019t know them well enough to park money there. \n\nFinal thoughts: always hedge your bets and option straddles are fantastic for volatile markets.\nMetals, commodities, bonds, fertilizer stocks, WEAT are also great plays to add to if they dip. Just don\u2019t chase and monitor closely since these intraday \u201csee-saw\u201d like market movements are a pain in my a$$",

His rosacea beams when he talks about them, his voice booming with an authority that makes FOMO unavoidable. I found him last Saturday where he usually is in Sapphire (Times Square location). He wanted to talk about his investment newsletter he\u2019s about to start putting out while a piece of Cuban meat ground expertly on him, contaminating our space with what I learned was an essence called *Warm Vanilla*, by Bath &amp; Body Works. I pressed him on which EV to short and how to do it. He slapped the Cuban\u2019s ass and instantly appeared an enormous square-shaped bouncer from the shadow warning him. Normally this will get you thrown out, but he greases the place like the lesser Biden did Ukraine. Anyway, my friend became functional, getting his shit under control and staring at me. This was rare though, as he can hardly maintain eye contact. But it was dark enough, and he gets Bolivian marching powder from the same cats that sell to the anorexic towers overlooking Central Park, the half empty ones owned by a dozen shells working back to a czar colluding to replace Putin before he\u2019s Grand Dragon of Finland and Arch Duke of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYou sell a call at strike price A,\u201d he said, \u201cThen you buy a put at strike price A.\u201d\n\nI thought about it a moment. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the equivalent of just shorting the stock?\u201d\n\nHe laughed at me but was staring in the Cuban\u2019s eyes now. \u201cThe margin requirement is far less, way less.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amazing when stupid simple things like that get overlooked. With this strategy I can short RIDE to bankruptcy which will happen later this year and have enough money for violent YOLO\u2019s as circumstances demand in what\u2019s certain to be a volatile trader\u2019s market. The autist explained the importance of lasers in the manufacture of semiconductors and modern batteries. He took a veiled shot at me claiming I\u2019m familiar with neon at the liquor store I frequent, but neon gas is necessary for these lasers. He says Ukraine effectively exports all the world\u2019s neon for these, and with the conflict, it\u2019s pretty much over without Obama-style bailouts with Trump-sized denials. He calls shorting these EV\u2019s a millionaire maker and that they\u2019ve already enjoyed their stonk and meme gasps.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for them to get undressed by the buzzards.\u201d\n\nThe FOMO this guy writes into me is like the bank robbery scene in the movie Heat. But suddenly the meat spoke, she said something interesting while we were briefly talking about Russia, her pleasing boobs rattling with each syllable:\n\n\u201cCubans don\u2019t want their grandpa\u2019s revolution, they want jobs. Putin no understand generational divide. Nobody cares about or wants their parent\u2019s Soviet Union. Is gone. Culture change. World change. Globalization. Interdependent...\u201d\n\nThe lecherous Patrick Bateman inside us all would\u2019ve paid anything to smash this meat and leave it for dead. Trust me. Anything at all. NYC strippers are amazing, smart, cognizant creatures. Someday I want to get a list of all the old Harvey Weinstein haunts and try figuring out if they had anything to do with him shafting Saving Private Ryan from getting best picture in 1999. Anyway, knowing I\u2019d be looking to make up for blue balls with another dancer in the Sapphire\u2019s employ, I quickly left. I rode my bike back to Brooklyn, and in my apartment searched r/wallstreetbets for anyone of the same mind as my autist. All I found were degen bulls buying calls and refusing to admit they\u2019re trying to make up for missing out on TSLA.",

However, Robinhood shows that due to wash sales, I made 21k.\n\nIs it possible to pay taxes even if I'm losing money overall? I read that I can use tax harvesting so I can use 3k to offset these losses until I'm cleared. I know I became extra retarded in the name of greed so I would like to know how you can mitigate this.\n\nThis year I started off at 160k and now I'm sitting at ..... 71k (I'm numb and can't feel pain anymore) and I'm sure I'm falling under wash sales again because I bought same SPY/QQQ/TSLA etc. contracts multiple times and ended up losing even more money.

    "selftext": "I get it, covid was officially over after the Ukraine crisis started, but not in China. Somehow their recent movements towards full lockdowns again have gone unnoticed by world media in light of recent events. Today, Xi put Shenzen on full lockdown. For those unfamiliar, Shenzen is pretty much a semiconductor mecca. Every technology company from all parts of the world produces there and it going down is no bueno for those growth forecasts in the short to medium term. Moreover, this step will likely extrapolate to all of chinas production in short-term extreme shutdowns that will have reverberations on already stressed supply lines. This is all in addition to their housing market fucking imploding the implications of which are still unknown. \n\nMy opinion/positions:\n\nIt is of my thought that the T-word will be greatly affected by the significant shutdown in China, a majority(all) of its profitability relies on Chinese production. If this shutdown is significant it will significantly hurt its short-term growth numbers as this bubble bursts into a recession.\n\nTSLA 240119P00200\n\nTSLA 240119P00150\n\nEdit:\n\nIn addition, I would like to add there are certain geopolitical uncertainties that recently have arisen out of Ukraine scenario.

I believe in investing for the long term and i will keep doing so.\n\nBut I can't be totally blind to reality: growing inflation, growing interest rates, a war in Europe, and an energy cost shock coming on us. We are likely in for a quarter or two of negative growth. If the war goes on for longer, it might well be more.\n\nI can't imagine this will not impact the markets, particularly as I am heavily invested in more volatile shares (TSLA, NVDA, AMD, QQQ, AMZN, GOOGL to name a few). I also have a Lombard account, which is on the safe side for now, but you never know how things go.\n\nI have made some (limited) adjustments to my portfolio meant to reduce my Lombard. I am now in a situation where I would risk a margin call only if things were to go massively tits up (as in, say,: Nasdaq minus 60% or 70%, or a combination of Nasdaq minus 50% and S&amp;P minus 50%). I am using this as a proxy of general shares decline, if the indices go down badly there's is no way TSLA or NVDA will escape the carnage, though they might fare... less badly (or not, as the case may be).\n\nI know this is, realistically, unlikely, which is why I sleep at night. But I would like to know what your opinions are on a slow, steady, protracted decline like the one in the years 1929 to 1931 (which was way more brutal than the October 1929 crash). I am particularly interested in the risk approach of those who already have a Lombard account and must, I think, make the same considerations I am making.\n\nThanks to all retards in advance",

This is my first real post/discussion and most likely my last. As you can see in the two images, I am a shit investor. The trades that brought me low date back almost 7 years and I have never been green except for maybe my first trade ever for a split second. Today was supposed to be the day I was to get back on track towards turning my account green, but I failed at that as well.\n\nAs you can see, my losses have really accelerated in the past few months but they really began in earnest with TSLA back in 2017. I bought TSLA at $320 (pre-split) right before ER and rode it down for the next 3 months until it hit $180. After suffering through that, the first green day afterwards I sold all 500 shares for $194 or so. Cue Clown music as TSLA soared past my buy in and beyond within a few months. Then the next significant loss was on NCLH, which I bought in Feb2020 for $50 a share right before Covid. I suffered through that trade though the Covid Crash and diamond handed it all the way down to $7 a share and sold it at $12 and didn't look back. So at this point, I started trading volatility AND options like an idiot after seeing TVIX go from $20 to $1000 in a few weeks. Which did not work out either. Then I read about UVXY and began buying puts on it when it spikes, which actually worked for a while, but I got greedy and wanted more gains, so instead of buying longer dated puts for more time, I began playing short dated puts, which was a complete mistake.\n\nAfter blowing up most of my account trying to be a permabull last SeptemBear, I noticed a funny quirk of UVXY on Quad Witching and the Monday afterwards. If you purchase short dated UVXY calls at the bottom on the Thursday before Quad Witching, which usually occurred around 1430. There was consistently a pop in UVXY (due to Vix Futures) the morning of Quad Witching, and an even bigger spike the Monday following. Now I did my \"research\", which consisted of examining the price action for every Quad Witching (SPY, UVXY, and VIX Futures) from 2006-2021 and I discovered that there was consistently a pop in UVXY on both days. Although there was a couple of outliers on the March 2020 and 2021 Quad Witchings, which I will discuss below.\n\nSo when Dec2021 Quad Witching rolled around, I was prepared to take advantage of this price action. Unfortunately, the Dec2021 Quad witching did not behave exactly like the Sep2021 Quad Witching, so I was caught off guard when UVXY dipped to $14.08 at the open for like 5 minutes, and then mooned on me for the rest of the day. That was not the price action that I was expecting, so I wasn't able to grab the 1k $14 call contracts that I was aiming for. So I watched all this happen and it shot up to $16.82 that day and then mooned to $19 the following Monday right on schedule. I didn't buy in and watched all of this in disgust. So fast forward to yesterday, although the setup was different, UVXY behaved exactly like it did in September, so I went all in on $16.50 UVXY Calls expiring today, which I actually sold at the open today for break even. The problem is that I then FOMO'ed into $17 and $18 UVXY calls expiring next Friday, for the Monday pop.\n\nSo as we all know, SPY did not drill today as it has for the past 3 Quad Witchings and mooned like no tomorrow. So my UVXY calls bled out to practically nothing today and brought my account to the shambles that you see below. I don't actually know what I am going to do. I have now lost half a million dollars of my retirement and life savings. I have a pension, so I am fine for money, but I would like to get back even some day, but I don't even know if that is possible at this point. When I see posts like the ape that went from 17K to 75K to 600K on Amazon calls, I get hope, but I have never made a trade that successful before, so I don't even know how to go about it. When I try Amazon or TSLA calls, I just get fucked.\n\nWell, thanks for reading my shitty trader;s story. Hopefully this can be a lesson to someone to not day trade and don't ever try options. Although, to be frank, I was doing terrible even before I discovered options but they just made it just infinitely worse. This has been really cathartic. Have a good day.

    "selftext": "    Doing my research I feel confident that with everything going on regarding more heavy minded tensions regarding war and increased prices, prices will tighten at the 100$ a barrel and then just as everyone thinks oils headed to 150 or 160 it drops to a permanent 90, 80, high 70\u2019s into a hopeful 60\u2019s coming into 2023.\n\n  it is not only an increase to the economical situation Covid brought but a way to boost economies on a global scale. Regarding Biden, I feel a poorly handed pandemic, war, increase in prices, taxes and rates across the board is a terrible look. With my research done, I discovered Oil companies based in the U.S. have stockpiled hundreds of permits prior to Biden becoming president. \n    \n  With all the insider garbage, lies and disregard for basic decency oil is at a point of, okay, this is where it\u2019s at. The Limbo Affect that war has especially a war so heavily revolved around oil and natural resources brings note to new highs and new high lows. \n\n Basically here\u2019s what i\u2019m thinking. \n\n   As resources from food to water to housing to oil have their moment to shine in the economy, they are based in a timely fashion. Warren Buffett the gayest man alive, has taken a massive position in an American oil company. What do I think this means? \n\n  Once oil reaches a point of semi permanent \u201cthis is where we\u2019re at\u201d the tides will suddenly change and America will begin producing oil out of its ass and getting help from neighbors, suddenly gas prices change, crude oil drops and the majority of crayon eaters are left eating the box while the rich stay rich. \n\nInstead of investing into oil cus manipulation is rampant and I can\u2019t do options to save my life in this bear market, I believe DRIP has more in store for us yet again. \n\nPositions: 500 shares of DRIP at 2.82\n\nDRIP has a reverse split of 10-1 coming into affect on March 28th, reverse splits often bring fear but they also bring growth. Doing the math, it is set up beautifully with American oil companies sweeping the rug under most investors feet and will perform extraordinarily as energy and oil stocks go back and forth, this would be the middle play. \n\nIn Simple Terms\n\n Buy Drip on the Dip as it prepares to split \n               Profit off the growth \n           Buy more Drip with profit\nPost split experiences massive growth as American Oil takes over in the upcoming months, take final profit and move on with gains \n Buy ur wife\u2019s boyfriend an exquisite new head board and bed frame so they stop making so much noise while you try to do DD\u2019s on TSLA",

    "title": "SPY and TSLA Callapalooza",
    "selftext": "\nSup freaks. Its me again, the only guy left on this piece of shit forum that still posts some trades BEFORE it\u2019s too late to get in on them.\n\nThis one is easy as fuck. Buy some SPY calls. Attached are my positions. All 2069 of them. Thats right I\u2019ve got 2000 SPY calls and 69 TSLA calls (that I purchased this week).\nHere\u2019s why you should follow me.\n\n1. The rate hike is in. Its a beautiful quarter point raise, Jpow hinted that the rest will be quarter points as well and the market loves it.\n\n2. Ukraine conflict has been fully priced in. Putin\u2019s midlife crisis has hopefully come to a head and the sanctions being imposed have definitely shook him and his boys up. Its also made China realize the cost of doing war in a fully globalized economy. Barring any major escalations from Putin, the market will continue its uptrend.\n\n3. The global economy is sizzling hot. Metrics from almost every sector are putting up great numbers, unemployment is at all time lows, we are seeing the final exit from the covid economy. The last lagging effect is supply chain issues. Which brings us nicely to my next point.\n\n4. Inflation is actually transitory and not as bad as the numbers suggest. Most of the inflation we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t because of all the money we printed. Its because of heavy demand coupled with supply side hiccups and hangovers from covid. Its known as cost push inflation. So all the urchins out there trying to peddle some crap about hyperinflation and weimar republic are just abusing your pea brain for clicks. However inflation will most likely remain high for some time while the fed reigns it in. So if inflation persists but the economy is hot\u2026. What should you do with your money?\n\n5. Buy the dip ******. Stop trying to be fancy with grandma\u2019s death money or your shitty kid\u2019s community college fund. I don\u2019t know where you retards are getting some of these awful plays that I see in the loss porn. Maybe TikTok? Treat yourself to some tasty SPY calls, or if you\u2019re feeling frisky, TSLA calls. Everything is pricey right now due to all the volatility, but calls are cheap relatively and in my opinion dirt cheap if you believe that the market is moving up hard. Pretty much everything is going to rip and soon. I\u2019m already up roughly 200k on my positions but they\u2019ve got plenty or room to run. This week was most likely the bottom and beginning of the rip, but you haven\u2019t missed out.\n\nMy final speculation is that not only are we going to see green, but the market will retrace back up to our previous ATHs scarily fast. \n\nTL;DR\nMonday was the bottom, buy the dip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[positions](https://i.imgur.com/mpQcgoe_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)",

    "selftext": "Ten months ago, u/robertisaak proposed, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naehn4/south_park_investment_theory/) on wsb, using a portfolio derived from South Park episodes. He promised to return with a graph but never did. I took it upon myself to continue his research. \n\nWhile the show definitely had its tenbaggers, I assumed that the good calls on Build A Bear Workshop, Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Sony ($SONY), Amazon ($AMZN) were just lucky, and, all-in-all, the performance should be roughly on par with an index (let's say S&amp;P500, as it uses the same acronym). \n\nI did however decide to look deeper into it, and to my surprise, a very simple South Park Index^[1] drastically outperforms S&amp;P.\n\nThis is how they actually compare:  [2009-2022 graph \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80](https://i.imgur.com/VhUObvd.jpg). \n\nA different comparison showing how good our South Park predictions are is the following: consider you buy a stock mentioned in an episode during that day and keep it for a month, respectively a year - how does the performance compare to buying $SPY on that day? Average returns:\n\n* **1 month hold**: South Park Stock: 5.93% \ud83d\ude80 vs S&amp;P 0.93%\n* **1 year hold**: South Park Stock: 35.42% \ud83d\ude80 vs S&amp;P 11.86%\n\nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future performance and this approach has some small biases^[2], the numbers make it quite clear that South Park has been a really good stock selector. But why is that? You could argue that the publicity that it brought helped, but it's definitely too small of an impact for the large-cap stocks (i.e. AAPL, AMZN). Most likely it's just the fact that the episodes tend to focus on things disrupting &amp; impacting our society, those things that change the way we do things ($TSLA, $AAPL, $TWTR), those we love ($SONY) and those we hate ($AMZN). Buying such companies at an early time is a good way to make a strong return (especially in a long Bull Market).\n\nSo, should you buy the next stock mentioned? Maybe, probably. \n!!This is not financial advice!!\n \n\n[1] The index is an **equal-weighted** combo of all stocks mentioned in episodes in the previous 18 months, and they are \n\n[2] Mainly survivor bias\n\nMore detailed info on data preparation, biases, portfolio construction &amp; rebalancing in my yt on this: https://youtu.be/8CRYaVEQD-4\n\n\n**Later Edit:** By popular demand, here's how the same index construction (except this time position is set the next trading day, as Simpsons airs on Sundays) would perform for **The Simpsons** [2009-2022 Graph](https://i.imgur.com/dTb05BF.jpg). Still better than S&amp;P500, but way worse than South Park. \nThe recent loss is due to positions in $UBER (Mar 2020), $NFLX (Jan 2021), and $RACE (Jan 2022).",

    "title": "Virtue signaling gone wrong: Is TSLA funding the Russian War Machine?",
    "selftext": "Germany [relies on Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/business/olaf-scholz-russia-energy.html) for 55% of its natural gas and 50% of its coal. Germany's Chancellor refuses to boycott Russian energy, saying it \"would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession.\"\n\nAlthough Germany has lots of renewable energy, as of 2020 it [still relied on non-renewables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany#Energy_transition) for 49% of its energy needs.\n\nThe Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory opened yesterday, located just outside of Berlin. The factory *plans to* generate power through solar panels, but the factory isn't finished yet. To what extent are the gigafactory's operations and the gigafactory's construction process relying on the German power grid, which relies on Russian imports and finances the invasion of Ukraine?\n\n**Solar Power**\n\nBerlin gets 1727 hours of sunshine per year on average. That's less sunshine than Seattle gets. It's also less sunshine than other Gigafactory locations. \n\n* Buffalo = 2206 hours \n* Austin = 2643 hours\n* San Francisco (near Fremont) = 3061 hours\n* Reno = 3645 hours\n\nBerlin gets less than half the sunshine that GigaNevada gets, and what's worse is the February and March are particularly bad months for Berlin, averaging only 3-4 hours of sunshine per day.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla's promises and the reality are not the same. For example, GigaNevada had [only 3.2MW of solar panels in August 2021](https://electrek.co/2021/08/09/tesla-slashes-size-gigafactory-solar-array-but-says-grow-largest-world/) out of a planned 70 MW solar array. By the end of 2022, they plan to grow to 24 MW.\n\nThe logical assumption would be that GigaBerlin is behind GigaNevada, and that Berlin has less than 3.2MW of installed solar capacity. With 4 hours of sunshine per day and less than 3.2 MW of capacity, you would generate something around **500 kWh of power per day**. That's enough power for 10 houses per day. Hardly enough power to produce 1,000 cars a week.\n\nFor context, BMW's plant in Regensburg Germany has used [168 MWh](https://phys.org/news/2013-04-automobile.html) in a year, which would be **460,000 kWh per day**. So how much solar generating capacity would GigaBerlin need? \n\n168,000 MWh / 365 / 24 = 19.17 MW power generating capacity needed, twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. That's 7 times GigaNevada's installed capacity. Also the sun doesn't shine 24/7, even in Nevada.\n\nFor Berlin to generate that much electricity from solar panels in March, they would need to install 120 MW of capacity--40 times what is currently installed in Nevada. (You would also need a massive battery system to discharge power when the sun isn't shining). I have a feeling that if Berlin had installed that many solar panels, Elon would be talking about it all day long. He's not.\n\n\n\nConclusion: **There's no fucking way that Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory is net-zero. They're running off of German electricity, which means Russian gas.**\n\nThe kicker:\n\nPutin wants Germany to pay for energy imports using Rubles. Not only is Germany going to finance the Russian war machine, it's also going to help prop up the Ruble--working directly against the sanctions that the rest of the world is trying to use to stop the war. \n\nPositions: Long-Dated Puts on TSLA. Remember my name.\n\n---\n\nEpilogue: \n\nI'm anticipating some counterarguments from people who don't understand how electricity works:\n\n**German Electric Grid**\n\nSome people might argue that the area of Brandenburg generates a lot of renewable energy. That's true. It's also irrelevant. It doesn't matter where you connect to the grid--you're either a net consumer or a net contributor. If the national electricity demand rises because you're a net consumer, then the coal, gas, and nuclear plants will increase their output by adding more fuel. Solar and wind plants can't do that because they rely on nature, not fuel. Here's the definition of an [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) for the apes who don't understand.\n\n**Heat Pumps**\n\nThese cut electricity costs. They don't generate power.",

    "title": "NVDA hypepost",
    "selftext": "I've been holding NVDA stock since 2016 with not a single share sold. I've never been more convinced of the holding and I've always tried to have a realistic, humble view on my gains with it and the company's prospects and risks. But at this point I'm unironically thinking it can compete for #1. Yes, I'm talking **most valuable company on earth in terms of market cap**. The only real competition I see for that could be TSLA fairy retard magic. Other companies above it simply arent growing fast enough to compete. Reasons:\n\nTheir gaming business just keeps serving as a rock solid foundation, it's considered to be their dinosaur business yet it's growing at rapid rates. They had 37% YoY revenue growth with gaming even though there were no major product launches since Fall 2020. It's a proven cash cow to fund completely unrelated projects. Customers have proven that they'll pay anything for a NVDA gpu and I think it's sustainable. Work from home is here to stay and when you spend that much time with your own machine, you want it to be a good one.\n\nData center is up 71% YoY and they just delivered on the H100, securing another 2 years of extreme data center growth with insane margins. Data center will soon overshadow gaming significantly, especially with them being on track with the Grace CPU. Their vision is to deliver the full stack and they're getting close to doing that. One can only imagine what their data center numbers will be 5 years from now. It could be in the medium to high double digit billions of yearly revenue.\n\n[Data center has been chasing gaming revenue and it's set to blast ahead.](https://preview.redd.it/9jb27l21uip81.png?width=2059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6942f773e6f2f670f0b9f2478d240bbefe098ee1)\n\nNVDA has $11B of automotive revenue in the pipeline and that's just the early innings of that market. They're making smart acquisitions to grow it and are saying it's a $300B TAM. If they capture 10% of that that's going to be already a significant contributor to overall revenue. The analyst models will go wild when automotive revenue starts picking up. You may ditch a high end computer after 5 years but you're not ditching a car after 5 years. The long term opportunity from software services for cars is insane and NVDA is investing heavily into software while delivering the chips also. A car is not a car anymore, it's a computer that happens to be a car and a computer needs uptates. Even if they were to go through rough times which every company does every now and then, they will be cashing in on software services from cars sold 10 to 15 years ago.\n\nAnd on top of that they're going all in on Omniverse. When they announced Omniverse 1 year ago it seemed like a neat little side thing, now it's all over their presentations, they're painting it as a key component to their whole business. Within just one year they went from \"Hey look, we just made this!\" to integrating it as a core part of their AI business.\n\n[Look at this slide and see how many products are already connected with Omniverse.](https://preview.redd.it/aa9fd43ltip81.png?width=1990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2470754161f809d9372adb7a26c0279cfa972aa)\n\nI'm telling you they're seeing something with Omniverse not everyone is ready to see yet. It's pretty obvious when you look at their videos and slides but it's easy to put off as dreaming. And yes, it's too hard to quantify the opportunity yet. NVDA is saying the Omniverse business has a TAM of $300B which is almost a third of their total claimed TAM of $1T. Anything can happen with it. If it takes off seriously NVDA will have transformed as a business yet again and there's no competition in sight for this, they're years ahead. It's so valuable to be ahead in software and to be the first to market. Even if competition starts arising for simulation, everyone will already be used to Omniverse. Getting people to change software is HARD.\n\nI've never been this excited about NVDA. The future is now and they're ahead of everyone else. Their big investment in software is starting to pay off and will lead to margins never seen. To me it's not a question that the stock will see a market cap of $1T soon. I'm ready to believe that they may be going for the homerun, to be the most valuable company on earth. And even if they don't, at worst with the way they're going they'll still a very good company with respectable growth.",

    "title": "NIO is rallying today, here's why.",
    "selftext": "About Nio:\n\n* Founded in Nov 2014\n* First deliveries June 2018 (3 years &amp; 9 months for first delivery)\n* Market cap 36B\n* Share price 21.88 close on March 29th (As I'm writing this it's trading at 23.50\\~ a 7.5% day increase)\n* 2018 total deliveries  11,348 -&gt; 2019 total deliveries 20,565 (81.22% increase over previous year) -&gt; 2020 total deliveries 43,728 (112.63% increase over previous year) -&gt; 2021 total deliveries 91,429 (109.09% increase over previous year)\n* Their losses have also been dropping at staggering amounts, from 2020 to 2021 the operation losses have dropped by a whole 41.2% (excluding share based compensation)\n\nSo as you can see this company has proven to grow at massive rates, (and btw 3 years ago they escaped bankruptcy) so it's very likely to be incredibly profitable in the future. If they keep their current growth up, they'll reach Tesla's current deliveries within 5 years.\n\nOk so now I'll be showing why NIO is underpriced through a small comparison with Tesla, if you think Tesla is overpriced. Click away this post since it'll be a pointless read. (I do agree that Tesla is overpriced at it's current profits, however their future profit potential makes up for it.)\n\nWell the comparison is simple really. If NIO has a market cap of 36B at 91K deliveries. And Tesla has a market cap of 1.146T at 936K deliveries u could translate that into NIO deserving a market cap around 1/10th of Tesla's. This would be something around 90-120B. This leads me to believe that NIO is currently selling at 1/3rd-1/4th of it's true value.\n\nNow as to why it's rallying today, is all due to the promising future it shows and more light being shined upon it today. Especially after new came out thatt Ark Invest's (60B asset value) CEO Cathie Woods sold 146.000 TSLA shares on the 25th of march and, bought 420.057 shares of NIO on the same day. Meaning they dropped some of their Tesla stocks for the booming NIO stock.\n\nOne of the main reasons that NIO is so cheap right now is due to distrust in China, however if you don't experience that and have trust in the EV future and companies such as Tesla, Nio is a ridiculously cheap stock right now with an analyst price target around $40-50 and high estimates of $90.\n\nSources:   [NIO Inc.

The estimates ranged from a low of 278,000 vehicle deliveries to a high of 357,000.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.\n\nThe company recently opened a new factory in Brandenburg, Germany, and had a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 22. Tesla also plans to host a grand opening and \u201ccyber rodeo\u201d event on April 7, at another new vehicle assembly plant it\u2019s building in Austin, Texas.\n\nTesla moved its headquarters to Austin officially as of Dec. 1, but still operates its first electric car factory in Fremont, California.\n\nGlobally, Tesla\u2019s operations during the quarter, which ended March 31, were weighed down by a Covid surge and new health restrictions in China, requiring temporary production halts at its Shanghai plant. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 308,600 EVs, marking a record for the company. \n\nTesla, along with the rest of the auto industry, has also been hurt by widespread parts shortages, and inflation. Critical components like semiconductors remain in short supply, and prices have increased for raw materials like nickel and aluminum after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February. In the U.S., Tesla has been leaving customers waiting for months before filling their car orders.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk warned in mid-March of inflationary pressures on the business, and hiked the prices of its cars in both the U.S. and China.",

I'm predicting it to get into the low 900's, maybe 800's again one last time before value incentive really kicks in to take this baby beyond the stratosphere. \n\nNot to mention, Elon is splitting the stock because it is currently over bought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Wyckoff Price Cycle Visual](https://preview.redd.it/vt4js75ps9r81.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a276aa9a7b62cb95c2d92d1ef24a5244344dfcbd)\n\nThe reason for Elon's stock split is to level out the growth of his company, creating more supply so the demand can continue to rise at a healthy rate. I believe this markdown (one more dip with a volume spike) will occur before the stock split in order to prepare $TSLA to be transferred into its new, healthier and more fruitful soil. \n\nIf there is anything I may have gotten wrong, please share your opinions with me. \n\nEnjoy your happy meal",

The market cap increased from $28B to $40B.\n\nNew changes will come to Twitter after Elon plays a more influential role on Twitter management's decisions in future (if he attempts a buyout). It is impossible to know how this will impact TWTR share price in long term, but I would bet that it will be a positive one:\n\n1. Elon's publicity helps in rebranding Twitter into something cooler that appeals to retail investors (Twitter is now a meme stock)\n2. TSLA whales may buy TWTR shares\n3. Some hedge funds may see this as an opportunity to play both sides -&gt; more trading volume -&gt; more volatility -&gt; higher chance of higher share price\n\nI plan to add into TWTR positions slowly over next few weeks (shares, short puts, ITM vertical call spreads, and leaps etc.). It is possible that TWTR can reach $100 during next bull (trap) run.",

Biggest since 2003, why? No reason, apple is a great company but this recent run was not stimulated by anything.\nTsla, missed delivery, ran 51% in the past 22 days. I cant think of anything but a pump. People buy tesla because its elon and because its tesla, but u cant really think thaflt this price is a fair reflection of the company. \n\nNow the markets in generla. S&amp;P 11% run in 15 days, sitting at 4% of ath. \nNasdaq 17% run in 15 days, sitting at 9% of ath. \n\nI cant see a legitimat reason for such optimism, inflation is highest since 1987, oil prices are up 56% since december. Fed has just hinted more aggresive interest hikes. \n\nI think this is happening becauwe of the fear. Think about this, when inflation is 8% and is projected to be much higher, you wont be buying 5 year bonds for 2.6% gain. The only investment that can beat this inflation is stocks, as we have seen u could have made 17% with nasdaq if u bought is 3 weeks ago. \n\nThese companies are obviously overbought, but this creates more opportunities, think about this, if evertyhing traded at its value the only way to make money would be long term investing. \n\nRemember a year ago ev stock ran 300%, rhey dident have to be profitable, have a plan, or any product. They just needed to be ev. I mean how do u ration buying a company valuet at 9B with 0 earning and no product.\n\nAnd even gamestop, its not a company but a stock, the company is trash but the stock is great. \n\nI am not predicting any crash or recession because its imposible.

    "selftext": "Just think about what you could do if you could 3x your money, guaranteed. You might actually be able to buy a boxable home in Austin and join the tech bros. You might even be able to buy a Tesla. If you don't want to help Tesla stock go to $3000 so that you can buy a Tesla and flex on your friends, then you are selfish and hate the environment. There is nothing better for getting pussy than flexing your wealth while carbon shaming all the poor people. Why do people have gas guzzling cars anyway? By increasing the amount of coal being burnt for all our Teslas we will accelerate the timetable for switching over to clean energy. By doing activist investing, and buying Teslas with those free money 3x gains, we can save the Earth and our bank accounts.\n\nTesla is not a car company; it's an energy company. Teslas are the best cars made by any company on the planet. Or other planets for that matter. When Elon goes to Mars the Martians will buy Teslas so don't tell me how the Earth's population cannot support the current projections. \n\nDoes Elon Musk use his tech bros following to make easy money on TSLA, doggy money, TWTR and other things? Probably, but that's the way it should be. Why should we let Bezos overtake our lord and savior Elon Musk? Investing in the 2020s is all about how you feel. By investing in TSLA you are donating to Elon Musk so that he can save the environment and colonize Mars. \n\nMama Cathie says TSLA should grow to $3000 by 2025. The stock should just be $3000 now if it's going to be worth $3000 why isn't that priced in why wait 3 more years? Just buy it if it is below $3000. It's a free lunch. And don't forget to take your gains to buy a Tesla, unless you can't afford one. Then I guess you should just buy more TSLA calls until you can afford one. TSLA to the moon and beyond.",

If this applies to you, let me explain to you how you can get one for free..using TSLA stock!\n\n1 - Wait for the next dip in TSLA stocks, like the one that occurred in the middle of march 2022.  \n2 - Buy 10k of Tesla call options during that dip with an expiration date about 3 months into the future and a strike near the Tesla ATH  \n3 - Set a limit sell at 5x the price you bought them for  \n4 - Wait for the TSLA price to rebound and your limit sell to execute.\n\nTadaa... you now have enough to buy a Tesla.  \n\nAll you have to do is invest 10k and 3 months later you will have 50k. If you still feel like buying a new Model 3 by then, congratulations you just got it for free. You can thank me later.  \nP.S. this strategy is not Jerome Powell-proof and is subject to market changes based on political economic and situations.",

JPMorgan will be the first of the top six banks to report earnings, with Wall Street focusing on how the volatility caused by the Ukraine war affected investment banking and trading operations.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields fell after reaching their highest level since December 2018.\n\nOil has surpassed $100 per barrel.\n\nThe rise in crude oil prices, along with other commodities, has fueled inflation fears, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. Gasoline prices accounted for half of the monthly increase in the US consumer price index in March. Nonetheless, core inflation increased less than expected, owing in large part to the largest drop in used-car prices since 1969 and a slowing in price growth in other merchandise categories.\n\nOn the geopolitical front, Russian President Putin stated that peace talks with Ukraine have stalled and vowed to continue his military operation in the country, despite calling the conflict a \"tragedy.\" Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has called for additional European Union sanctions against Russia, including oil and all banks.\n\n# SPY - April 13 - Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs74jhuh17t81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be13cedcc5814c4e52662990a02183d8a278237c\n\n* Break 439.76 and look for 441.71\n* Break 441.71 and look for 441.71 - 442.58\n* Beak 442.58 and look for 444.58 - 445.87 - 447.02\n* Lose 437.73 - 436.63 - 435.53 and look for 433.86\n* Lose 433.86 and look for 432.13 - 430.27\n* Lose 430.27 and look for 428.70\n* Lose 428.70 and look for 426.89 - 425.20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5t8zizj17t81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc782a28de6cc9e2e96312fe571af8abe9ebffb\n\n## Wedge - Bullish Bias\n\n* Bullish \ud83c\udfaf: 445.88 - 450.27 ( needs to break 442.42)\n* Lose 433.79 and the pattern is null.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqzckazl17t81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aea891d0351e0538585f73feb784225c3213463b\n\n* Neutral 440-449.

    "title": "NIO Is Resuming Production of EVs After a Covid Halt: Report -- Barrons.com",
    "selftext": "[Barron\u2019s Article Lik](https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/nio-resumes-production-electric-vehicles-china-51649942755)\n\nChinese electric-vehicle maker NIO is *ramping production of its electric vehicles after a short pause due to supply-chain issues caused by Covid lockdowns in China.* \n\nResumption is a good thing, but the shares dipped in premarket trading Thursday. \n\nChinese news outlet the Economic Observer reported the restart Thursday. Vehicle production at NIO (ticker: NIO) has been down for less than one week. \n\n*Production at the Tesla (TSLA) manufacturing plant in Shanghai, for comparison, has been offline since late March.* \n\nNIO's facility, however, is in Xinqiao, Hefei, which is **about 300 miles from Shanghai**\n\nThe NIO shutdown didn't appear to be about local Covid infections. Instead, NIO suppliers located elsewhere were having trouble supplying the plant.\n\nUpon the reported restart, NIO stock was down 0.8% in premarket trading. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.1%. and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.1%. \n\n&gt;Investors haven't really seemed all that concerned with China's new Covid lockdowns. \u2022\u2022\u2022*really??*\n\nTesla stock is down about 5% so far in April, just after the Shanghai plant shutdown commenced, but the Nasdaq is also down 4% over the same span. \n\n&gt;It's difficult to attribute any stock weakness to lost production. (Especially, with the volatility created by CEO Elon Musk offering to buy Twitter (TWTR).\n\nLost production might impact second-quarter results, however. **Analysts currently project NIO will deliver roughly 32,000 vehicles in the second quarter, up from about 26,000 delivered in the first quarter.\n\nFor Tesla, analysts project about 330,000 vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, up from about 310,000 delivered in the first quarter. The Shanghai shutdown appears to have cost Tesla a few thousand deliveries in the first quarter and the second quarter estimate is down from about 350,000 at the start of April. \n\nThe production volatility is just something else NIO investors have to deal with. Coming into Thursday trading, NIO stock is down about 36% year to date and off about 63% from its 52-week high of more that $55 a share. \n\nApril 14, 2022 09:26 ET\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nTL; DR\n\nNIO is back to production after a pause which was not related to the Chinese maniacal Covid control plan. Supply chain because of Shanghai quarantines was the problem. TSLA still on lockdown. Both companies estimated to deliver more vehicles. NIO not in Shanghai, TSLA is.\n\n[view article ](https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/nio-resumes-production-electric-vehicles-china-51649942755)",

    "title": "Quick Gamma analysis of $SPY",
    "selftext": "  Quick market run down for those awake before the bell\n\n$SPY\n\nGamma Environment: Negative (-1.2bn) \n\nKey Gamma Levels:\n\n14th\n\n450 - R3 resistance\n\n447 - R2 resistance\n\n445 - R1 resistance\n\n442 - S1 (First Support)\n\n438 - S2 (Second Support) \n\n435 - S3 (Third Support) \n\nViews:\n\n\\* Following the 80 point rally from the lows yesterday we noted that that the remaining strength despite a high PPI print as mentioned yesterday would likely be as a result of charm flows going into the market from MOPex. Using historical data on Opex without understanding the context of positioning automatically provides limited info on actual movements that are to be expected. \n\n\\* Based on macro conditions we do not expect natural buyers to exist and with negative seasonality appearing we do not expect bounces to be maintained.\n\n\\* VIX levels based volatility range of +1.3%/-1.3%, Negative gamma environment volatility is likely to continue to be more volatile than the prior week given the switch up in positioning. \n\n\\* SPY remains in less negative territory across the board (both short and long term) (now at $-1.2Bn, down from -$1.8bn yesterday looking two months forward). This has normalised the current levels for this this year, we can expect volatility to maintain and should also expect ranges on either side of the equation but a natural trend higher remains as the final parts of inventory are cleared. See gamma results in the discord to view peak positioning. We continue to maintain that the natural trend still remains lower and based on analogues May seems to be a reasonable point at which we reach a bottom. (There remains a LOT of cash on the side lines that is yet to be deployed). \n\n\\* Call volumes +12.8% and put volumes +4.97% with puts now only \\~2x the volume of calls, following a peak call/put volume disparities. This tells us that the hedge is now coming full circle and as a result given the \n\n\\* 10 Delta Put premiums (455C) vs call IV (at the 10 delta, 435P) is 1.5x in the short term and 1.6 xacross duration an IV basis, the skew here suggests that on the short term basis puts aren\u2019t favourable. They do however remain more favourable beyond this week. Additionally this vol isn\u2019t the highest read we have had thus far, with 2x presenting very strong risk reward. IV skew blows out below 425 and with the tails now currently offering an asymmetric return for those involved in the options market. Flows pushing lower should likely slow. \n\nOrderFlow\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/yfPjlxNP/\n\nFor order flow perspective levels please see the levels provided in the chart. See these lines as \u201cbarriers\u201d to overcome and if done then price can be \u201caccepted\u201d into areas where previous buyers (Navajo white = up volume) and sellers (purple = down volume) wanted to engage up until points where there are much greater levels of volume. These are areas that you can consider as greater points of resistance.\n\nCalls/Puts Volume\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/F4PHUd9Y/\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Scenario \n\nAbove 4444 (with continuous bid at 4460) ($ES) additional call buying to increase up the chain at further expiries and up the chain would be needed to continue this drive up. Note the skew toward call buying has lightened again but below we have a large delta of puts are set to unwind today which can give room to a bounce. We need put buying in further duration to lower and call buyers to move higher. Continuous exhaustion @ 4444 (we are at 4419 as of writing - having found repeat support at 4454) in the first 30 mins defines whether there is a clear aggressive direction and a move above could set us up for a hold above 4580 should positioning continue to drive higher. VIX crush below 18 will also help produce the environment we expect.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Scenario\n\nIf we maintain below 4400 in particular we\u2019re interested in further sell off as this level provides a key level down. That being said this remains a strong floor and looks unlikely to break where we assign a 17% probability of this breaking. A break below this could generate sell down to 4300 as Vanna flows above drive us lower and with put gamma at 4350 and below increasing exponentially. This begins to act as a magnet to price with selling intensifying from above and below. We would need to see call buying decline in AAPL/TSLA as well as semi weakness, very important as TSM has just reported upward guidance. VIX maintaining over 22, new highs with VIX combined with ES new lows 22 which adds credibility to increased sell. We would also need to see some weakness in big tech, in particular we note AAPL, TSLA, MSFT as these remain the key drivers of the prior rally particularly and strength in gold miners and other precious metal cos (NEM, GLD,SLV etc)",

    "selftext": "($12,000 GAAP earnings per EV sold) \\* (20,000,000 EVs sold annually) \\* (50 P/E) =\n\n$12T market cap or approximately $12,000/share\n\nDo I expect these numbers to happen? I dunno, doesn't matter what I think.. but you know what's important? The extraordinary potential upside for TSLA. I encourage everyone to use your own numbers. This DD will aim to educate you on identifying what these three numbers could become, and how to keep track of TSLA as an investment\n\n1) GAAP earnings per EV\n\n|Quarter|GAAP EPS|EVs Delivered|GAAP earnings per EV sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021 Q1|$0.39|184,800|$2,361|\n|2021Q2|$1.02|201,250|$5,671|\n|2021 Q3|$1.44|241,300|$6,677|\n|2021 Q4|$2.05|308,650|$7,432|\n\nYour homework: How is GAAP earnings per EV going up? and How high will it go? These are not easy questions to answer. You have to dig. Check out ASP, gross margin and operating margin for Tesla, as well as their trends. Understand Economies of Scale and Wright's Law. Look into the innovation that Tesla is attempting in building EVs. Finally, every quarter.. do your math! GAAP earnings per EV = (GAAP EPS \\* outstanding shares)/(EVs delivered). Use [ir.tesla.com](https://ir.tesla.com) as your source\n\n2) EVs sold annually\n\nThis is the biggest risk to Tesla and most important thing to monitor imo: execution. Their goal is 50% growth in sales YoY. To be bullish, we have to see them hit that goal.\n\nHomework: Do your math to predict sales based on 50% growth YoY, and watch to see if they achieve their goal. They sold 936,000 in 2021, if they grow at 50% YoY, what year will they reach 20M?\n\n3) P/E\n\nUnfortunately, there will always be speculation here. Tesla will likely always try to innovate and find new businesses to grow. They're currently focused on Solar and Energy, FSD and the Tesla Bot in addition to EVs. So long as there's new innovative business opportunities, what P/E value does that justify? Your homework is to make your own speculation here. 25 P/E? 50 P/E? 10 P/E? You decide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, use your own numbers! Decide if this upside is really there, and if you decide that TSLA could continue to grow, then you're now equipped with some nice metrics to follow and help you maintain conviction in your holding.\n\nHappy rollercoaster riding friends \ud83c\udfa2",

    "selftext": " For [years](https://www.newconstructs.com/more-broken-promises-from-tesla/), Elon Musk has used hype to prop up Tesla\u2019s stock. It\u2019s worked so well that other companies have followed his lead. But now we think the world has seen that the emperor has no clothes. \n\n \n\nThe attempted Twitter [**TWTR,** **-1.68%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TWTR?mod=MW_story_quote) takeover is yet another example of Musk bullying his way into what he wants and underscores how his superstar status cannot always convince people to overlook his irreverent, reckless and potentially illegal behavior.

I keep going back to this every few months when I make retarded moves.\n\n\"IMO, trading options have similarities to playing poker and in order to be successful in the long run you need to be disciplined and refrain from making common mistakes. I\u2019m going to list common mistakes and some tips here. Please suggest more. Hope we all lose less tendies!\n\n1. Refrain to trade low volume options . These contracts will have really wild bid/ask spread, or really low volume, which reduces your chance to make profit significantly. For example how can you win if you trade $ROPE 100c when the bid ask spread is $69/$96 per contract?\n2. Refrain to trade very low price options (e.g 1-10 cents) because your broker commissions will eat up a significant amount of the transactions. Think how much commissions you have to pay to buy 10000 contracts of 0.01 $ROPE 1000c which costs $10000 of premium.\n3. Refrain to buy near-dated far OTM options, because this is almost a sure way to burn your money. Even worse, even if you guess the direction right, you may still have a substantial loss. Think $PEI 500% OTM 2DTE. Btw $PEI is a great stock to own. Example: on 04/13 you bought SPY 496c 04/17 when SPY=280. On 04/14 SPY rises to 285. Guess how much you made on your call options?\n4. Know when to select OTM vs ITM options: in general: OTM is higher risk/higher return. Have some sense of OTM price movement - even when you guess the direction right, far OTM options won\u2019t make you money because of low delta. ITM is more expensive. ATM is typically a safe choice if you just want to make a directional bet.\n5. Know theta-crush. Your options will lose time-value every day, so refrain from buying short-dated options unless you know what you're doing.\n6. Know the effects of IV (VIX for SPY) on options price. Sometimes even when you guess the direction rights, you may lose money because of VIX movements. Know how to hedge for VIX movement.\n7. Refrain from using market orders when possible: limit orders will give you the price you want.\n8. Understand the margin impact of different options strategies.\n9. Understand the impact of your broker commissions.\n10. Bank management: never YOLO your entire portfolio into one position, because if you lose, there\u2019s 0% chance to make it back. Learn [http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/](http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/). If you want to get in a large (50K+) position, average in/out may be a good idea.\n11. Don't open too many positions unless you're a bot. It's hard to manage manually and easy to make mistakes.\n12. (Mostly) don't follow autist DDs that you can't explain.\n13. Learn the market hours!\n14. Options strategies can be complex to visualized. Use your broker's performance profile tool to understand the performance implications before making a trade.\n\n**Some risky options strategies that you should only do when you know what you\u2019re doing**\n\n* Naked puts, i.e. short puts: very risky especially in a recession: when the underlying crashes you\u2019ll lose lots of money\n* Synthetic shorts: i.e. long puts + sell calls, also very risky, only know when you\u2019re 90% sure of the direction.\n* Naked calls, i.e. short calls: also pretty risky if the underlying moons.\n* \u2026\n\n**Less risky options strategies:**\n\n1. Covered calls: very low risk. You hold shares, and sell OTM calls to cover them and collect the premium.\n2. Cash secured puts: sell puts but you have cash to cover it. This is good when you\u2019re willing to buy the shares if it drops, otherwise you collect the premium.\n3. Diagonal: Simultaneously entering into a long and short position in two options of the same type (two call options or two put options) but with different strike prices and different expiration dates. Typically these structures are on a 1 x 1 ratio. This is less risky and can hedge you against IV as well. For example if you bearish on USO, buy a 4p 05/15 and sell a 3.5p 04/24, that way if USO moves upward on the week ending 04/24 you\u2019ll collect the near-dated premium.\n4. Learn how to sell options. Every mistake you made as an option buyer is probably a chance for you to profit as an option-seller.\n\n**Practical tips**\n\n1. Use tools to scan top volume options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders) . This can give you some confirmation.\n2. Use tools to scan unusual activity options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity) Try to think why people are making that trade. Your broker also has tools to scan these.\n3. Take advantage of L2 flow data if your broker provides.\n4. Sometime when you can't make a long-term directional bet, it may be profitable to day-trade or swing-trade (hold your positions for 1-3 days).\n5. Know common ETFs:\n\n* SPY: everyone knows this. The most liquid options to trade.\n* IWM: tracks Russell 2000. Also pretty liquid. Trade this if you don't want expose to big techs.\n* Sector specific ETFs: XLE, XLF, XLC, etc. Also highly liquid.\n* Country specific ETFs: EWU, EWG, EWC, EWA, EWJ ... fairly liquid.\n* Gold: GLD\n* Silver: SLV\n* Oil: USO (make sure you really understand this; it doesn't track oil price)\n* Options of individual stocks: in general, the more liquid the underlying, the more liquid the options, e.g. AMZN, BA, FB, TSLA, ...\n\n**Tips to improve**\n\nLearn more about economics and business to improve your common sense.\n\nAdvanced topics: understand how MM works, gamma hedging, dark pool indicators, probably understand some TAs such as RSI.\n\nDay trade dynamics: power hours.\n\n**Things to debate**\n\n1. Should you use stop-loss orders or not?\n2. When to buy FDs and how much should you spend on FDs?\n3. What is the impact of the underlying delisted on put options? As example OILU closed on 03/29 [https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP\\_421079.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP_421079.PDF)\n\n* On March 15, 2020 ProShares Capital Management LLC announced that it plans to close and liquidate ProShares UltraPro 3x Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILU) and ProShares UltraPro 3x Short Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILD). Each fund trades on NYSE Arca. The last day the funds will accept creation orders is March 27, 2020. Trading in each Fund will be suspended prior to market open on March 30, 2020. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about April 3, 2020 (the \u201cDistribution Date\u201d).\n* Shareholders may sell their shares of a Fund (subject to any applicable brokerage or transaction costs) until the market close on March 27, 2020. From March 30, 2020 through the Distribution Date, shares of the Funds will not be traded on NYSE Arca and there will not be a secondary market for the shares. During this period, each Fund will be in the process of liquidating its portfolio and will not be managed in accordance with its investment objective.\n* These strategies are intended to allow an Oil Fund to preserve a minimal portion of its value in the event of significant adverse movements in a Fund\u2019s benchmark. There can be no guarantee that an Oil Fund will be able to implement such strategies or that such strategies will be successful. Each Oil Fund will incur additional, potentially substantial, costs as a result of such strategies which may cause or increase tracking error and would be expected to have a substantial adverse impact on performance. Use of such strategies would cause an Oil Fund to not perform consistent with its investment objective. Furthermore, in the event that an Oil Fund\u2019s value decreases by 70% or more at any point from its prior day\u2019s NAV, as determined by the Sponsor, the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, in order to maintain the integrity of the ongoing operation of the Fund or for other reasons, may cause such Fund to liquidate some or all of its positions and, in lieu of such positions, invest such assets in cash or money market instruments. The above actions may be taken without prior notification to shareholders and would be expected to cause an Oil Fund not to perform consistent with its investment objective. Under these circumstances, consistent with its general authority, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, cause an Oil Fund to be terminated and dissolved.\"\n\nLike I said, not my post. don't give me anything.

    "title": "$LCID MegaDD",
    "selftext": "So I was at a dinner the other night and the topic of EVs came up regarding $TSLA and $LCID. To my surprise, everyone was gushing over LCID and how they can't wait to make it rich so their wife's boyfriends can go on yet again another vacation, while they stay in their mom's basement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut my biggest issue with $LCID isn't their wonderful built in house tech. It's the way they are positioning themselves in the market as a \"Luxury\" brand and shooting themselves in the foot with it. Before I get to why, lets discuss what is LUCID in the eyes and minds of the retards (you).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Lucid will do poorly short term as war rages, It will get bought off by AAPL or another tech giant or a heavy partnership will ensue with a real luxury brand and lift-off. LCID to $10 then to $100.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Long Version**\n\n**What is Lucid? (From the perspective of a Retard)**\n\n* It has real tech not like the other EV that put a diesel engine inside their EV truck and runs away with the money.\n* It has some dude who was the head of making the Model S - Elon Daddy doesn't like him. He speaks British and has a soothing voice.\n* The Lucid as a company aims to be a LUXURY brand, they don't see themselves as direct competitors to TSLA but to Mercedes.\n* Why I think LCID will get bought out by AAPL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My comments (Transcended Retard) to each of the viewpoints above**\n\n&gt;It has real tech not like the other EV that put a diesel engine inside their EV truck and runs away with the money.\n\nI agree, no one thought they could actually deliver something yet, they not only proved everyone wrong but they have the most efficient battery miles per KwH AND an in house motor that is unparalleled (until TSLA upgrades theirs in soon time - which will remove them from this only advantage point)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It has some dude who was the head of making the Model S - Elon Daddy doesn't like him\n\nElon is a big reason for TSLA success, don't get me wrong, there are exceptional engineers that work at TSLA, SpaceX etc. But that's because of the love and ambition of Elon and his vision. He goes on podcasts, he sends a shit ton of memes. He says fuck you to SEC. And everyone in the finance world love it. The amount of volatility and gainz he brings through his twitter alone is daunting. It creates more volume, speculation and price action and he knows that. Peter (the british guy) is not Elon, he's a real engineer and is putting the car (product) in front which is great! But it's not enough to get a slice of what they want from this sector.  Elon is thinking low cost, scale and annihilating through tweets (he has no marketing team, he has tweets). Lucid has none of that, But they have luxury, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;LCID is aiming to be a LUXURY brand, it's not competing really with TSLA, so fuck Elon!\n\nLets go to the basics.\n\n**Definition of luxury** \\- *the state of great comfort and extravagant living*. Top lux brands are Porsche, Gucci, lots of purses, ferrari etc etc. Apple is a top brand, not a Luxury brand, but we will get to that later.\n\n**Definition of a successful Brand -** When you see the brand, it awakes something inside the persons psyche (mind fuckin) that the organization wants you to.\n\nA successful **luxury** **brand** for Lucid is, when anyone sees it, drives it, sits in it, they should feel like it's the best experience they've ever had in a car. It should feel like a private jet for fuck sake inside and outside,  It needs to turn heads.\n\nI've yet to test drive the LCID, but I did go to a store to check it out. It felt good, massage seat, nice panels, sunroofs, etc.... but it didn't FEEL luxury; I hope this changes with the drive. Alexa Integration isn't luxury, Third party integrations isn't luxury.\n\nAnd finally, TSLA is playing the long game, they are scaling and don't care about building premium but their brand is def going to get a premium line eventually. The moment, Model S integrates better material and massage seats and what not, what differentiates LCID?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why I think LCID will get bought out by AAPL.\n\nAAPL history with TSLA is interesting, Elon sent email to Cook to buy TSLA which didn't get read. AAPL hired bunch of team to try to build their own car, then decided to scrap it. I haven't been keeping up to see if they still are and I think they would be fools to join the race now. So why would AAPL be interested in LCID? Because LCID is like the baby AAPL wishes it had, because it reminds them of who they are.\n\n**Story Telling and Design, Design, Design.**\n\nWhat's in it for AAPL? Battery Tech and an opening into a new sector that's not limited to just automobiles but can be expanded into jets, boats.",

Here are the results.\n\n* **Earnings per share:** $3.22 vs $2.26 expected\n* **Revenue:** $18.76 billion vs $17.80 billion expected\n\nEarly this month, Tesla reported [vehicle deliveries](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2022-vehicle-production-and-delivery-numbers.html) of 310,048 for the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the period ending March 31, 2022.\n\nWednesday's earnings call comes amid news of CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/)'s hostile takeover bid for [Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR), the social media platform he has relied on to promote Tesla and his own public image for years.\n\nMusk no longer leads or speaks on every Tesla earnings call. But ahead of Wednesday's update, he said that he plans to be on the call, which starts at 5.30 p.m. ET.\n\nTesla recently opened two new factories outside of Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas, and the CEO appeared for both grand opening events.\n\nInvestments in these massive new facilities are part of Tesla's effort to localize production and lower the cost and improve the speed of distributing vehicles from factories to customers in major markets throughout Asia and Europe.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla has been facing semiconductor chip and other parts shortages, as well as inflationary pressures that are impacting the entire autos industry stemming from the pandemic, and exacerbated by Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the last days of the first quarter, Tesla's vehicle assembly plant in China was forced to suspend production due to extreme Covid control measures in and around Shanghai. The company is now reportedly resuming some production there, and asking employees to [sleep at the factory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-18/tesla-shanghai-sets-out-hand-washing-sleeping-plans-for-workers).\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., Tesla's labor and other business practices are under the microscope.\n\nA court filing on Monday [revealed](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=306105268&amp;amp;z=09519e74) that in addition to previously reported investigations by the SEC and DOJ, Tesla has been dealing with a previously undisclosed probe by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which enforces civil rights laws against workplace discrimination.\n\nThe EEOC probe preceded a lawsuit by California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, in which the state civil rights agency alleged that Tesla has ignored and enabled anti-Black harassment, discrimination and rampant racism at its Fremont factory. Tesla disputed the allegations and accused the DFEH of targeting the company to create a press spectacle.\n\nSome investors are interested in how Tesla plans to address these allegations, according to questions submitted to Tesla ahead of earnings calls [via Say Technologies](https://app.saytechnologies.com/tesla-2022-q1).\n\nBut more shareholders want to know about Tesla's progress on new products and scaling production in Germany and Texas.\n\nAmong other things, they are seeking updates on Tesla's ability to produce and use 4680 battery cells in its cars and energy storage products. They also want more details on a \"futuristic\" driverless robotaxi that Musk teased at an Austin [factory event recently](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-hosts-cyber-rodeo-party-to-open-austin-factory.html), and on the company's experimental driver assistance system, FSD Beta.",

    "title": "The game-changer in mobile broadband connectivity - $ASTS",
    "selftext": "Fellow degenerates,\n\nToday, I will do an update of a DD I posted about a year ago ([first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6b5f9/asts_a_global_mobile_broadband_solution/)) regarding [AST SpaceMobile Inc.](https://ibb.co/8D9BL9C) ([$ASTS](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/asts) \\- c.$1.5bn market cap) and why I think this is one of the most asymmetric risk/reward play in the market (100x opportunity with limited downside over the next few years).\n\n**The company will tap into the $1T cellular broadband market while lifting millions out of poverty and making cellular dead spots a thing of the past.** The current market environment has created a unique opportunity for retail to frontrun institutional investors.\n\nFirst of all, I am still young and full of cum. I have been a long time lurker on wsb (joined somewhere about 5 years ago) and started gambling with about $1,000 in February 2020 (my only deposit). I currently [peaked at $1,031,507 and change in January 2021](https://ibb.co/hm27s7f) after selling $GME at $357. I withdrew about $15,000 to go on holidays and the rest I kept invested (basically 100% of my net worth). My goal is to reach 8 digits by the end of the decade.\n\nI attribute my current result to mainly three things:\n\n* Obscene amount of luck on several plays during an exceptional market environment in 2020 and 2021.\n* Cutting losers quickly and letting winners run (while also being numb to numbers on a screen).\n* A focus on asymmetric risk/reward investments, insane upside potential with a tamed downside risk.\n\nAnyway onto the actual post.\n\n# Finding diamonds in the wasteland of recent IPOs and SPACs\n\nHumans in general vacillate between fear and greed. This creates mispricings in the markets.\n\nIt is hard to argue against the fact that most IPOs and SPACs in recent times have been the result of massive greed and hype. Almost all of these companies have overstated their business case which has resulted in an avalanche of overvaluated shit (HOOD, BMBL, most SPACs, etc.) being fed to the public markets.\n\nThis has among other things resulted in a massive sell-off and extreme fear in most speculative/growth stocks which for the most part may be justified. However, it has also created an opportunity to pick up diamonds in the dirt.\n\nI believe ASTS is one of those rare diamonds.\n\n# The business case for AST SpaceMobile\n\n&gt;Our aim is to bridge the connectivity gap faced by billions. - Abel Avellan\n\n**ASTS is building the first cellular broadband connectivity constellation** and addressing accessibility and affordability issues faced by billions of people all across the globe. **Their solution does not require expensive fixed antennas (Starlink dish) nor a specialized satellite phone (traditional satellite solutions), just your regular smartphone**.\n\n**The Adressable Market**\n\nThere are currently [5.3bn phones moving in and out of cellular coverage](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/data/) as people go about their everyday life. This is an &gt;$1T market currently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\n* usage gap (refers to those who live within the footprint of a mobile broadband network but are not using mobile internet services) of about 3.4bn people, and\n* coverage gap (refers to those who live in an area not covered by a mobile broadband network) of about 0.5bn people.\n\nThis represent almost [4bn people who would benefit from an affordable mobile connectivity solution](https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-State-of-Mobile-Internet-Connectivity-Report-2021.pdf). One cannot overstate the importance of affordable connectivity to lift people from poverty and generate growth in our economies.\n\n**The Value Proposition**\n\n[Image of the satellite](https://preview.redd.it/r81cw0csfnu81.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79cad7428b7c2f35ae04888792a8e9562aacdb74)\n\nIn order to achieve their goal, the company will initially build a 168 satellites constellation (of huge satellites called BlueBirds) in [multiple phases](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001780312/000095017022005212/asts-20211231.htm).\n\n[Phases and countries covered](https://preview.redd.it/aaqbppptfnu81.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=451a91386e8902dd7f2b04c47da9f607909dc05d)\n\nThe Equatorial Phase (covering 49 countries) is scheduled to launch in Q1/Q2 2023, while the rest of the constellation will be launched by late 2024. MIMO functionalities will be enabled in 2025.\n\nThe uniqueness of their solution (compared to Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb and traditional satellite constellation) is the ability to connect to a regular smartphone. In order to *talk* to regular smartphones you need some big ass satellites (Your mom-sized satellites) as well as the right spectrum (can't do it with spectrum owned by current satellite operators like Starlink).\n\nYou can think of their satellite (BlueBirds) as American Tower ($AMT) towers in space. ASTS doesn't own the spectrum and therefore relies on Mobile Network Operators (MNO, such as Vodafone, AT&amp;T, etc.) to provide the right spectrum ([for 2G, 4G, 5G and other LTE-protocols in the 3GPP family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#/media/File:Cellular_network_standards_and_generation_timeline.svg)), basically allowing you to watch 4K porn anywhere on Earth (wink). It is therefore important to see how well they are able to attract MNOs.\n\n**The MNO Agreements and Early Traction**\n\n[Countries currently covered under agreements](https://preview.redd.it/0oi83uxwfnu81.png?width=1449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cca8ce3adb72f5b3d9ad41b75619b0a8c9d2fec9)\n\nThey have agreements for a revenue-share model with at least 17 (more have been found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1tHqty8-LoaN4NkSE-O2M9AJPS2rrKzJ84uTXRWz-7vM/htmlview?pli=1#)) of the biggest MNOs representing more than 1.8bn potential users that can be turned on as soon as the constellation is operational.\n\n[Known agreements and subscriber count](https://preview.redd.it/pgflwjczfnu81.jpg?width=279&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba8960d3e2f88b37d9e34aa73cd1ef7941c35a4b)\n\nThey will be able to easily turn on these subscribers as soon as the constellation is online. Now imagine if they can just tap 5% of the 4.0bn people in the usage and coverage gap. That's 200m additional subscribers which would make ASTS one of the biggest MNOs on the planet (twice as big as AT&amp;T). This is not even accounting for the fact that their solution could attract mobile subscribers from other MNOs. It it also important to mention that some of these companies are also heavily invested in the company.\n\nNow this surely seems very attractive and therefore it is important to ask about competition, this is my next point.\n\n**The Competition**\n\n&gt;Competition is for losers. - Peter Thiel\n\nThere are often big misconceptions about who the competitors are.\n\nCurrently, ASTS is the **first and only** company building a mobile **broadband** connectivity constellation **directly to any smartphone**.\n\nThere is another private company that is building a similar yet widely different constellation already capable of *talking* to regular smartphones (proving the concept). It is [Lynk](https://lynk.world/). However, they only offer the ability to send a few text messages a few times a day (their satellites being to small = less power), can't stream or call someone. They are way underfunded ($10m raised) and have way less MNO agreements than ASTS. On the other hand, they prove the technological feasibility of ASTS.\n\nIt is important to note that other LEO constellations like Starlink, Kuiper or OneWeb are not direct competitors to ASTS. They cannot *talk* directly to smartphones (but need a an [antenna - dish](https://ibb.co/VHfPKvH)). Think of it like mobile subscription vs. fixed internet subscription.\n\nOn the other hand, other satellite constellations (usually GEO) like Iridium and are potential competitors. However, they do not have the spectrum for broadband (aka MNO agreements - satellite operators and MNOs traditionally hate eachother btw) and their satellites need a [specialized satellite phone](https://ibb.co/2PVNdPc) (like that scene in the movie Wall Street) vs. your regular smartphone.\n\n**The Management**\n\nAbel Avellan, the CEO, is deeply aligned with shareholders as he hold 43% of economic rights and is only paid minimum wage. That's what I call skin in the game. Moreover, he is behind most of the key patents protecting the company's technology and manufacturing processes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, the business case seems strong, but what could it be worth?\n\n# How to value this business\n\n&gt;The easiest investments are when you don't need a calculator to understand that it is a bargain - Warren Buffett\n\n**Revenues**\n\nAST SpaceMobile solution aims to target most people on Earth. [There are 8bn people on Earth currently](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). We can safely remove people from China, Russia, North Korea and the like from this equation (about 1.8bn people, but let's say 2bn just to be on the safer side).\n\nSo that equates to 6bn individuals. Out of these individuals you have people who already have connectivity (let's assume 50% of those - GSMA estimate is 51%), some who are in the usage gap (40% of those - GSMA estimate is 43%) and others that don't have connectivity yet (10% of people - GSMA estimate is 6%).\n\nNow we have:\n\n* 3bn connected people\n* 2.4bn usage gap\n* 0.6bn unconnected\n\nLet's assume some market penetration for each category:\n\n* Connected people in the cities will likely not need ASTS service in their daily life, only perhaps people who hike, go the sea, take the plane from time to time or commute through deadspots. A rough guess could be that 1% of people in that segment use ASTS service regularly.\n* For usage gap people, they likely want connectivity but it is either not accessible everywhere or it is too expensive for them with currently available plans. A good guess is that the market penetration might be much higher for these people, let's assume 5%.\n* For unconnected people it might be even higher, something like 10% maybe, as ASTS is will likely be their only affordable option.\n\nThis is gives us about 210m people that would be monthly subscribers to ASTS service. Let's now make assumptions for the average monthly revenue per user (ARPU).\n\nCurrently the ARPU worldwide is about [$8.5 / month](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/data/). But ASTS wants to be more affordable than that (and will most likely be).\n\nSo let's group our first segment \"connected people\" on one side and \"unconnected people\" on the other (usage gap + unconnected gap).\n\nLet's assume connected people will pay $6 / month ($3 go to ASTS and $3 go to the MNO in the respective countries). For unconnected people we will assume affordability is a big barrier currently so they will pay much lower prices. Let's assume $2 / month ($1 to ASTS and $1 to the MNO).\n\nIn total we get **$3,240m revenues a year** (we multiply ARPU x months). This is I believe a very conservative estimate as the ARPU is significantly lower than current market and therefore the market penetration might be significantly higher). Moreover, the company management aims for higher numbers (about $6bn for their 168 satellite constellation) but the truth is likely somewhere in between.\n\nLet's keep our base assumption and move to the next part, expenses.\n\n**Operating expenses**\n\nYou have two main components of operating expenses for this type of business: paying your engineers/tehnicians and flying the satellites. The latter is actually quite negligible for a 168 constellation which can be mostly automated.\n\nThey currently have about [566 employees](https://investors.ast-science.com/static-files/659b5e67-3374-4dbd-a60f-86b59c8eba76) working for them (of which 386 FTEs). Let's conservatively assume they still need to double the workforce to 1,000 employees and they pay on average (technicians, engineers, back-office people) an average of 100k a year or even 200k a year. Let's assume the latter as you want big brains in the company.\n\nThat's $200m a year in personnel costs, we can add $40m for other expenses such as rent, energy, flying the satellites etc. So in total we have **OPEX of $240m a year** (92% EBITDA margins).\n\nYou might think these type of operating margins are insane, but they are quite common in these types of businesses (look at American Tower or other satellite providers if they didn't need to sell antenna dishes or satellite phones). The significant part of the costs are in CAPEX, so let's talk about that.\n\n**Capital Expenditures**\n\nYou actually need to build the constellation in order to generate those revenues. The constellation will consist of 168 satellites as discussed earlier. Management estimates the costs per satellite to be between $10 and $15m. (These could significantly be lower if SpaceX manages to start launching their Starship launch vehicle).\n\nAt $15m a pop, we have total capex of $2,520m. **Let's round that to $3,000m total constellation capex** just to be on the safer side (you know inflation and what-not). This is quite conservative as it is almost 2 times what management expects to pay for the constellation. But better safe than sorry. You can also compare that with Starlink's projected costs of $20-30bn for the whole constellation.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow, the big question remains. How much is this business worth?\n\nYou pay $3bn for a constellation that conservatively generates about $3bn in EBITDA every year (with the constellation lasting about 7-10 years). Let's look at a comparable business such as American Tower.\n\nThey generate generate about $5bn in EBITDA and trade at 24.5x EBITDA (EV/EBITDA multiple). If we use this multiple in our case, we get a Enterprise Value north of $70bn (about a 46x current price - company is worth around $1.5bn currently). Even at a very conservative multiple of 10x EV/EBITDA (S&amp;P500 average is between 15x to 17x, Iridium - more capital intensive and less profitable is 16x), this is still a 20-bagger in just a couple of years.\n\nDisclaimer: this is obviously a very rough valuation and you can make other assumptions if you'd like.\n\nThis valuation does not account for expected growth in number of users, ARPU and expansion of the constellation to more than 168 satellites. If we take a more bullish stance, I strongly believe this could  become a 100-bagger if the company executes over the years.\n\nIf you want other opinions here are a few Target Prices (my estimates are more conservative):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Current Price|Target Price|Bearish|Base|Bullish|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Deutsche Bank|$8|$32|$6|$35|$86|\n|Barclays|$8|$29|N/A|$29|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, a 100-bagger obviously does not come without any significant risks so that's what we will discuss next.\n\n# Key risks that need to be accounted for\n\n**Funding risks**\n\nAs of right now, the company is only fully funded for the Equatorial Phase of the constellation (first 20 satellites) - thanks to the SPAC (with little to no redemptions unlike many others). This phase will already generate significant cashflows thanks to highly profitable business model but will likely not be enough to fund the whole constellation. Therefore, it is important to consider the different avenues for funding:\n\n* Capital raise: this is likely to be honest (as any high growth transformational company - a good example is $TSLA - however Tesla's business model is much more capital intensive), but there are a couple things to consider as well:\n   * First, the shareholder who will be most hurt by dilution is Abel Avellan (the CEO), he owns 43% of the company and is only paid minimum wage. Skin in the game. This is likely to minimize the use of such funding.\n   * Second, even if they dilute the shares by 50% (highly unlikely) this is still between a 10x-50x opportunity.\n* Warrants: they can raise &gt;$200m with the warrants they have already issued.\n* Debt/loans: their business model will be quite stable (typical of the industry). Thus, they will likely be able to get advantageous loans in order to fund the constellation.\n* Government grants/subsidies: bridging the digital divide (bringing connectivity to everyone) is a strong priority for every government and is a primary topic on any political agenda. This will come in many forms such as the recent [$9B 5G Rural Fund](https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&amp;f_number=SATPDR2020041300034) (US example), and many other grant programs in all the countries across the world (Starlink got more than $900m in funding from grants). It will come as funding for the constellation, subsidies for end-users smartphones (especially for the unconnected part of the market), etc. This is also likely to be a major catalyst once the technology/business is de-risked (more on that later).\n\n**Technology risks**\n\nA proof of concept has been provided by their initial prototype BlueWalker (BlueWalker) and the fact that one of their competitor has been able to also connect to regular smartphones from space. Another de-risking event will happen with the launch of BlueWalker3 later in June this year.\n\nASTS is the holder of more than 2,100 patents and patent claims designed to protect their intellectual property. While this may not guarantee that they won't be imitated it gives us some protection and moat around the business.\n\nVery informative [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUm3PyiLU0E) on the technology. Another [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ) from ASTS.\n\n**Launch risks**\n\nAST SpaceMobile does not launch its own constellation. They are reliant on large launch providers in order to complete their constellation (such as SpaceX). They have already [agreements in place to launch their satellites with SpaceX](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/09/ast-spacemobile-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-spacex/) (it explains the recent price movement).\n\nThe company has been very clever in designing their satellite to be able to launch aboard Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Moreover, they are able to launch their satellites with other Starlink satellites reducing their reliance on overbooked Transporter rideshare missions (few times a year) and allow them to book launches way more frequently (almost weekly Starlink launches since early this year). This is very significant as Blue Origin has booked most other launch providers and their is a crunch on launch services since nobody is willing to launch aboard Soyuz russian rockets anymore.\n\n**Regulatory risks**\n\nASTS needs regulatory approvals in every country to provide their service. They are helped by local MNOs in order to fast-track approvals (and navigate regulatory hurdles) and most of these approvals will come closer to commercial service in early 2023. Any regulatory approval will be a significant derisking event and catalyst.\n\nAll of the above are potential sources of delay that need to be accounted for.\n\n# Protecting the downside\n\n&gt;Heads I win, Tail I don't lose much. - Mohnish Pabrai\n\nIf everything fails, with this company isn't worth 0.\n\nI will quickly estimate the price floor for the stock based on three things:\n\n* Cash and cash equivalents as of the [last 10K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001780312/000095017022005212/asts-20211231.htm) are $324m\n* AST SpaceMobile holds a 51% participation in a highly successful private company called Nanoavionics (the revenues you will see in the 10K are consolidated from that subsidiary). There are no market price for that company but they grow very quickly (108% from 2020 to 2021) and are likely worth anywhere between $300m and $500m, 51% of that is owned by ASTS.\n* They hold 2,100 patents and patent pending claims that could have some value (maybe).\n\nTherefore, I think the current floor might fall somewhere between $600m and $800m or in stock price that would be $3-4. A 50% loss in value is much better than most of us here anyway.\n\n# Imminent de-risking events and catalysts that will likely close the gap with the business intrinsic value\n\nNow comes the good part, why invest in the company now and why is it so undervalued (other than being a deSPAC with high growth potential)?\n\n**BlueWalker 3 Launch**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sywdsg3gnu81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fcbbbc13231e8648f123cdf3b8538680c5ca83f\n\nThe [launch](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/09/ast-spacemobile-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-spacex/) of their latest prototype - called BlueWalker 3 (or BlueWalker3, a smaller version of the final design) on which they have been working for the past 3 years this summer will be the main de-risking event of the company. The prototype is fully built and is currently undergoing final testing before the launch with SpaceX later in June 2022.\n\nThe exact launch date could be announced any day but will likely come early-mid May (price went up almost 100% when the launch agreement with SpaceX was announced).\n\nThe satellite will undergo major testing in many different countries across the world and will educate the final design (mainly on the software side) for the BlueBird constellation (to be launched early 2023 as mentioned before).\n\nThis event will be the first major event of the company since it became public and put a lot more eyes on the stock.\n\n**Regulatory approvals**\n\nAny regulatory approvals and market access approvals in are major de-risking events from a commercial standpoint. The most imminent approval will come from the FCC on BlueWalker3 testing (CEO is confident in receiving the approval before the launch later in June - but this is the FCC).\n\n**New MNO agreements**\n\nNew MNO agreements are likely catalysts as BlueWalker3 is launched and as we get closer to commercial service. A recent example is the agreement with [Orange](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/25/ast-spacemobile-announces-collaboration-with-orange/) (&gt;200m subscribers). ASTS already has enough agreements but the more the merrier.\n\n# Final comments\n\nMy parting words will be; do your own DD. This is a long-term play (not a get rich quick scheme). This is not financial advice.\n\nThere are many more topics I could have gone into but I tried to keep it short, sweet and balanced.\n\nThank you to all the awesome people who provided help in researching this company.\n\nTL:DR;\n\n* AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is the first and only company to build a mobile broadband connectivity constellation (read the DD if you think this is another Starlink copy cat).\n* The business model is likely able to target a massive market of more than $1T with highly attractive margins.\n* Overall, while the business contains various risks, I believe the risk/reward ratio to be massively favorable. This is a potential 100-bagger (will play out over the next few years, you degenerate) from where I stand.\n\nPositions: [40,000 shares](https://ibb.co/XWYSgkz) (bought 5,000 more since last time).\n\nSee you in a year for another update.\n\nEdit: typos",

    "title": "True believer in Elon and TSLA even now. Here\u2019s what I know, and my question: how do I best yolo so my kids can have little Tesla ATVs",
    "selftext": "Tesla is sitting over $1,000 today after bouncing back (again) from around $800. Our favorite fund manager, Cathie Wood, and the team at ARK smoke the $4,600 a share hopium as soon as they wake up in the morning. If they\u2019re right (and they always, always are) then we\u2019re looking at 450% return on the stock over the next several years. That\u2019s great, but I don\u2019t have the dry powder to buy enough stock to change lives. \n\nHere are my reasons why I really, truly do believe this company is going even higher: and they aren\u2019t what you expect. \n\n1: I genuinely feel for Elon as a human being. If you care to watch him closely in moments of contemplation, he isn\u2019t all 420 jokes and dog memes. This is a man who is badly scarred from childhood, still struggling to fix the world around him like he could never do for himself. This is the type of deep, foundational pain that most people don\u2019t understand but, for those of us who do, explains so much about how driven to obsessive he is. This is a man who is going to literally change the course of human history because he can\u2019t change his own. \n\n2: Tesla isn\u2019t a car company. The things that excite me about the next 3-5 years have nothing to do with that sexy, sexy S Plaid. I\u2019m talking robots. I\u2019m talking battery technology, capacity, and vertical integration. I\u2019m talking about AI that goes beyond autonomous vehicles. I\u2019m talking about Optimus. Come on! The name is literally Optimus!\n\n3: Scale. Elon is all about scale. More, faster, better, and cheaper as they grow. Even while raw materials shoot through the roof, they\u2019re acquiring the whole chain. They\u2019re making everything they can in house or own the suppliers. That type of scalability is literally unheard. \n\nSo I\u2019m in. I\u2019m all in. I\u2019m going to sell my crap stocks like &lt;insert everything&gt; and buy up whatever I can. \n\nHowever, I just bought a home and my kid is about to go to a stupidly, ridiculously expensive college. I foolishly sold 35 shares to help buy shelter so I\u2019m down to just 15. Picking up a few shares now and then when it dips isn\u2019t going to cut it for me. So this has got to be some crazy option play. Exactly what that play is though is TBD.\n\nPositions: 15 shares, no options yet, but a legit, in the wild, true believer.",

    "title": "$APD- A Technical Breakout and Potential Options Play",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have recently been following a company called Air Products and Chemicals inc. (APD) because of a very nice technical setup that I have seen evolve. I know this isn't your typical TSLA yolo that you might find on WSB, but this could still make you money nonetheless if played right. A little background before I get into the TA: APD is a company which sells gases. In fact, they are one of the largest producers of hydrogen gas which makes them poised to be a big player when the hydrogen economy starts taking off. One thing that I found interesting is that there are actually big players out there taking steps to move towards hydrogen as we speak. Just the other day, plug power got a contract with walmart to supply several them with several tons of hydrogen on a daily basis to power their warehouse equipment (forklifts etc.). As a results, I do see a big opportunity for companies such as APD.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/MZMfzzq3/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/MZMfzzq3/)\n\nWhen it comes to the TA, I first watched a break of the resistance seen in the above chart. After the breakout however, resistance was formed at the 38.2 retracement. The stock has held strong and formed what looks to be a handle to a cup and handle formation, a bullish pattern seen in stocks. In addition, the MACD looks to be cycling back to bullish territory soon and the RSI has room to run on this timeframe.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/F5YAfMLb/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/F5YAfMLb/)\n\nOn the one hour chart, I saw yet another bullish pattern forming, this time an inverse head and shoulders. Here you can see the stock is well on its way to forming the last shoulder of the pattern following a strong finish to yesterday even as the general market was dropping. Completion of this patter could propel the stock past the resistance of 253 which lays at the 38.2 retracement level previously mentioned. With a breakout, there are several gaps that the stock may reach which could again, propel the price to higher levels. I am playing this with 5/20 250Cs. \n\nI wish everyone the best in their trades.",

    "title": "Sunday Brunch Chartbook: Recent Market Performance and Analysis",
    "selftext": "Going to try to do this again, with a slightly different approach. I've made similar posts in the past, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/_foldLeft/draft/27f7aafa-c316-11ec-9327-fe7c61585b68).\n\nIn this post I'll run down through various charts - indices, ETFs, some single stocks - to try to create some insight into the market. **We're trying to establish some notion of** ***what's doing well***, ***what's not doing well***, and ***what some market indicators might be telling us***.\n\nI try to refrain from making outright conclusions, or recommendations - this is supposed to be informative, to help people learn there's more stuff in the market than TSLA, NVIDIA, AMD, etc, and how they can look at these other assets to help them make better trade decisions (if an entire sector is on the downturn, maybe you don't want to be buying calls on a single stock in that sector).\n\n# Indices\n\n[SPY 1y](https://preview.redd.it/86xswtxshav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e979e7c576976870c4adfdbce88fbd3d06f3c0df)\n\n[QQQ 1y](https://preview.redd.it/9rmfad1xhav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a3f9f0b0ecfd89c2287d345c1bff064f40b632)\n\n[QQQ 3y](https://preview.redd.it/vdpcr1vxhav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c93c183901376cd36a593b58f8be1410288d07f)\n\n* SPY and QQQ rolled over again into the end of the week, with some pretty heavy selling. Technical-wise we're kinda in no-man's land as of Friday's close, with both indices hovering a bit above their March lows. I suspect we continue down and re-test those, but then the real questions get asked: *is this just a re-test and we bounce? Or do valuations reset further and we have more pain to go?*\n\n[IWM 1y](https://preview.redd.it/9rdxsa3ziav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8edf04c8893d514ade28b7fe537f368b524b8f85)\n\n[IWM 3y](https://preview.redd.it/1ydq8uvrjav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ce70768bb46e3a9e23191eea5cc14dfe7f63b9e)\n\n* Small caps were range-bound for a large part of 2021, and in November broke out. Ultimately this breakout failed, and in retrospect (IMO) really portended the downturn that spread to the rest of the market in January 2022.\n* Small caps have traded down close to %20 from their highs, and have chopped sideways in a lower range as the rest of the market has followed it down. IMO, no rally is legitimate unless we see small caps follow through, and I think we need to get back above the 212 mark in IWM to have any confidence in a rally. If we break below 190, watch for 170 (pre-covid high) as the next level of support.\n\n[RUA 1y](https://preview.redd.it/9kis30r1jav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad63d6ee9b2acbc22544fb26a16fb6b578ba6dbc)\n\n* For those that are unaware, the RUA is the Russell 3000, essentially (but just not quite) the entire US stock market. This is just one way to get a broad view of how everything is performing.\n* Like the SPY and QQQ, this looks to be in no-man's land as well, and I suspect we'll revisit that bottom line in the near-term.\n\n# Sectors\n\n[Sector Performance Comparison, 6m](https://preview.redd.it/c3biqjk1pav81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17492eeadbdee92bda290670476a9741c6dbbaf9)\n\n* This is a pretty busy, but handy chart I look at to give me an idea of relative performance across many market sectors. It's been useful the last few years as we've had a ton of rotation between different areas of the market, and this can help me spot that and trade momentum accordingly.\n* Very recently defensives like health care and consumer stables have been outperforming relative to the broader market, though they gave a bit back this week.\n* The drawdown this week was definitely market-wide, which is somewhat worrying.\n* Energy has still been outperforming, which makes sense given the inflation narrative and what's going on in the world.\n* Curiously, Utilities (XLU) have been outperforming. This is curious because normally in a rising rates environment utilities would underperform.\n\nI'm not going to go through all of these individually, but we'll take a look at a few which are interesting given present market conditions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DJU vs US10y, \\~10y](https://preview.redd.it/3tbtzd4u9hv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d5546a5ca68404a1f6b91e03246d44e6ab3c7b3)\n\n* This is showing the Dow Jones Utilities index compared with the US10y yield, since \\~2012. I've tried to mark out a particular correlation: when yields go up, generally utilities underperform, as they are yield-sensitive. There's been a divergence recently as utilities have been bid up while yields are rising. We should expect this divergence to break down, it may have just started last week.\n\n[DJTA vs DJIA, 1y](https://preview.redd.it/ppiwuckwahv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86599693add472cdd736299968860e49d8688cfc)\n\n* Here we're taking a look at the lately-talked-about Dow Theory, which suggests that if one of the Dow Jones Industrials or Down Jones Transports advances above a previous important high/level, *and the other follows suit*, then the market is most likely in an upward trend.We saw the transports, DJTA, break out during that rally in the second half of March, but the industrials chopped sideways during the same time, not confirming the upward trend and providing some signal that the March rally was most likely a bear market rally and sell-the-rip moment. Transports have since given it all back and traded in-line with the industrials.\n\nMoving on...\n\n# Bonds, Dollar, Sentiment\n\n[HYG, 5y](https://preview.redd.it/xej48stqchv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccf84ee13480fec24e409c47b9f8b303348fd4ee)\n\n[LQD, All Time](https://preview.redd.it/kmv6bttqchv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b17226739a445c9430e1da3058e8d5e2d324620d)\n\n* Aside from government treasuries, it's worth looking at what's going on with corporate credit, bonds sold by US corporations. HYG tracks US high-yield (bad) credit, LQD tracks US \"investment-grade\" (good) credit - companies like JPM, AAPL, etc.Both of these have been rolling over as yields rise (the yields on these bonds are all rising too), and are right around some pretty serious support levels. Personally, I think we start to stabilize or get a pullback in yields near-term, with 3% likely a good top level for the US10y. Or we could just blow through that and see even more carnage in bond markets, which has been historical.\n\n[DXY, 5y](https://preview.redd.it/gihesmeydhv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=295444f30da5c1aab6b22e05179baf6350f90313)\n\n* The DXY is a measure of the US dollar against a \"basket\" of other currencies, but mostly the Euro (50-something % of this index). Dollar outperformance is bad for the US and a lot of US companies: while it gives us more purchasing power abroad, it *raises the cost for foreign purchasers to buy from us*, which hurts revenues. The DXY above $100 is bad news for US stocks, and right now it looks like it's going to try for that recent 5y-high at 102.\n\n[AAII Sentiment](https://preview.redd.it/bxj6k609ghv81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f9d30292416bb1a49e71ce25e922179b851198)\n\n[CCN Money Fear and Greed Index](https://preview.redd.it/3zxqymkaghv81.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b94ec301a00c3aa522cc03e178fe028c6a6a077)\n\n[NYSE New Lows vs New Highs](https://preview.redd.it/2i96umvdghv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3022c0a0bcd56d04885a14c9de0fc027c200567)\n\n* Sentiment is still broadly bearish, but I believe (as others) that we haven't yet hit max capitulation - we still need that final panic selling moment and that's when you can buy. I'm not actually sure we'll get that, or know it in the moment, but I'd be inclined to be bearish for the time being.\n* NYSE new lows vs new highs really broke down last week. Those stocks you think can't go lower, well they can.\n\nGonna call it there for this week.",

    "selftext": "Okay so this might even be my first OP post on reddit. Let me begin by saying I haven't invested any money till now in US stock market but I am thinking of shorting TSLA just based on the valuations.\n\nI know it is more of a meme stock, but how much small investor vs institutional investor money is really in this stock and is the world really that mad about Elon?\n\nI have seen countless articles where he has proved himself to be a d!ck. The latest one being okay to pay the penalty for not announcing his position on Twitter, or might I remind you the caves fiasco where he called a saviour, rapist?\n\nAnywho I think TSLA has created a shift towards electrical mobility but I still don\u2019t think they are that ahead of the competition. From Koreans to Germans or even big ol' Americans everyone is moving towards electric mobility and I think even phase 4 autonomous systems have been created by the likes of Volvo. Even for TSLA where market P/E is ~7 they are trading at ~130 and have equally if not more problems for scaling and democratizing this tech.\n\nIs the Insta generation be all and end all of our era or can this stock really go down?\n\nNeed honest opinions.\n\nEdit: I felt the need to clarify where I was coming from.\nI absolutely agree that Tesla is a big company and deserves to be big but at the same time I feel people are not looking at the competition.\n\nJust giving an example look at Hyundai. Ioniq 5 is a very good electric car. Plus it will be sold all over the world including growing economies. In a time of 5-10 years these economies will buy much more cars because of low penetration per 100 and those numbers will add up. Now this is a global corporation with massive economies of scale and they have already forgone IC development altogether. This is just one example and others are trying equally hard. I feel Tesla is not at all positioned at this change and will not be able to democratize the technology globally.\n\nWith current valuations, it has to be 5x better than any global corp the world has ever seen with enough capital and supplier/vendor situation pretty established. I just don't believe they are 5x better than Daimler.",

It is always possible that the deal collapses at the last minute, the sources added.\n\nMusk, the world's richest person according to a tally by Forbes, is negotiating to buy Twitter in a personal capacity and Tesla is not involved in the deal.\n\nTwitter has not been able to secure so far a 'go-shop' provision under its agreement with Musk that would allow it to solicit other bids once the deal is signed, the sources said. Still, Twitter would be allowed to accept an offer from another party by paying Musk a break-up fee, the sources added.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Twitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTwitter shares were up 4.5% in pre-market trading in New York on Monday at $51.15.\n\nMusk has said Twitter needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\n\nThe deal would come just four days after Musk unveiled a financing package to back the acquisition. This led Twitter's board to take the deal more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal to slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday. read more\n\nThe sale would represent an admission by Twitter that its new chief executive Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, is not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter's shares were trading higher than Musk's offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk's negotiating tactics - making one offer and sticking with it - resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions. Musk did not provide any financing details when he first disclosed his offer for Twitter, making the market skeptical about its prospects.",

    "title": "Breaking: Twitter in Talks to Strike a Deal With Elon Musk",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Twitter could finalize a deal as soon as this week, people familiar with the matter say. The two sides met Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal and were making progress, though still had issues to hash out, people say. The deal is expected to be finalized this week, but there is no guarantee they will reach a deal. \n\nTwit\u00adter Inc. is in dis\u00adcus\u00adsions to sell it\u00adself to Elon Musk and could fi\u00adnal\u00adize a deal as soon as this week, peo\u00adple fa\u00admil\u00adiar with the mat\u00adter said, a dra\u00admatic turn of events just 10 days af\u00adter the bil\u00adlion\u00adaire un\u00adveiled his $43 bil\u00adlion bid for the so\u00adcial-me\u00addia com\u00adpany.\n\nThe two sides met Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal and were making progress, though still had issues to hash out, the people said. There are no guarantee they will reach a deal.\n\nTwitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made April 14 without saying how he would pay for it, and [put in place a so-called poison pill](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-moves-to-block-elon-musk-from-increasing-stake-11650040204?mod=article_inline) to block him from increasing his stake. But after the [Tesla](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA) Inc. [TSLA **-0.37%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA?mod=chiclets)chief disclosed that he has $46.5 billion in financing and the stock market swooned, Twitter changed its posture and opened the door to negotiations, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Sunday.\n\nMr. Musk has said from the beginning that his $54.20-a-share offer is his \u201cbest and final,\u201d and he reiterated to Twitter\u2019s chairman Bret Taylor again in recent days that he won\u2019t budge on price, some of the people said. The conversations between the two sides were expected to focus on issues including what Mr. Musk would pay should an agreed deal fall apart before being consummated.\n\nTwitter is slated to report first-quarter earnings Thursday and had been expected to weigh in on the bid then, if not sooner.\n\nThe potential turnabout on Twitter\u2019s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n\nMr. Musk made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company\u2019s decision.\n\nMr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn\u2019t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to [reduce the platform\u2019s reliance on advertising](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-elon-musk-would-do-with-twitter-11650200403?mod=article_inline), as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n\nSome shareholders rallied behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC\u2019s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. \u201cHe has an established track record at Tesla,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.\u201d Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n\nMr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer\u2014which is far from guaranteed\u2014he would still need a way around the company\u2019s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n\nOne oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target\u2019s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter\u2019s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year\u2019s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n\nTwitter\u2019s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. Mr. Musk has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, which totals more than 9%.\n\nThe financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days\u2014which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive\u2014likely contributed to Twitter\u2019s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk\u2019s proposal.\n\nTwitter\u2019s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has \u201cgone nowhere\u201d since the company went public eight years ago, Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management, said earlier. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n\nMr. Gramm said Twitter\u2019s board can\u2019t walk away from Mr. Musk\u2019s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,\u201d he said.",

This was recently reinforced during a TED interview where he showed off his humanoid robot that totally could be used as sex dolls and is what he's betting FSD on.\n\nThe human verification statement could very well help solve for this. For those of you that can read, CAPTCHA was originally created to help finish transcribing scanned books due to a lack of visual AI by software. They've subsequently leveraged ape power to solve more complex problems like protein folding. I think the 44B he just threw down is not just to secure a trolling platform, but to harvest the analogue compute power via anti-bot verification to solve for real world visual driving and humanoid function model training.\n\nIn short, I think he's building the world's biggest computer to finish the real world visual AI problem for Tesla.\n\nWhat is this worth for Tesla?

No wonder this world is in shambles and Musk wants to leave to Mars after visiting Uranus. Musk has a great opportunity for Tesla's non-existent marketing.\n\nFord, $F, spends on average, $2,000,000,000, every single year on marketing. Whether it may be sporting events, team sponsorships, videos, superbowl ads, instadumb, facialbook, titter, or even snapcock, they still spend the money and show little for it. However, after Ford is done wasting money, General Motors, $GM, steps up to hump. Just like Ford, GM spends $2,000,000,000+ every bloody year. As for returns, MINIMAL for the amount spent.(Fun Fact : $F spent actual money, making their car's infotainment screen scan roadside ads instead of making better cars. no joke)\n\nNow we move on to Tesla. And if you somehow don't know what I'm about to say, computers at your local library are good for more than porn. Use them to fact check and research you twats. Tesla, $TSLA, spends $0 for marketing every single year. They rely on other peoples passion and social media for marketing. Similar to Starbucks, and with the same waterfall effect. The most trending car on the planet is LITERALLY just like the most trending coffee on the planet(costa fans stfu). With Musk purchasing Titter with his own funding, he could, in theory, use the platform as a marketing outlet for Tesla without adding a marketing budget.\n\nThoughts?\n\nPS : I am a fucking chicken.

    "title": "The real reason behind Musk's TWTR buyout",
    "selftext": "The following article, and Bezos's tweet, is very revealing I think: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-looms-large-over-twitters-future-under-elon-musk-11650993087?mod=Searchresults\\_pos4&amp;page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-looms-large-over-twitters-future-under-elon-musk-11650993087?mod=Searchresults_pos4&amp;page=1)\n\nIn short, while CCP does not allow twitter in China, they (government and state mouthpieces) have been ramping up their activity on Twitter in the last few years. Unfortunately for them, the current policies/regulation of twitter means that their posts are either labelled 'misinformation', 'fake news' or their accounts get labels that reveal them to be state/ccp accounts.\n\nNow, taking a step back, we all know the massive effort that Russia made in the last several years to infiltrate and propagandize through social media and news outlets so that they a) improve the image of Russia in the West, and b) sow divisiveness and polarization in western countries. As the Ukrainian war erupted, a lot of those Russian propaganda tentacles were severed, and a lot of bot/spam farms got blocked etc. China is on the same path. They know they need to rebuild their image due to their severe human rights violation and social suppression, and leverage media/propaganda to further their global interests.\n\nGoing back to Musk now. Thinking strategically for the next decade and where Tesla will be, he knows very well that a) Competition in the west will heat up, and b) China is by far the biggest market for EVs anywhere. If he can get preferential treatment in China for Tesla he will secure multiyear growth without interruption. However, he has 0 leverage in China, and CCP has handily shown him how easily they can push his business around there, should they wish to.\n\nIn short, the *quid pro quo* here is for Musk to acquire TWTR and effectively sell the public discourse to CCP in exchange for leverage in the Chinese market. In other words, he now has something to trade with CCP to gain a position of strength over there (e.g. blocking any other western EVs, or at the very least allowing him to grow without 'crackdowns'). As long as he provides access to CCP to TWTR to spread their misinformation, he can keep doing business in China.\n\nHence why the whole bullshit around 'free speech' in twitter, which he suddenly became passionate about. This is double-speak for allowing more misinformation unchecked. Likewise about the push to reduce dependance on advertising, because they would kick back to any favoritism to China. Without market levers against him (advertising revenue and public company - he wants to get rid of both) he will reign supreme to change things in TWTR so that he accommodates Chinese interests.\n\nMusk is a businessman and has 0 interest in free speech and whatnot, he is just looking after his long term business interests, and he will trade off free speech for access to the chinese market.\n\nBullish on TSLA I guess",

    "title": "The Real Reason Elon Musk Bought Twitter and why that is a HUGE PROBLEM!",
    "selftext": "# Elon Musk bought Twitter for one reason and only one reason,\n\n# TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE!!!!\n\nLets take a look at the facts, and as I lay them out, it should become fairly obvious why this will be fucking terrible for all of man kind. Then we will examine the best fiscal path forward.\n\n* First we already know TESLA is making robots, so it is fairly obvious that the he is aiming for AI technology.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TESLA ROBOT](https://preview.redd.it/ehsrrlaptcw81.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718fd6d8e0c54463ef765f4bdbe059773bc18dd7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Second- Elon Musk watched the Movie 'Ex Machina' so we can clearly deduce that he knows one of the keys to creating AI is having access to a enormous amount of data(twitter). See the below Script Analysis from Scott Myers for reference.\n\n\" *61\u201364 Nathan shows Caleb his lab where he makes the AIs. He explains that he managed to crack the problem of creating a convincing face by hacking into all the cameras on peoples\u2019 iPads, phones etc and using that data. He goes on to show a brain, like that inside Ava, made from structural gel that holds its form for memories but shifts for thoughts. The software for the AIs is \u2018blue book\u2019 which is Nathan\u2019s (Google-like) search engine company, that tells the AI how people think \u2014 thought patterns, impulsivity etc \u2014 more than what they are interested in. Nathan says he wanted to show Caleb all this to remind him that Ava is just a computer, a grey box, with no gender.* [SOURCE](https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-ex-machina-part-1-scene-by-scene-breakdown-25ebd7b2777d)\n\n\"Ok.... you are probably thinking \"so fucking what?!?\" Well wait there is more. Now check out this math I did.\n\n# $TWTR + $TSLA + Starlink = Terminator\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SKYNET = STARLINK](https://preview.redd.it/7flhx3vfucw81.jpg?width=299&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=953a47a43f6959e740da23f653a6dfb666a0ba4a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[STARLINK = SKYNET](https://preview.redd.it/zyseusosucw81.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f13a96d1d5fe0aed2a0ac5d4f3ac164c79a0a5e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe combination of SpaceX(Starlink), TESLA, and TWITTER will lead to the rise of TERMINATORS! Machines designed to eradicate human beings.  If you are still not connecting the dots, you are probably fucked anyway, leave this post and go back to facebook.\n\nFor those of you still paying attention let me drop some more knowledge bombs on you and then we can have a serious discussion about what we need to do about this....\n\n* It is entirely possible Elon is a Terminator, I mean who the fuck names a kid X \u00c6 A-12 ? I am not going into all the other supporting facts supporting this right now, but it is possible because Terminators time travel.\n* Starlink is designed to be a literal net of satellites in the sky a fucking SKYNET(in case you needed some spelling instead of math)\n* SpaceX is teaming up with the military just like Starlink does.\n* Neuralink (mind control)\n* Boring Company (tunneling robots)\n* Examine all the Terminator names: They all Start with letters just like Teslas , T-1000 , T-8000 , shit one of them is even called a Series - H, now tell me that does not sound like Tesla! [SOURCE](https://screenrant.com/terminator-movies-machines-every-model/)\n\n\"**The US military is teaming up with Elon Musk's SpaceX to build a rocket capable of delivering weapons around the world at 7,500 mph**. The plans call for a rocket that can carry 80 metric tons of cargo into space and land anywhere in the world in about an hour. \" [SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/musks-spacex-partners-us-military-to-deliver-weapons-by-rockets-2020-10)\n\n\"Upon connection to the secure military network, Skynet spread itself further, locking out human operated systems, and quickly took control of every weapon system that it came into contact with. Only then did its creators realize that the virus *was* Skynet. Exactly one hour later, at 6:18 PM, Skynet launched the American nuclear missiles at their target sites across the world. The ensuing nuclear holocaust wiped out three billion human lives in what was to be known as \"Judgment Day\". [SOURCE](https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/Skynet)\n\n* I also asked the smartest person I know [u/VisualMod](http://user/VisualMod) , and he said and I quote: \"this was all totally possible and 97.1523486% likely to happen.\"Fucking boom! Microphone Drop on your face!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](f1vcjww6vcw81 \"\\\"This is all totally possible and 97.1523486% likely to happen.\\\" ----u/VisualMod\n\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it, we are all fucked now, all thanks to Elon Musk who is 97.1523486% likely to be a Terminator. So what do we do? Nothing in the short term, depending on how the secret time traveling wars play out, we could be a decade or more from actual Judgment Day. There is also a 2.8476514% chance that this will not happen and Elon is not a Terminator, so if you play FDs you are used to worse odds and  should probably just fuck off as per usual.\n\nI am going to stay in the market until I see certain signs:\n\n* When TESLA Robots Division reaches 3 Million deliverables per year\n* Serious AI integration between Twitter and the US military emerges\n* US Military Begins Purchase of Autonomous TESLA Tanks\n* SpaceX merger with LockHeed Martin\n\nIf you see any of these things happening, go cash gang asap and head for a bunker in the hills, after the fallout maybe you can join the resistance and help bringdown Starlink.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*this is not financial advice, this is the fate of humanity\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nPositions: I am definitely not telling any of you quacks the coordinates of my bunker.",

    "selftext": "I know they are down 80% from their ATH ($172 on 11-16-21) just after IPO...and have lost 50% over the past 3 months.  So much FOMO from people that feel like they missed out on TSLA.  Insanity.\n\n  \nAnyways, can they really keep falling?  The answer is Yes.  About 30 more dollars to go.  The hits are about to really start landing.  \n\nThe biggest catalysts for a short term drop: \n\n1) end of lockup period on 05-09-22.  Ford alone owns 100M shares (about 11% of RIVN) and has already scrapped their plans to build an EV with them thinking they can go it alone.  I'm not sure why they would keep their investment in what is now the only real truck EV competitor around.  They want to see Rivian fail.  The only way they stay involved is if they stage a takeover.  But I don't think they have deep enough pockets to pull it off (not to mention F's mountain of debt and their own ambitious EV plans that are very capital intensive)\n\n2) earnings report next week.  They are going to show horrible delivery numbers for Q1 and the forecast will also be terrible.  Supply chain, competition, yadda yadda, macro environment, covid, war, whatever.  The worst part is that they have also committed to honoring initial reservation prices for all the people that have pre-ordered...at their very modest run rate, this effectively guarantees they will be selling EVs at a loss for at least the next 3 years of production.  AT LEAST.  Like they said previously, they may never be profitable.  Amen brother.\n\n3) I'm just waiting for Cramer to be giddy about them and then the nail is really in the coffin.  \n\n\nThe only thing that will save them in my not so humble opinion is if AMZN decides to buy them.  That's the only thing that keeps me from not going balls deep\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 20 x $30p Exp 12-16-22  \n\n\nYes, yes, I know it's not a weekly YOLO.  Humor me",

    "title": "HIMX - Quality DD and Earnings Outlook",
    "selftext": "Retard Warning: a lot of big words and numbers are to follow. I ate all my crayons already and my wife's boyfriend only uses paint because he's sophisticated, so try to pay attention. \n\nWhat is it?\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) is a semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nHIMX is scheduled to release their Q2 earnings pre-market on Thursday, May 12. Expected earnings are about $0.70 and HIMX set their range fro .67-.73. Given that they have a proven track record of beating expectations, I highly suspect the earnings results to come in around $0.75. During Q1, HIMX had a return on equity of 64.29% and a net margin of 28.24%. They also had revenue of $451.90 million during the quarter. These are all good signs. \nThe company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.05, a fifty-two week low of $8.53 and a fifty-two week high of $17.30. The stock has a 50 day moving average price of $10.36 and a two-hundred day moving average price of $10.96. Their market capitalization sits at around $1.66 billion, and a P/E ratio of 3.80. More good signs.\nThe company's revenue shot up 74% in 2021 to $1.55 billion, while gross margin increased to a record 48.5% from 24.9% in 2020. \n\nHere's the kicker, HIMX has a 5Y beta value of 2.01!\nFor all you retards that have read this far and don't know what that means: Beta is a measure of risk commonly used to compare volatility The S&amp;P 500 Index is the base for calculating beta with a value of 1.0. Securities with betas below 1 have historically been less volatile than the market. While securities with betas above 1, have historically been more volatile than the market. The beta is calculated using data over a 5-year period. Just for comparison purposes Apple's beta is 1.19 and Tesla is 2.11. \n\nWhat do the big boys think?\nA number of hedge funds have recently built up their holdings of HIMX. Morgan Stanley grew its stake in Himax Technologies by 243.6% in the second quarter. Marshall Wace LLP bought a new stake in Himax Technologies in the fourth quarter worth $4,830,000. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. boosted its holdings in Himax Technologies by 293.2% in the fourth quarter and acquired an additional 217,129 shares in the last quarter. State Street Corp boosted its holdings in Himax Technologies by 17.1% in the fourth quarter. Finally, BlackRock Inc. boosted its holdings in Himax Technologies by 59.3% in the fourth quarter. 26.96% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors.\n\nHIMX has a price target set at $11 by Nomura. This tells me that the current price, just like the rest of the market, is on sale. Right now, HIMX is trading at just\u00a03.5 times trailing earnings and 0.99 times sales. So right now looks like a no-brainer, even for a bunch of retards. Their rapid growth should be sustainable for a long time to come, as it is serving several fast-growing markets - TVs, smartphones, notebooks, tablets, automotive touchscreens, and virtual reality devices.\n\nWhat to do?\nI don't care. I'm not your mother. Buy shares because it's poised for a bull run. Try to time the options trades right with earnings this week, because it's super volatile and it could sky rocket. Eat more crayons and dream of what life would be like if Papa Elon didn't just crush your bank account because you lost all your money on TSLA calls. \n\nPositions - don't have any. I do this shit for fun. I'm old and boring and put all my $ in lame-ass mutual funds because I want to retire one day.\nBut here, have a rocket \ud83d\ude80",

    "selftext": "Cathie Wood\u2026 one of the most aggressively hated figures, right up there with Elon, Cramer, Citadel, Elizabeth Warren, and anyone who posts something you don\u2019t personally agree with. \n\nI\u2019ve been watching this for a while. While some of you are free of this criticism, I do feel that the vast majority of comments are vile, gross, misogynistic, and ignorant. People hate her for the wrong reasons, and that\u2019s more about your sad lot in life than about her being a bad money manager. \n\nShe\u2019s an entitled suburban career finance professional who said she started ARK because the Holy Spirit told her to. She donates a ton of money to conservative causes. She\u2019s arrogant, self aggrandizing, and apparently her #1 supporter is going to federal pound-him-in-the-ass prison for racketeering. None of that is cool with me. In many ways, Cathie is the opposite of who I want to be rooting for. \n\nBut this sub isn\u2019t about politics or personality. It\u2019s about motherfucking money. So let\u2019s break this down. \n\nShe puts a lot of money down on speculative shit. \n\nShe doubles down on her choices when other people tell her that\u2019s she\u2019s nuts.\n\nShe either wins big or she loses big. \n\n\u2026. So far, sounds a lot like this group of degenerates.\n\nListen, she can personally go fuck herself sideways with her anti-choice donor checks, but her concept is legit. ARK was and is innovative. It did and will make those with the risk tolerance and patience to stomach it very rich. \n\nThey publish buys and sells every day. You can buy into ARK funds or just cherry pick what you want. \n\nThe have an email every time anything goes up or down 15% or more, explaining what they think happened. \n\nThey have newsletters and a very interesting and informative podcast. \n\nTheir research teams are specialized. The people looking into genomics companies really know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about. The people looking at AI really know what the fuck they\u2019re taking about. \n\nThe only ones here who doesn\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about is you. \n\nBitch and moan about how \u201cher funds are 7,0000000% down from ATH\u201d. True. Because her fund was up 150% when S&amp;P was up 15%. The signature fund ARKK is up more in 5 years than VTI or SPY. And, this bear market has more to with how stupid the accelerated market growth was in the last several years, the logistics nightmare the COVID pandemic caused, and goddamned Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine than it does Cathie being good or bad at her job. \n\nBut but but \u201cshe got lucky with Tesla! If it wasn\u2019t for TSLA she wouldn\u2019t have anything!\u201d \n\nShut the fuck up already dude. We\u2019re all looking for that one magic stock to pop. That\u2019s why we have YOLO flair. She YOLO\u2019d into Tesla and she was right. Good. P.S. You can\u2019t bitch about Cathie AND Elon. Choose one. \n\nShe\u2019s also said since day one that these were tech, growth companies. Both tech and growth are inherently highly volatile. That\u2019s the deal. \n\nSo, I\u2019m summary, you\u2019re either an ignorant asshole who doesn\u2019t know a goddamned thing about how this shit works, or you\u2019re a sexist prick who never gets laid without your fleshlight, or you\u2019re just a curmudgeonly misanthrope who will never be happy as long as someone is living the life you were too cowardly or dumb to live yourself.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t like her. But I really don\u2019t like you either, and at least she\u2019s rich.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards, whoever you generous bastards are!\n\nEdit: this was written before the epic dumpster fire of this week.

    "selftext": "So as some retards may have noticed THE WORLD IS BURNING.\n\nAs birthrates plummet and average age skyrockets in Russia, the former Soviets are attempting to reform the hyper failed, puts for eternity USSR in an attempted dying breath tantrum that is literally destroying an entire beautiful, sovereign eastern European country and taken or destroyed the lives of tens of millions of innocent people.\n\nAs a result, the US and other Western countries (but also the East, we will get to that) are trying to take advantage of our collective cultural retardation to make us forget they printed more than 40% of all US dollars since the literal fucking Revolution in just a matter of months, and trying to blame the conflict in Ukraine for the massive and rapid inflation that is absolutely fucking obliterating everyone.\n\nAnd don't think an electric car will keep you safe. I bought a Tesla with my 2020 Tesla call profits... well, in 2020. The charging stations near me which are plentiful and had been cheap (about $7-12 for a full charge from 0) have mostly either doubled in price, or the chargers that were already expensive have gone up about 10-30%, so it it everyone.\n\nBut one way, I'm positive among many way coming as someone who swing traded LMT calls when the war started, to make money from the endless war crimes and ceaseless, ever expanding flooded ocean of human misery is mother fucking\n\n*FOOD MOTHER FUCKER*\n\nYou know who the fuck makes the most GODDAM MOTHER FUCKING WHEAT IN THE FUCKING WEST?\n\n\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa [RUSSIA BITCH](https://youtu.be/U06jlgpMtQs) \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\n\nChina and India may be the largest wheat producers, but adjust for population and exports, and BOOM, [Russia is now at the FAR top of the list](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_wheat_production_statistics) in wheat production. And they are BY FUCKING SUPER FAR the largest wheat exporter, followed by the US and Canada and France, and then... [oh my what's that at number 5?](https://www.worldstopexports.com/wheat-exports-country/) UKRAINE\n\n\nBut, oh no, over 1000 companies and countless countries have [pulled out of ](https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/almost-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain) or [sanctioned](https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/byvrjenzmve/) Russia.\n\nNow, you've likely been too busy sniffing crayons and then using your wax filled mucus to draw lines on charts begging TSLA to go to $1200 every single Friday by 3pm before you get closed out automatically at max loss by Robinhood to know this, but the Ukraine is actually a GOLDEN OCEAN OF WHEAT PRODUCTION, some of the most fertile farming land in the geographic area, and Russia wants that sweet sweet wheat. \n\nBut how in the fuck does this affect you, you 20-something losing $5,000 a month of student loan and credit card debt while claiming you're an \"options trader\" on your pathetic white boy Tinder profile you still pay for super likes and extra swipes on just to keep getting rejected, because you lost all knowledge of how to talk about anything but how you're the next Michael Burry since even your wife's boyfriend couldn't afford to care for you anymore as inflation even fucked HIS hard working middle class Cock and wallet?\n\nWell, last time you tried to use food stamps to get scratch off tickets at Walmart you may have noticed that food prices have gone up. Like, a fucking LOT, I'm not even gonna source this shit. You fucking know.\n\nWell, a good amount of the American diet is sugar, bread, corn and FUCKING WHEAT.\n\nActually, it's MOST OF THE WORLD'S FUCKING DIET AT THIS POINT.\n\n\nSo, I'm tired and gotta go beg my wife for $25 to buy far OTM calls expiring tomorrow in hopes of futures miraculously flipping and our 5th consecutive red month being the last one, here's my point.\n\n**THERE WILL ONLY BE ENOUGH FOOD ON THE GODDAM PLANET IN 18 MONTHS FOR 6 BILLION PEOPLE**\n\nYou know negative numbers well, I'm sure. That's 1.8 billion people too few.\n\nAdd to this that we've been seeing a shortage of fertilizer for quite some time and that farm land must be cleared for YEARS to replenish soil, a practice many countries and private companies are attempting to implement the world over, and you've got a SERIOUS problem.\n\nNow, how this will affect geopolitics I won't venture to even guess at, but likely this decade ain't seen nothing yet. Wait til the 1st world TRULY becomes Cuba and Venezuela and the 3rd world all out erupts in chaos unknown to our generation, in famine akin to the Great Leap Forward, civil wars, maybe even some domestic terrorism and revolution in the West... it will not be pretty.\n\nSo, I'm long as FUCK wheat and have been for over a month now. Sorghum and Barley will likely equally be grown in excess to make up the difference. I unironically, this isn't a poor attempt at sounding like The Wolf of Wall Street, really like Lil Bites brownies, and I can tell you their quality has greatly declined in recent months, as they've gone up so fast in cost from 1.99 to 3.60 in cost that last week the shelf literally still had the 2.49 price sticker on as I picked up a box, while an employee came to change it to 3.60 and the previous price was NOT honored.\n\nThis is 100% my bullshit conjecture, but id guess they're experimenting with using less flour.\n\nGlobal wheat prices  jumped 26%[26%](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/wheat) a tonne just since the start of the Invasion of Ukraine. This includes Chinese, Canadian, Indonesian, Australian, and even American wheat, among other major producers. This shit might be getting priced in, but I doubt the true scale of this is going to be realized for quite some time\n\nSo, I have found the biggest wheat growing companies that are publically traded, and bought LEAPS on them. These include among smaller names I can't mention MGPI, AGRO, BG, and ADM\n\nDo what you want, this is super shit DD because I don't want to super elaborate right now. Will likely edit and add more but this isn't financial advice, I'm fucking literally working in a Chinese restaurant at night because I spent my moonshotgmeandamc  money too quickly like i was gonna be rich forever, and the money I make from selling weekly covered calls is no longer enough to stay on track to cover my and my family's costs of living plus accumulate more shares and other stocks for my projected goal, so I am literally a retard who made a fuckton in 2020 and 2021 from WSB retard plays and lost or spent all but 20% of the gains at this point, and also got wiped by taxes on the gains from 2021 I got that I didn't even have enough money for without triggering a way bigger tax bill next year when things will be worse by selling more shares, and LITERALLY had to go get a job in a restaurant to supplement my income from selling weekly CCs and support my FD gambling habit, so ABSOKUTELY DO NOT FUCKING LISTEN TO ME, DO ACTUAL FUCKING DD \n\nBut in short\n\n\n*TL;DR*\n\n **THERE WONT FUCKING BE ENOUGH FOOD IN 17 MONTHS SO GET READY FOR THE REST OF THE 2020s TO BE SOME SERIOUS FUCKING SHIT**\n\n**RUSSIA AND UKRAINE AND IRAN EXPORT MOST OF THE WHEAT BUT THATS OBVIOUSLY FUCKED**\n\n**I AM BUYING FUCKING STOCK AND LEAPS IN MAJOR WHEAT, BARLEY, SORGHUM AND AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE FUCKING FAMINE**\n\n\nPositions: Farmland Partners Inc 11/18 $10C, 6/17 $15C, 11/18 $15C\n\nBG 1/19/24 $100C , BG 11/18/22 $100C, BG 11/18/22 $120C\n\n\nMGPI 6/17 $100C, MGPI 12/16/22 $105C\n\nADM 5/20 $90C\n\nAnd others but they're too small to mention on here",

    "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nGreetings you filthy animals! I'm the guy who made this [Inverse Cramer Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/) (which is beating the S&amp;P by 20% YTD, not to brag...). I asked what you wanted to see next in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/), and the top comment was a portfolio invested in stocks mentioned on South Park. So I sent my wife out for a nice date night with her boyfriend and got to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Question**\n\nCould a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Or is it?](https://i.redd.it/uw8lbkyqz1z81.gif)\n\n**The Data**\n\nI originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Strategy**\n\nBeing mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Positions**\n\n| 2000-12-13|\u2018DENN' || 2000-12-13 | \u2018DENN' || 2001-11-07 | \u2018DIS' || 2003-04-30 | \u2018CPB' |\n\n| 2004-11-03 | \u2018WMT' || 2006-10-04 | \u2018BBY' || 2008-03-19 | \u2018CHH' || 2008-04-16 | \u2018SBUX' |\n\n| 2008-10-29 | \u2018BBY' || 2009-03-11 | \u2018DIS' || 2009-03-25 | \u2018AXP' || 2009-10-07 | \u2018CMG', \u00a0'MCD', \u00a0'TWTR' |\n\n| 2009-10-21 | \u2018WWE' || 2009-11-04 | \u2018HOG' || 2010-03-24 | \u2018TWTR' || 2010-10-13 | \u2018TWTR' |\n\n| 2010-11-03 | \u2018NKE' || 2010-11-10 | \u2018NKE' || 2010-11-17 | \u2018PGR' || 2011-04-27 | \u2018AAPL', \u00a0'BBY' |\n\n| 2011-05-18 | \u2018FDX' || 2011-11-02 | \u2018Red Robin' || 2012-10-03 | \u2018WMT' || 2012-10-10 | \u2018AMZN', \u00a0'UPS' |\n\n| 2012-10-31 | \u2018NKE' || 2012-11-07 | \u2018DIS' || 2013-11-13 | \u2018SNE' || 2013-11-20 | \u2018MSFT', \u00a0'SNE' |\n\n| 2013-12-04 | \u2018MSFT', \u00a0'Red Robin' || 2014-10-15 | \u2018LYFT', \u00a0'TSLA', \u00a0'UBER' || 2014-11-05 | \u2018TWTR' |\n\n| 2014-11-12 | \u2018BBY' || 2014-12-03 | \u2018TWTR' || 2014-12-10 | \u2018TWTR' || 2015-10-14 | \u2018YELP' |\n\n| 2016-09-21 | \u2018TWTR' || 2016-09-28 | \u2018TWTR' || 2017-09-13 | \u2018TWTR' || 2017-10-11 | \u2018NFLX' |\n\n| 2017-10-25 | \u2018ROST' || 2017-11-08 | \u2018BYND' || 2017-11-29 | \u2018NFLX' || 2018-12-05 | \u2018AMZN' |\n\n| 2018-12-12 | \u2018AMZN' || 2019-10-02 | \u2018AAPL', \u00a0'DIS' || 2020-09-30 | \u2018Build-A-Bear', \u00a0'VIAC' |\n\n**The Results**\n\nUm....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Move over Cathie...](https://preview.redd.it/y9mvvf9sz1z81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787394f8282dd952b361e632aaa3466d43cb5456)\n\nSouth Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&amp;P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to \"buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic.\" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIdk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?)\n\nDespite losing my grip on reality a little, this was really fun!

    "selftext": "Musk Tweets That Twitter Deal Is on Hold https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-tweets-that-twitter-deal-is-temporarily-on-hold-11652436335\n\n&gt;Elon Musk said his deal to buy Twitter Inc. [US:TWTR] was on hold pending details on the amount of fake accounts on the social-media platform, prompting a sharp slide in the company\u2019s shares in premarket trade.\n\n&gt;\u201cTwitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a tweet early Friday. He linked to a May 2 Reuters report about a recent Twitter securities filing with those statistics.\n\n&gt;Twitter shares fell nearly 20% in premarket trade.\n\n&gt;Mr. Musk, who had a $44 billion offer to buy Twitter accepted last month, had said he plans to bring a more hands-off approach on speech moderation to a company that has struggled to reconcile freewheeling conversations with content that appeals to advertisers.\n\nAnd there were people actually wondering why it wasn't free money to buy at less than the offered price...\n\nEdit - article has been updated since originally posted. Text below in case of paywall (no changes above, just adding the full text below) -\n\n&gt;Elon Musk said his deal to buy Twitter Inc. TWTR -2.19%\u25bc was on hold, raising questions about the takeover and sending shares of the messaging service lower, but he later added that he remains committed to the acquisition.\n\n&gt;\u201cTwitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,\u201d Mr. Musk said early Friday morning from his verified Twitter account. The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.82%\u25bc chief executive linked to a May 2 Reuters report about a recent Twitter securities filing with those statistics.\n\n&gt;About two hours later, he posted: \u201cStill committed to acquisition.\u201d\n\n&gt;Twitter shares fell more than 20% after Mr. Musk\u2019s first tweet but recovered somewhat after his update. Shares were recently trading at $40 in premarket trading, down 11% and well below the $54.20 a share, or $44 billion, that Mr. Musk agreed to pay for the company last month.\n\n&gt;Twitter didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n&gt;The tweets come as many big tech stocks have been falling on Wall Street, including shares of Tesla, which are down 29% over the past month. Mr. Musk is using his Tesla holdings to help fund the Twitter deal. Meanwhile, Twitter\u2019s stock price had traded below Mr. Musk\u2019s offer price as investors wondered if the deal might get reworked or not get done.\n\n&gt;Mr. Musk might be using Twitter\u2019s recent disclosure as a means to get out of or renegotiate the deal, said Daniel Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities. One reason is the impact on Tesla shares since the deal was announced. \n\n&gt;\u201cLeveraging his stock and potential sales of Tesla is a huge overhang on the stock,\u201d Mr. Ives said. \n\n&gt;Twitter said in its most recent quarterly report that by its estimates, false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its daily active users in the first three months of the year. The company reported the same figure in its February quarterly update.\n\n&gt;The social-media company warned that its estimate is based on a sampling of accounts and that \u201cthe actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.\u201d\n\n&gt;Mr. Musk had vowed to eradicate fake Twitter users and spam accounts as part of his bid to buy Twitter.\n\n&gt;Susannah Streeter, an investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there will be skepticism whether the fake accounts are the real reason for the delaying tactic. \u201cThe $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;The tweeting Friday is the latest twist in the unorthodox attempt to take over the social-media giant by the world\u2019s richest man. It began with Mr. Musk buying a large chunk of Twitter shares on the open market earlier this year as a passive investor, which soon turned into a full-fledged buyout offer, outlined in a four-paragraph letter and several text messages to Twitter\u2019s chairman.\n\n&gt;The per-share offer price of $54.20 contained a veiled reference to marijuana. The latest bombshell comes on a superstitious date: Friday the 13th. \n\n&gt;In addition to financing from Wall Street, Mr. Musk has had to sell at least $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares to fund the deal. He has also assembled a cast of 19 investors, from a Saudi prince to Silicon Valley stalwarts, to put up another $7 billion. \n\n&gt;Meanwhile, federal regulators are investigating Mr. Musk\u2019s late disclosure last month of his sizable stake in Twitter, a lag that allowed him to buy more stock without alerting other shareholders to his ownership, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter, \n\n&gt;Mr. Musk made his filing on April 4, at least 10 days after his stake surpassed the trigger point for disclosure. He hasn\u2019t publicly explained why he didn\u2019t file in a timely manner. An attorney for Mr. Musk didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment.\n\n&gt;Amid Mr. Musk\u2019s takeover attempt, Twitter has been dealing with the disruptions in the digital advertising market from global economic turmoil and the war in Ukraine. The company said Thursday that it was pausing hiring and looking to cut costs. It also announced the departure of two senior executives.\n\n&gt;\u201cEffective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business critical roles,\u201d Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal wrote in a memo, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Twitter\u2019s move adds to broader upheaval in the tech industry in recent weeks in which several companies have been cutting staff and spending or slowing hiring.\n\nWonder how much he got from shorting it with derivatives before closing the position and tweeting 2 hours later, taking the upside too?

    "selftext": "I don't mean to add to the chorus of doomsayers but do believe I came across an analysis not mentioned on the financial porn channels (ie CNBC) who are quick to speak of \"peak inflation\" having already passed. I'm also not aware of any real substantive analysis of the inputs into inflation (one in particular I will return to) among the real \"pros\" but I'm not plugged into those circles so who knows... maybe they're keeping it a secret.\n\nI'm just some dude who basically won the lottery and made life changing bank on TSLA calls a few years ago and moved to Puerto Rico.... I'm actally a physician by training, not an economist, so obviously due your own research. But all the talk of inflation seems to be missing something very obvious and I'm hoping to share.\n\nI want to start by saying that inflation in my view isn't as new or scary as some will make it seem. It's simply more demand than supply which causes prices to go up. We've all seen this play out countless times--not enough PS5s or or Yeezys or concert tickets or raw materials as people want and the prices start skyrocketing. The difference between the inflation Jerome Powell (JPOW) talks about and some dude hawking Yeezys at a 500% premium to sticker price is really just how pervasive it's become in so many parts of our lives--food, energy, shelter, ie the basics.\n\nJPOW got a lot of flak for repeatedly insisting last year that inflation was \"transitory.\" **In a philosophical sense maybe he was correct--everything in life is transient said the Buddha. And everything will eventually get sorted out--but it took years to get here. It could take years to get back.**\n\n*In a more immediate sense he was speaking of supply-demand mismatches that are partly a result of \"supply chain bottlenecks\" like chip shortages that cause shortages of new cars that had spill over effect into used cars. This is definitely part of the story. But so too is the confluence of pandemic-era accommodative fiscal (stimulus) and monetary (QE, negative real rates) policies by Congress and the Fed, respectively.* Just as one example, if a family was receiving thousands in stimulus payments and child tax credits (expiring) and also saw the value of their home and retirement accounts double because the Fed kept real rates near zero while buying trillions in bonds to essentially create money then they might have been quick to go out and buy an even bigger home or take a really nice vacation--but because millions of other families were in the same boat lumber prices and airfares started to soar. And in a sense this effect really is \"transitory\" although it will likely take years to mean revert.\n\n**By the end of 2019, the S&amp;P 500 had (already buoyed by 4 previous rounds of QE since 2008) trended up to 3000 and the Nasdaq to 9000. Markets tend to overshoot and overcorrect** so short or medium term it's really anyones guess where things will bottom out but in the absence of QE and the return of higher interest rates I think we are likely to revert back to the pre-pandemic trajectory at some point. **And there's another 20-25% of correction left before we get there.**\n\nFutures are positive this morning and it will probably be a choppy road but the reason in my view markets haven't corrected harder is the hope that the Fed can somehow engineer a \"soft landing,\" or in other words avoid having to engineer a recession to get asset prices back in line. This will be difficult for a number of reasons that are not a secret: The conflict in Ukraine has further accelerated the multiyear supercycle in commodity prices (if you look back in history, commodities invariably go through multiyear periods of extended boom followed by cyclical bust) **that was already underway. Furthermore, extended Covid-related lockdowns in China will cause further supply disruptions and costs increases.**\n\n**And now with all this in context I finally get to the crux of my post:** While the markets are probably pricing in Ukraine and the China-lockdowns and the probably of two 50 basis point increase in interest rates, **the Fed will likely be under even greater pressure to raise interest rates more and possibly faster than markets are already expecting while also drawing down their massive balance sheet for one rarely discussed reason:**\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm)\n\nWe use the BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the primary gauge of inflation. **In the CPI, there are two components of housing costs: owners\u2019 equivalent rent of residence (OER) and rent of primary residence, which combined are 40 percent of core CPI**, which is the most widely watched because it excludes volatile energy and food prices.\n\nHowever, these are not real-time metrics. Unlike milk which people buy often, people enter into longterm leases and as such the BLS (the government agency that publishes the monthly CPI) divides into 6 cohorts. For the May measure, which will be released in the second week of June, the will ask 1/6th of respondents how much they pay in rent despite the fact that most of respondents entered leases during the pandemic when before wages and home prices started to skyrocket and the measure will be artificially lower.\n\nAn even larger component of the 40% than actual rent is owners\u2019 equivalent rent of residence (OER).\\*\\*The methodology is beyond the scope but basically because BLS considers homes investments rather than consumption so uses an indirect metric rather than asking about actual expenses like maintenance or **mortgage rates (which are rising and not captured)** or taxes. I'm going to defer to a group of economists much smarter than me to explain. One is Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary, Chief Economist for the World Bank, and President of Harvard. This research is supported by multiple others and I will post a longer lit review if enough interest but probably suffice to say this is solid research by world leading scholars with no obvious interest in manipulating markets or selling anything and much more helpful than whatever equity research department at Goldman says.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29795)\n\n&gt;\"\\[Last year\\] home prices have jumped by 19.9 percent according to Zillow. The Zillow Observed Rent Index has increased 14.9 percent, and the CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index, likely to be a particularly good leading indicator for OER, had risen by 12 percent in December...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dolmas &amp; Zhou (2021) documents that historically the BLS measure of 12-month change in rental prices is more strongly correlated with the 12-month change in housing prices observed 16 months earlier than any more recent reading \\[see [https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2021/0824)\\]...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Using a variety of techniques and datasets, we estimate housing\u2019s contribution to 2022 inflation as almost incompatible with a swift return to trend inflation.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I don't think the 16 month delay is definitive but needless to say the CPI data we are looking at is VERY STALE and at least a year old. While we may say headlines about airplanes fares (only 0.5% of the CPI) we forget that 40% of core CPI measures direct and indirect rents over a year ago and won't capture any decreases until 2023 at the earliest. For this reason, it is my view that the Fed will be under pressure well into next year to continue to raise rates and push markets further down to eventually mean revert to pre-pandemic levels.**\n\nSo what to do?\n\n**C.R.E.A.M. (Cash Rules Everything Around Me aka Delever)**. Even if the scenario of a Fed being more Hawkish than currently priced somehow doesn't pan out the risk-reward profile of markets at present is not favorable in my view. **Keep a lot of cash on hand**. Even if you're still convinced GME is the greatest thing since sliced bread, keep some cash. **Remember that high beta growth stocks are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates since their valuation depends in part on very far out csh flows that need to be discounted to present at a higher cost of capital.**\n\nAlso **consider hedging**. Put options might be an obvious play but also consider (and I usually hate ETFs)  like and ETF that is short ARKK or SOGU (which is short SPACS) or an ETF short emerging markets (which tend to get hit even worse than the US when rates rise quickly) or an ETF short the US housing market on a forward basis... not 16 months delayed like the CPI.\n\nAnd **diversify**. Sounds like boring boomer advice and the energy trade has become crowded but the energy sector and underlying commodities remain attractively priced in my view. Yes you would have ignored me 6 months ago and that \"would have been the time to buy\" but with PEs of 10s and low price to book and sky high dividends and buybacks this sector remains attractive in the face of rising inflation for the next few years until everything gets sorted out. Remember that commodities tend to rise in supercycles that last years and it's possible we're just getting started.",

    "selftext": "Before Q1 2019 Twitter used to report to numbers for MAU (Monthly active users) and mDAU ( monetizable daily active users) but later they stopped reporting MAU\n\nLet's see the difference :\n\nThis is from 2019 Q1 which was the last time MAU been reported :\n\n* MAU: 330M\n* mDAU: 134M\n\nBig difference between two numbers (196M or 59%) which means monetizable  is only 40% of total MAU\n\nLet's see the definition of **Monetizable users**\n\n&gt;We define monetizable daily active usage or users (mDAU) as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise **authenticated and accessed Twitter on any given day** through Twitter.com or Twitter applications **that are able to show ads**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Additionally, **our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology** and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies\n\n**MAU definition**\n\n&gt;We define monthly active usage or users (MAU) as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered third-party applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement.

    "selftext": "The S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, which gauges the performance of securities meeting sustainability standards, has seen its annual rebalancing this month.\nEven though S&amp;P 500 follows only major companies, some companies are ahead of their competitors and the rebalancing resulted in the removal of some components, while new companies were added to the index.\nAmong the companies removed as a part of the rebalancing was also the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle (EV) maker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nElon Musk\u2019s carmaking giant was removed from the index because it was \u201cpushed further down the ranks relative to its global industry group peers,\u201d said Maggie Dorn, Senior Director and Head of ESG Indices, North America at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.\n\n\nEven though Tesla\u2019s S&amp;P DJI ESG Score was stable on an annual basis, several factors that changed its score in the index included \u201ca decline in criteria level scores related to Tesla\u2019s (lack of) low carbon strategy and codes of business conduct,\u201d added Dorn.\nFurthermore, other factors such as reports of racial discrimination and inadequate working conditions at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, as well as the way the carmaker dealt with the NHTSA investigation after numerous deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot cars, also contributed to the decline in Tesla\u2019s S&amp;P DJI ESG Score.\n\nhttps://m.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heres-why-was-tesla-removed-from-the-sp-500-esg-index-432SI-2827307",

IMO the only way through the inevitable supply crisis is some sort of gas stimulus, at the moment the average American consumes 500 gallons of gas a year and [average price has gone up from 3.27](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gas-costs-hundreds-more-for-average-american/) to [4.56](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) in 6 months. Average salary is 50k, so that is 1.3% of people's money, at some point people will start demanding wages to go up which is going to make wage/price spiral worse. In a way, it's going to make sense to subsidize gas to stop energy from contributing to wage/price spiral. But even if it didn't make sense, it's an election year and politicians are going to want an excuse to give shit away\n\nAnd I mean we're already seeing [different forms of gas stimulus](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/us/gas-tax-cuts.html), it's not gonna help supply but sure [why not make it rain](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/04/29/2022-gas-stimulus-checks/9585306002/?gnt-cfr=1)\n\nNormal supply/demand dictates that if u have a fixed supply and increasing demand, price goes up until demand destruction. Oh gee I wonder what's gonna happen to price if governments are gonna do everything they can to avoid demand destruction by subsidizing it.\n\nOXY's last earnings 1.5B on 60B market cap. That's god damn 10 p/e. Look up any oilco and you'll see the same shit. Hella profits. Look at oil futures for any date to 2027. The entire curve is lifting every day.\n\nAlso Warren Buffet sat on a massive cash horde thru the mega bull run of 2020, and he is literally [yolo'ing the top of this chart](https://www.reuters.com/business/berkshire-buys-more-occidental-shares-boosts-stake-152-2022-05-05/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69bomgezg8091.png?width=3362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c994d038700b055a5a38ee07cf1839d4513a3e9\n\nThere are gonna be a lot of plays to make in this space, let us discuss and make money again\n\nPOSITIONS 24k Jan OXY 65c",

Previously, when Biden was engaged in the new energy plan, he met with many auto giants, but Musk, the only person who did not see Tesla, and the U.S. government's various investigations into Tesla and Musk have never stopped, including His investment in Twitter. Of course, these measures against Tesla are also under the legal framework of the United States.\n\n**In the past 24 hours, Tesla has suffered two more shocks.**\n\nFirst, according to the Wall Street Journal, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) disclosed on Wednesday that it had launched a special investigation into a crash involving a Tesla vehicle that killed three people, The accident vehicle is confirmed to be a 2022 Tesla Model S. The NHTSA is investigating more than 30 suspected serious crashes involving Tesla vehicles using the Autopilot feature. A number of other Tesla crashes have also resulted in fatalities, NHTSA records show. Tesla (TSLA.O) did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSecond, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced on the 18th that it had removed Tesla from its S&amp;P 500 ESG Index for reasons including racial discrimination and accidents related to Tesla\u2019s autopilot system.\n\nAccording to reports, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced that in addition to kicking Tesla, Delta Air Lines and Chevron out of the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, it will also add Twitter and Phillips 66 Holdings to the index.\n\nThe factors that led to Tesla\u2019s removal from the index included Tesla\u2019s failure to release details about its low-carbon strategy or code of business conduct, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 North America head of ESG indices, Donne, said in an interview. Dorn also said that while Tesla's products help reduce carbon emissions, Tesla's other issues and lack of disclosure relative to its peers should give hope to judge the company's performance through environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Investors took notice.\n\nTesla has previously called the ESG measurement methodology \"fundamentally flawed.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted back after hearing the news: \"Exxon Mobil is ranked in the S&amp;P 500 Global Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Top 10, while Tesla is not listed.

Looking back at the news released earlier, it may be the reason.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla is no longer the No. 1 holding in Cathie Wood's flagship fund. For at least most of 2017, Tesla (TSLA.O) has been the No. 1 stock in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) by market capitalization, according to the data. That changed on Thursday, when electronics maker ROKU (ROKU.O) took over from Tesla. ARKK's stake in Tesla was worth about $703 million as of Thursday's close, while its Roku stake was worth $717 million.\n\nAs previously reported, Tesla was removed from the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index by S&amp;P. In response, Margaret Dorn, director of ESG indices for North America, explained that Tesla was excluded from the index because the company did not publish details about its low-carbon strategy or code of business conduct, although Tesla Pulling electric vehicles could help reduce global emissions. But the company's other problems and fewer disclosures have caught investors' attention.",

She's very upset.\n\nI know you want to blow Elon on the way to Mars because he's the greatest. I get it. \n\nI mean, I don't want to fellate the man, but I like a lot of what he does and believe in the companies he is trying to build.\n\nBut here are the facts:\n\nCar sales went off the charts during the pandemic. How many cars do you have? 1? 2? You don't buy 17. So demand is going to be lower than usual.\n\nThe Fed has, and will continue to, raise rates. You know what that fucks up? Financing for cars. It's more expensive and harder to secure. So demand will be lower than usual.\n\nYou know what's not lower than usual? All the shit it takes to make a car. Thanks to supply chain issues, production is not going to blast off. So, even if there were magical demand from somewhere, you can't buy a car.\n\nYou know what's getting fucking destroyed by inflation and will get destroyed by the recession? Consumer discretionary spending. That's the money people use to buy cars.\n\nI'm not going to get into TSLA's suss earnings or the specific issues of the overly fragmented EV market that can also fuck with TSLA (have a look at the fragmented car market when cars first hit the market to see how that goes).\n\nShort term, it's just a fucking stupid stock to have. \n\nYeah. Yeah. Stonks go ups! I hold 4vr!\n\nIf your plan is to hold through this rough patch for absolutely no reason when you could sell and rebuy more shares... well, that's a choice. \n\nFair enough. You're just going to have to parrot that \"Stocks always go up\" shit for a decade until they do. \n\nIf you think the bottom is the problem, you need to start worrying about how fucking long the recovery is going to take.\n\nFor whoever is a smarty pants who is going to suggests DCAing on the way down. Cool. You're the pumpkin spice latte of investing, Basic bitches love you.\n\nJust hold some of your cash until TSLA is done shitting its pants.\n\nYou know what makes people lose everything in a crash? It's not just the crash. It's people who buy the dip to early and too big then have to wait 14 years with everything invested to see a positive return.\n\nDon't be that dumb fuck. You're better than that. \n\nNo go tell your mother you're sorry.",

Though, I believe this wasn\u2019t the worst decision. \nThe company does not have the infrastructure to properly maintain and charge vehicles. \nThis has caused an uproar with employees.

Lol\n\nThis also explains his recent tweet to get TSLA lawyered up, since he's the decider on both sides of the transaction.

No one in their right mind will make him relinquish control of the combined company. Who the hell would they find to replace him?\n\nSolar City hardly had a great business case and predictably flopped.

    "title": "Volatility and You: How Underhedging Creates Crashes",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR**: The market is, in general, underhedged. Lack of hedging with put options is creating a scenario that makes our ability to rally upward much harder and increases crash risk. Buy short-dated ATM straddles (more risky), buy puts, directly short the S&amp;P 500 (less risky), or stay in cash (not really risky at all) (see \"How to position yourself\").\n\n---\n\n&gt; *SINK RATE! SINK RATE!*\n\n\\- Boeing 787 MAX TAWS, being piloted by Captain Powell\n\n---\n\nLet's talk about options! The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) has the most liquid options market in probably the world. Now sometimes people, instead of using these derivatives for gambling based on what side of a yard a dog poops on, use them to hedge their exposures to stocks and the market. \n\nThey are bought and sold by market makers (Citadel's the king, obviously, but there are others). People (in general) buy put options and sell call options. Sometimes though, there are speculators who would buy call options and sell put options (think WSB, thetagang, your grandfather's pension, etc).\n\nMarket makers want to do one thing: capture the spread between the bid and the ask price. They don't care about short ladders or whatever. They'll happily be long or short SPX, GME^[1], TSLA, whatever if it makes them more money.\n\nIn order to hedge their exposure to the movement of stock price action (gamma), volatility (vanna), and time (charm), they buy and sell /ES (S&amp;P futures) to hedge to their delta^[2].\n\nIf dealers are negatively exposed to *gamma*, things get a bit volatile but if dealers get negatively exposed to *vanna*, things get real volatile real fast because they are selling into selling (which increases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) and buying into buying (which decreases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) in order to hedge.\n\nTo explain with a simple analogy: that crazy ex, she's vanna. Vanna will take you to your highest highs but will also take you to your lowest lows. And... yeah those lows will be low. And no, I'm not going to help you \"get over\" her. And by the way, my bf is coming over for the week so we'll need the house.\n\nBack to options.\n\nIt's worth noting that dealers quote their options in *volatility* terms, not dollars and cents^[3]. But implied volatility is relatively low for a 1000 point drop right now and [*isn't increasing as we drop*](https://i.imgur.com/ct8TGaJ.png).\n\nThis is because there are a lot of people systematically selling puts, driving down IV. And because IV is being driven down by the put sellers, bulls can't get a sustained bear market rally (since these rallies are often fueled by rehedging)\n\nBut it's pretty obvious to anyone who's traded that realized volatility has far outstripped implied volatility (especially on the \"FDs\") and that FDs are relatively cheap. VIX is 29 right now, which implies about a 2%ish (off the top of my head) move each day. We're getting multi percent intraday moves, even if close-to-close we're going relatively slow. *This is absurd.*\n\nI could go on but you get the point already so let's move on.\n\n# How to position yourself\n\nSo... there are a couple ways you can play this relatively historic event depending on your risk tolerance (from most risky to least risky)\n\n1. **Buy straddles extremely close to expiration, especially on days with large intraday moves.** Because IV is chronically underpriced here, you should be able to make money buying 0 DTE straddles. Don't use Robinhood or anything like that, they'll screw you over by market selling your position early. Also don't do it systematically, because you will lose out when you don't get the move you want.\n2. **Buy somewhat longer term put options.** SPX 6/21 3800p (SPY 6/21 380p) is probably a decent option and has a decent chance of going ITM. You can sell on a volatility spike or keep them going into expiration.\n3. **Keep hitting those tails.** 3\u03c3 30 DTE SPY put options (it's currently SPY 6/21 305p) are only 13bps ($0.50). On a massive move, those tails will explode in value. You're not going for them going ITM, you're going for P/L so you can unload your bags onto Citadel. Buy them when VIX is in the 20s.\n4. **Short E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures (/ES or /MES) or SPY or something.** This will be probably the least gut wrenching thing to do. You'll make a lot of money, but you probably won't get a heart attack in 20 years from the stress of watching options change rapidly in value. So... it has its downsides. Wait for a large volatility blow up (look at VIX) or for Fed to reverse course to unload your position.\n5. **Go cashgang.** Sure you'll miss out on gains, but you'll only decay at 8%/year vs. the 30%+ drop (+ decaying at 8%/year). You can [place $10k into I-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) if you're worried about inflation at an interest rate of 9.62% *risk-free*.\n\n(My positions are #4 and a bit of #3 opportunistically.)\n\nGood luck WSB, you're gonna need it.\n\n# Some anticipated criticism\n**But volatility is heteroskedastic!**\n\nYour criticism here is basically that IV doesn't move 1-to-1 with SPX and while that's true, realized volatility is still above implied volatility (VIX should be like in the 40s). But implied volatility is still implying that there isn't hedging and a deeper analysis reveals that in general, there are a lot of put sellers.\n\nThere's also a pretty well established inverse correlation in SPX with IV in general (although don't naively apply this to single stocks, especially ones like GME). \n\n**But volatility should be low for a sustained drop!**\n\nSure but volatility isn't constant and is based on a few things including how \"\"\"fearful\"\"\" the market is. And even so, even if we sustained a constant move down every single day (which we don't) you'd still have gamma P/L to contend with. This alone makes it so that volatility is 0 or whatever but it's also dependent on other factors here. What I'm contending here is that these factors are such that volatility is massive underpriced, especially with the massive intraday moves that we are seeing.\n\n**VIX is a bad volatility index!**\n\nYeah I know but I used it for simplicity. Anyone in the vol space knows that SPX vol and skew (not the SKEW index!) isn't being bid up all that much relatively so... yeah.\n\n# Footnotes\n1. Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options. MMs got caught offsides a bit by the January 2021 event (basically the options chain acted as if every option was 50\u0394) and the gamma profile was very negative then, as anyone who works on a desk will tell you (this is what the SEC got wrong in their report). It's an interesting happening, but it's a story for another time.\n\n2. Plus some to account for skew. Also, it's worth noting that delta-hedging exists independent of BSM. You still have to hedge for price movements, volatility, and time even if you aren't pricing your options using BSM, which practitioners don't.\n\n3. Remember that everything except for volatility and rates are known observables so these are the only two things that can really be \"priced\" per se. Something like BSM can be used to map IVs to dollars and cents.\n\n[1]: #footnotes \"Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options.

    "title": "A Retard's Guide to Market Dynamics - Why Stocks Go UP and DOWN",
    "selftext": "Here's a few concepts that will help you troglodytes understand the basic structure of the market &amp; dynamics for trading based on a Calendar. (Yes, the actual calendar dates matter)\n\n# 1st Concept: The Market Consists of Active and Passive Participants\n\n**Active Participants \"APs\",** are just that, they frequently are buying and selling in an effort to outperform a benchmark or index (Buying &amp; selling shares or options) . \n\n**Passive Participants \"PPs\"** involve less buying and selling, invest through mutual/index funds, or have an automatic schedule for purchase (i.e. 401k deposit from their paycheck) \n\nWhat does this mean? It means that **APs actually control the price**. That's why option driven equity flows are so important. APs are able to use leverage via purchasing an option contract to force option dealers to hedge via purchasing or short-selling shares of the underlying asset. (Long call - dealer buys shares. Long put - dealer short sells shares) These options have a larger effect on the underlying asset's price movement than buying shares with the same positional dollar amount. Please see this graphic below for an easy understanding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08jgmvnptf191.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cd07f17baf9b4f6918e8f74c32c04e199738fe4\n\nTo understand what happens each week, you have to know where we are on the Option Expiration Calendar. On the 3rd Friday of every month, participants (bulls &amp; bears) fight each other, **ultimately choosing the direction of the market until next month's Option Expiration Day \"OPEX\".** \n\nYou'll notice most option dates have Friday expirations between Monthly OPEX's, but most participants ultimately choose those 3rd Fridays for liquidity/volume reasons. This means that the delta-gamma hedges from option dealers are likely to \"hold\" that direction into Monthly OPEX.  Here's an example using TSLA's historic run-up in Nov-2020 to January 2021. \n\nSee this open interest \"OI\" TSLA Calls (graph below)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1achiea8qf191.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1682ee582470656a3f203ae46879483323b62d2\n\nAs you can see on 11/20 and 12/18, the OI of call options are far GREATER than other Friday expirations. On 11/20, into close the market sold off as those 11/20 \"hedges\" on call options for the bullish month of October 16th to November 20th sold off their hedges from calls purchased by APs. On this point, I don't want you to assume that this will always happen every Monthly OPEX, because there are always participants purchasing and/or selling throughout the trading session. \n\nIt's fair to assume that when options flow points heavily to the upside that this will occur - especially if the move \"squeezes\" during the week of OPEX because of the skew towards short-dated options. On the following Monday (day after OPEX), November 23, 2020, you can assume that this day is very important.... because it sets us on the train tracks into the next month's OPEX. We had a slight gap up, some volatility intra-day and a ramp into end of day. Tuesday ended green and we held that same level through the rest of the week. This was a good indication that we would continue higher through Nov to December's OPEX. It's never 100% safe to assume that a following Monday OPEX will choose the direction for the next month, as APs could find any reason to sell any moment. (i.e. war breaks out, jpow changes stance, stimulus deal, market runs too hot \\[blow-off top\\], etc.)  Coordinated selling can always drop the price, and price moving down can cause option dealers to sell hedges. \n\nIt can work both ways; as we're seeing now in the current market (put gamma causing market makers to \"short\" shares into the following opex; depressing prices). Once those puts expire, shorted shares are bought back and we \"bounce\" typically near OPEX (quad-witching week more reliable).\n\n# 2nd Concept: VIX Term Structure\n\nAre market participants betting on volatility in the near term? VIX is comprised of Call &amp; Put options on the S&amp;P 500 Index. When VIX goes up, that means participants are purchasing more put options than call options. This is a basic concept, but often overlooked. You need to tie that into concept #1 above. If P/C ratio is low. That means that more calls are being purchased \"Bulls beating Bears\"; therefore, If price moves up, then option dealers are forced to buy more shares of the underlying asset, pushing price higher.\n\n# 3rd Concept: Technical Analysis\n\nYou have to understand charting basics, volume profile, and supply &amp; demand zones. I won't get into this topic in detail since my post history covers this.\n\nYes everyone on WSB loves to shit on technicals - but the truth is anything that isn't fundamental analysis is technical analysis. Most of you guys are using TA in some form or another without even realizing it. **Effective short-term trading is done through proper risk management combined with technical analysis to identify asymmetrical trades.** Knowing about a P/E ratio will do you no good trading options weeklies.\n\nFurthermore, 99% of the people on the internet who do TA, do it completely wrong. Basically almost every single TA post on WSB is just spewing bias and nonsense. This is what gives TA such a horrible reputation around here, and why it appears to be complete bullshit. \n\nIf you want to get into real TA, don't go on YouTube or any of that bullshit - pick up a book or two. I have a few favorites, but **Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets** by John Murphy takes the cake.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n[SPY Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/40azdgx6sf191.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afa5108019232dc64a99f34cbedcb8664d7f6561)\n\nThis is a SPY trendline from the lows of 2007 which held for a decade and heralded one of the 2018 tops, as well as the 2020 top and the election top.\n\nFurthermore, breaking it spurred a rally from 357 -&gt; 480.\n\nOne thing to note about lines in TA - the more significant the points they connect (historically) - the more important they are. In the same vein, the longer the timeframe - the more important they are.\n\n# 4th Concept: Investor Sentiment\n\nAre AP's bullish, bearish, somewhere in the middle? \n\nGo to [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) and look at the fear/greed index. Sometimes outliers (extreme fear or greed) can mean we're at a local bottom or top because being \"too bullish\" can lead to profit taking (calls close/price drops) and \"too bearish\" can lead to profit taking (puts close/price bounces).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fdaleeehrf191.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b1d3f38342814abb152e84faf8c5b09aaa43b2\n\n# 5th Concept: The Changing Dynamics of Who Are the Active Participants\n\nThe growing number of active participants in the stock market is changing how it functions. Investors are using options trading more than ever before. The sheer volume is staggering. Mostly attributable to the ease of access to trading on apps like Robinhood &amp; WeBull, etc. This is why Option Driven Equity Flow discussed in 1st Concept is so important. They are moving price more than ever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13rxfuwmrf191.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec3eda8a5fd2978081312c4bf70270c353300e01\n\n*Follow the money &amp; check the calendar!*",

    "title": "Tesla going bellow $400 would margin call Elon and force him to sell 13 Million shares",
    "selftext": "By Senad Karaahmetovic:\n\nToni Sacconaghi, a Senior Analyst at Bernstein covering U.S. IT Hardware, has discussed implications for Tesla (TSLA) shares amid an ongoing saga concerning CEO Elon Musk and his deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR) for $44 billion.\n\nMusk may \u201cultimately elect or be forced to purchase Twitter going forward,\u201d Sacconaghi told clients in a note today. The analyst took note of Musk\u2019s deal to acquire Twitter which should be completed via debt, equity, and a margin loan.\n\nSacconaghi pays special attention to $12.5 billion that will come from a margin loan facility tied to Tesla stock.\n\n\u201cFollowing the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing. That said, at a TSLA share price of $621 or less, Musk would technically not be able to borrow the full $12.5B against his shares - in fact, if TSLA's stock price were to drop to $500/share, he would be ~$2.5B short. If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nHowever, the bigger - but also less probable - financial risk for Elon Musk is there is a deeper pullback in Tesla shares, in combination with him completing the deal.\n\n\u201cIf the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Elon Musk would get a margin call.\n\nSacconaghi rates Tesla with an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target as he struggles to justify TSLA's valuation, \u201cwhich appears to imply huge volume AND industry leading profitability going forward, which is historically unprecedented.\u201d\n\nTesla stock price is indicated to open 2.5% lower today, or at $657.90.\n\n[Source](https://m.uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/margin-call-alert-tesla-stock-falling-below-400-would-force-elon-musk-to-sell-13-million-shares-of-ev-maker-to-fund-twitter-deal--bernsteins-sacconaghi-2655243?ampMode=1)",

    "selftext": "EDIT:  Skip to bottom for TLDR since WSB\u2019ers aren\u2019t interested in learning to fish, they only want to eat the McFilet\n\nAre you cucks going to finally start taking your investment advice from a Golden Corral cook with a gambling problem or are you going to continue listening to clowns like Meat Breath Kevin on YT?\n\nI almost feel bad saying it because he seems like an alright guy, but all Meat Breath does is ramble about nonsense and incessantly shill his holdings and YT courses. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been giving free, specific, successful options gems. Let\u2019s review:\n\n1. I said to buy $SOFI from $7 all the way down to $5. Calls printed when it bounced off of $5. I wouldn\u2019t buy calls on much right now but $SOFI was trading at or slightly under book value a couple of weeks ago\n2. I said to buy TSLA puts at $740. I still think TSLA touches $435 before it finds support. I love TSLA as a company but it\u2019s completely overvalued and that\u2019ll hurt longs badly in this market. Period. No clue why anyone would buy TSLA calls in this environment.\n3. I said to short SNOW at $153. I said it would plummet into and after earnings Bc it\u2019s overpriced SaaS nonsense not worth $50B. It\u2019s worth about $15B-$18B, generously.\n4. I commented to short Trade Desk at $62. More overpriced shit not worth the $30B when I said short it. It\u2019s worth about $10-$12B, generously.\n\nThe list goes on. But the point is, you\u2019re cucking yourselves waiting for a rapid market turnaround. There will be no quick turnaround. There is no imminent bull rally. Say it with me - THERE IS NO IMMINENT BULL RALLY. Wall Street will continue fucking you, your wife and your wife\u2019s boyfriend as you continue buying weekly call options. Nothing else matters right now except Wall St sentiment. Say it with me - NOTHING ELSE MATTERS RIGHT NOW EXCEPT WALL ST SENTIMENT. If you can see ahead of how these guys are going to attempt to extract from you every dollar you own, you can win. \n\nWe are near a bottom for many growth stocks, but not all stocks. But that doesn\u2019t mean once we hit bottom the stock market is going to suddenly rocket upwards. All of these YouTube clowns continue perpetuating this idea. The Fed will not begin printing trillions of dollars of Monopoly money like they did in Spring of 2020. We won\u2019t be breathing a sigh of relief that a pandemic isn\u2019t ending the world as we know it. Interest rates won\u2019t be historically low. NONE of these catalysts are in place. When the stock market finally bottoms, it won\u2019t bounce back quickly. It will, quite boringly, trade sideways for probably two years. So you can either continue buying short term calls and lose all of your money (I know, it\u2019s what you all do best) or you can do the following:\n\n1. Sell weekly 10-15% OTM cash secured puts on recently destroyed growth and/or tech stocks you are okay wheeling (don\u2019t do it going into earnings unless you are going 20%+ OTM). A lot of good growth and/or tech companies are near bottom. Could they fall more? Definitely. But the falls won\u2019t be as drastic and rapid as they\u2019ve been the last 12 months. Collect some fat weekly premium from degenerates like yourself\n\n2. For the time being (this could change when Wall St decides they want to fuck you differently, perhaps the mouth instead of the ass) buy slightly ITM 30-60 DTE puts on overpriced pieces of shit right before earnings. Yes, IV will be high. But you won\u2019t be crushed when the stock moves down only 10% instead of down 20%. $SNOW today is a perfect example. This company will be trading under $100 within a few weeks. I had retards messaging me complaining that $SNOW has ONLY dropped to $114 since I recommended buying puts at $153. WAT!? How far OTM are you buying?\n\n3. Buy slightly ITM 60-120 DTE puts on plainly overvalued pieces of shit.\n\nI\u2019m trying to help you gamble successfully so that you can all come and work with me at Golden Corral. We can do cocaine on our breaks and hit up the Wendy\u2019s dumpster after work for some sweet, sweet mouth. Here\u2019s what I see as obvious plays going forward:\n\nABNB Sep 22 $120P for ~$20. Everyone is about to feel poor. Like really fucking poor. When they realize their equities aren\u2019t bouncing right back and their home value goes down 20% in value by the end of the year, nobody is going to want to spend money on an overpriced AirBNB shit shack for the week. The honeymoon period of the whole country feeling rich is ending very soon. Everyone will go back to being \u201ctemporarily\u201d poor. ABNB at a $71B valuation is laughable. \n\nDASH Oct 22 $75P for ~$18.50. This company could quite possibly be the biggest piece of shit on the stock market, and it\u2019s valued at a hysterical $24B. Gas will remain super expensive for the foreseeable future. DASH drivers were already making almost no money and now will make even less with gas so high. They are leaving in droves. The restaurants that use DASH absolutely fucking hate them. DASH has no moat. As previously mentioned, once people feel poor again they will walk their fat asses to pick up their food as opposed to paying an egregious amount to have it delivered (assuming they are tipping - always tip generously you scumbags or don\u2019t eat out. Period.) DASH is bleeding money. Like Carvana, Door Dash will be a remnant of its former self in the not-so-distant future. \n\nLI Sep 22 $25P for $5. I actually bought these when they were only $3.35, still holding, but LI is the most overvalued of the overvalued piece of shit Chinese EV companies. $23.5B for a Chinese electric vehicle company without a dedicated following, trash authoritarian government, and who IPO\u2019d in the middle of stock market mania in 2020? This piece of dogshit company screams fake Chinese accounting. It will be leveled either after TSLA plummets to sub $450 or before then. I would be hesitant to buy $LI at a $3B valuation.\n\nGood luck and fuck you.\n\nTLDR: There will be no significant bull market any time soon. Meat Kevin has become insufferable. To safely make money now buy ABNB puts, DASH puts and LI puts about 90-120 DTE",

    "title": "This is big. \"Musk sued by Twitter investors for stock 'manipulation' during takeover bid REUTERS - 1:27 PM ET 5/26/2022\"",
    "selftext": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk was sued by Twitter Inc [( TWTR )](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=TWTR) investors claiming he manipulated the company's stock price downward, as the chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla Inc [( TSLA )](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=TSLA) mounts a $44 billion takeover bid for the social media platform.\n\nThe investors said Musk saved himself $156 million by failing to disclose that he had purchased more than 5% of Twitter by March 14. They asked to be certified as a class and to be awarded an unspecified amount of punitive and compensatory damages.\n\nThey also named Twitter as a defendant, arguing the company had an obligation to investigate Musk's conduct, though they are not seeking damages from the firm.\n\nThe investors said Musk continued to buy stock after that, and ultimately disclosed in early April that he owned 9.2% of the company, according to the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in San Francisco federal court.\n\n\"By delaying his disclosure of his stake in Twitter, Musk engaged in market manipulation and bought Twitter stock at an artificially low price,\" said the investors, led by Virginia resident William Heresniak.\n\nNeither Musk nor his lawyer immediately responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe investors said the recent drop in Tesla's stock has put Musk's ability to finance his acquisition of Twitter in \"major peril\" since he has pledged his shares as collateral to secure the loans he needs to buy the company.\n\nTesla's shares were trading at around $713 on Thursday afternoon, down from above $1,000 in early April.\n\nThe timing of Musk's disclosure of his stake has already triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nThe SEC requires any investor who buys a stake exceeding 5% in a company to disclose their holdings within 10 days of crossing the threshold.\n\nThe investors also said public criticism by Musk of the company, including a May 13 tweet stating the buyout was \"temporarily on hold\" until Twitter proved that spam bots accounted for less than 5% of its users, amounted to an attempt to further drive the share price down.\n\nMusk on Wednesday pledged an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing to fund his bid for Twitter, a sign he is still working to complete the deal.\n\nMusk was sued earlier this month in Delaware Chancery Court by a Florida pension fund seeking to halt the deal on the basis that some other big Twitter shareholders were supporting the buyout, a violation of Delaware law. Heresniak's lawsuit does not seek to stop the takeover.\n\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen in New York and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Nick Zieminski and Matthew Lewis)",

    "selftext": "FNGG is a 2x leveraged ETF that gives you the advantage of taking out margin on your broker without actually taking out margin, and it accurately tracks the price of some very interesting holdings with 2x the volatility.  I think we hit the market bottom so I am personally all in on FNGG.  What is interesting are the holdings:\n\nI like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:\n\nI would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.\n\nAt the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

    "selftext": "This is going to be so difficult for your dopamine-fried brains. WSB is the land of impulsivity. Gambling on steroids. If the bet is not a 100:1 what's the point? I want to make it big NOW or lose my life and end myself.\n\nI take bets, yes. but I bet on \"surer\" things. Go big boi. you can turn a surer thing into a 100:1 return much more easily than betting on some AMC stock where the CEO seems intent on selling stock and pilfering the company. He's got the apes to cheer him on. \n\nTSLA? Omg, Elon said it was overvalued at like 1/11 of the current price before a stock split. What changed? Nothing except that the consumer is in a worse off position, there's no more stimmy and nickel prices are mooning. Mass delusion has always been prevalent in groups-&gt; just look at China. \n\nNow go grab a **cup of coffee.** Take your **bloody Adderal**. and try and get through this (less than a page). \n\n# The future\n\nMeteorologists can now forecast the weather 5-days out with an accuracy of 90%. Trying to forecast the weather 10 days out, and your accuracy rate falls to 43%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9yq4w5w86491.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbe90ca90cf91574c874db80ec2cf2428af53361\n\n  \nI believe the future of the market, the economy, and business is as difficult to predict as the weather and this is why it's so hard for me to pay dear multiples for growth stocks. Because their share prices are based so heavily on things that happen more than 10 years down the road- you need to really \u201cknow\". I believe a good price to pay for a growth stock, in a company with an obvious competitive advantage or monopoly, must be worthy to generate a 7% yield on paper. This way, if the growth flops your downside is still semi-limited.\u00a0\n\n  \nI have been taking a look at Belgium Post. It looks similar to a growth-flop story (analysts paying too high multiples for \u201cgrowth\u201d they can\u2019t accurately forecast). The weather changed, the growth stopped, and the growth investors left. They have left BPOST (Belgium Post) trading at a P/E of 4.64. EPS of 1.25 in 2021, at a share price of 5.8EUR. Annual report\u00a0[here](https://bpostgroup.com/sites/default/files/2022-04/bpost%20annual%20report%202021_EN_FIN.pdf)\n\nOpportunity is often found where nobody else is looking. Do yourself a favor and Google Search \"Belgium Post\". Absolutely no coverage on it. BIG F\\*$CING TICK BOX right there chaps. \n\n  \nThis is the story:\n\n* 2016 to 2017 Revenue grew at 23% through acquisition. Share price very happy- I believe investors forecasting continued growth.\n* 2017 to 2018 more growth- 27% Organic!! Growth investors are ecstatic\u2026(But payroll costs rose a lot, and operating margin dropped).\n* 2018-2019 no growth. On **13 March 2018,** they release an annual report. From that day share price goes from 27EUR to 7.63EUR. 72% Decrease in less than a year!! (Sucks to pay dear for growth). Payroll up. Operating margin down.\u00a0\n* 2019 -2020. Revenue grows at 9.9% company changes dividend policy to a more conservative policy (30-50% IFRS profit - see image attached).\u00a0\n* 2021-2022 Revenue growth stabilizes at 4.4%. Payroll is still high (probably the biggest risk).\n\n30% dividend on 1.25EUR EPS (2021) is 6.5%. This is in the lower range.  \nI would still like to dig through every filing to get a better feel for it, but I have a good feeling from this brief overview.\n\n  \nRisks: 1) Their parcel business is big. What happens when consumers feel the pinch and stop spending? (My risk for everything at the moment). 2) Payroll costs? Can they keep up with Belgium\u2019s payroll increases? I remember we spoke about the need to raise prices every so-and-so year\u2026 3) What is the consensus from the consumer on the ground in Belgium regarding Bpost\u2019s service? Is there a better competitor?\n\nStill, the stock has been de-risked. The \"growth investors\" have given up, leaving this for dead. Leaving me to pick it up at bargain prices.\n\nFor those degens on here, I plead. stop throwing your money down the drain. Bet on surer things. If you want to REALLY BET. Then just option up and go big. But this is not advice.\n\nFor my [onlyfans](https://purplefloyd.substack.com/)",

Is the worst over? \n\nHere are a few indications that key stocks may be turning around:\n\n* Tesla's stock which is down 31% for the year, crossed into \"Death Cross\" territory on 5/26/22 where it still lingers. But today, UBS upgraded Tesla to a \"BUY\" and giving **$TSLA** a price target of $1100.\n* Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, recently purchased an estimated $2.1 million worth of Apple and Microsoft options. Both of these stocks crossed into the \"Death Cross\" - **$MSFT** on 3/15/22, and **$AAPL** on 6/3/22.\n\nNeedless to say, where goes $AAPL; $MSFT; and $TSLA, goes the broader markets.\n\nIn this mix let's add AT&amp;T (**$T**) which entered the \"Death Cross\" way back on 7/21/21 and recently emerged victorious rising into the \"Golden Cross\" on 5/26/22.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fdoeomedzk491.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d63b913a4d9dba649a44cff54f9baf4b4d447cf4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pclco8ftxk491.png?width=1443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54eaedc5c1c3762926d11230161c0f49cb4080e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhl0lpy1zk491.png?width=1439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a310c80e699d2ef02d227916db58e02e08790620\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nxcxsxaqyk491.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51730dc07766a27bdd398c4a166b538ea422ad5e",

The three major indexes continued to fall, with the Nasdaq down more than 3% and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 down about 2.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the first break below support since the rally began on May 25, and a new low in nearly two weeks. The stock market has fluctuated up and down for two weeks in a row, neither rising nor falling. But starting at 1:00 p.m. on June 9, it turned around and kept falling, with no turning back at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCPI rose again. It shows that the Fed raising interest rates may not have obvious effect. So does it mean that the Fed will adopt a more favorable tightening policy in the future? I guess the answer is yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I have been worried about the market falling, so I have been adopting a hedging strategy on googl and tsla. The so-called hedging is to set short and long positions at the same time, and then set a stop loss, but not set a profit.\n\nFor example, before the close on the afternoon of June 9, I set up a googl hedge order at 2322. The stock market opened this morning and googl fell over $40, making me 9K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow to avoid the risk of market decline?\n\nDoes anyone have a better suggestion?\n\nHope for a better answer, thanks.",

    "title": "In the long term we are all dead, In the short and intermediate term, we are all SCREWED!",
    "selftext": "The CPI sure hit it out of the park today, exceeding every expectation and destroying the notion that inflation has peaked already. Shortly afterwards, the consumer sentiment number came in at a record low of 50.2, down 14% from May. The FED meets next week and apparently 75 basis points may be on the table (it should). Oh, and the first big chunk of assets from the FED's balance sheet is going to roll off on the 15th, resulting in god-knows-what reaction in the bond markets?\n\nThe economic turmoil is just getting started and there doesn't appear to be any signs of things changing. Looking over the CPI report, the numbers are way worse than even the headline number suggests. May came in at 1% m/o/m, signaling that double digit inflation may be in our future. The food category was up 1.2% for the month and many segments are showing mid teens increases y/o/y. A third of the overall weighting of the CPI is shelter, which is ridiculously underreported at 5.5%. Average rents have gone up 15% and home prices 20% in the last year. What would this number look like if properly calculated???\n\nConsumer sentiment has always been more of a \"soft\" economic number, given that it is based on feel rather than hard numbers. But a decline that puts the figure below both 2008 and 1999 is nevertheless  startling. When you add anecdotal evidence to the equation it becomes even more real. Layoffs, hiring freezes and recinided jobs offers are just a portion. People are pessimistic about housing purchases, gas prices and energy costs, to name a few. The thing about sentiment is that it can become powerful enough to actually change the more hardened economic numbers. If people feel that everything is more expensive, they may feel poorer and spend less as a result, even if their budgetary reality is not as bad as it seems. It can become a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nAnd then there are the financial markets. Despite the recent beatings that most financial instruments have taken since the end of last year, QQQ and SPY are still about 20% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind that we are currently in a highly inflationary period at the start of a rate hike cycle, with the FED beginning to unwind its massive balance sheet, unlike pre-pandemic. There still appears to be a lot farther that asset prices can fall.\n\nThe reason that these issues aren't going to go away anytime soon is due to (my new favorite term) \"excessive savings.\" This term has popped up quite a bit recently and refers to the amount of savings that households have compared to the pre stimulus days. Most projections put this number in the $2 trillion range. It's funny that higher savings rates are now viewed as an economic problem. On the one hand, it is this cash that has helped spur the inflation that is currently devouring purchasing power. On the other hand, this \"excess\" cash is going to keep inflation higher for longer as people spend down their savings until they reach a level of discomfort that causes them to pull back.  That may take awhile. \n\nTo add one more ingredient to the shit sandwich that we are staring down, how much leverage is there actually being employed in our financial markets? We all got a deserved laugh at Bill Hwang blowing up billions using ridiculous leverage in his opaque family office dealings.  His mentors at Tiger Global Management are down 50%, making one wonder what type of risk they have on their books. Elon leveraged his TSLA shares to buy Twitter. Michael Saylor from MSTR leveraged a balance sheet full of fake internet money to get loans to buy more fake internet money. The big guys are doing these types of things, but what about the small fish?\n\nThere was a hilarious post the other night about someone who sold their house and instead of paying cash for the next property, they put a big chunk in stocks and took a margin loan against their portfolio to pay for the place. After 5 weeks of declines, they were facing a $250k margin call that they couldn't meet.  Who knows if this is even true, but we see actual examples of this stuff in the daily financial news pretty frequently with the big fish. How many little fish are leveraged to the hilt?\n\nLong story short, we are facing historically high inflation, rising interest rates, quantitative tightening, plummeting consumer sentiment, falling markets and potential issues that haven't even come to light yet. What could go wrong???\n\nPositions: Cash gang waiting for a decent entry (QQQ 250, SPY 350 at a minimum)\n\nTLDR: The economy is screwed....",

    "title": "$TSLA Guide to Playing the TSLA Stock Split",
    "selftext": "As all of you who have long traded TSLA know, TSLA stock price follows laws of numerology. In particular, it has strong affinity for price points like \"$69\", \"$1337\", \"$420\" and let us not forget, \"$420.69\", which is the most powerful of these.\n\nBecause the board is going to do a 3:1 split, and because we know the shareholders will almost certainly support it, we can trade options in anticipation.\n\nQuite simply, a future share at $420.69 is thus $1262.07 in current value (since $420.69 = $1262.07. Or, you can add $420.69 three times if you can't do multiplication). \n\nThe split sounds like it should be done by fall. So, the play is therefore to simply buy up November or October calls at $1262, or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it's ITM, call it $1200. These calls in turn split into basically $420c (or $400c). \n\nI made jokes about this last time, and everyone thought I was being a moron, but had I actually done the trade I would've made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously LAST time this happened, and crossed 420. Because past results are often a prediction of future performance\\*, we can expect TSLA stock to end up north of $420.69, since that is the nature of things.\n\nGood luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning. Remember: Tesla\u2019s biggest product is not the model 3, but rather, its stock, and they\u2019ll have three times as much of it. BULLISH\n\n\\*many exceptions always apply",

I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7",

With a loss of 25%, this portfolio is doing just slightly worse than market indexes for 2022. \ud83d\udcb8 \ud83d\udcb8 \ud83d\udcb8\n\nRemoving outliers (TSLA), we're down 83% to $187.85. As Warren Buffet says, some stocks can keep your whole portfolio afloat and thankfully TSLA is that stock and Elon is the levelheaded leader we need to go to the moon! \ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't buy any shares in any companies and what I bought expired worthless (gourds). *Don't worry apes,* I DRS'd my GME shares in April, but unfortunately I lost the paper certificates on Christmas \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udfff when my car got broken into by coyotes \ud83d\udc3a.

And now, I'm sharing these nuggets with you for free, because you can't put a price on something priceless or a worth on something worthless. \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\n\n**1. Do insider trading \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f-** Insider trading is when you trade inside like at your house or office. It's much more profitable and comfortable than outsider trading, which is when you trade living outside in a tent or your car. Right now I\u2019m in a Hyundai Santa Fe outside of Santa Fe, CA, by the I-5 exit next to Wendy\u2019s. No, I'm not sucking off outside of Wendy's! I tried that, and they called the police. \ud83c\udfda\ufe0f\n\n**2. Watch futures \ud83d\udd2e** - After markets close, traders monitor futures markets, or \"Futes,\" to see how the market will perform the next day. After market close, I monitor Monster, Craigslist and Indeed because I'm been concerned about my future since my employer fired me for gambling all day. \ud83d\udd2e\n\n**3.0 Don't under estimate the earth-shattering potential of Web 3.0 \ud83c\udf10-** I paid six figures of for coins, tokens and monkey pictures. These digital assets were worth thousands of dollars and now they're worth dozens of dollars. This is highly disruptive technology. \ud83c\udf3d has taken me to a totally new paradigm of personal finance: chapter 11 bankruptcy. \ud83c\udf10\n\n**4. No Regulation! \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f** Everyone alive should trade stocks, even babies! \ud83d\udc76 I'll go January 6th if the SEC tries to regulate this! I am personally emailing Hunter Biden a flacid dick pic every day and I encourage you to join me. Tell the government: TURN THE PRINTER BACK ON! I'M FUCKING DYING! \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\n\n**5. Play dead \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f-** The only way to win in a bear market is to curl up and play dead.

    "title": "Useless TSLA and BA technical analysis for the long weekend",
    "selftext": "TLDR: We rally next week.  TSLA to mid 700's and BA to 170s.  \n\nAfter all the doom and gloom the past few weeks, bulls are looking for anything to give them hope.  Well, I may have some. I rode TSLA puts down on Thursday and hit a 5 bagger, now I've put those gains into TSLA and BA calls.  Here's why.  First off, TSLA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlzo431lga691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c3ca14fdcf0de62dfd8d83e4bf41b876f8d0cb5\n\nThe weekly chart shows a couple things.  First off, the MACD is turning bullish. Second, you can see that we're at an important level of historical support.  The 625 level served as support February 23, March 9 July 8, July 19, and July 27 back in 2001, and May 24/25 of this year.  We bounced off that number hard on Thursday and steadily climbed back to 650. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37kb9mndia691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44a50491883a4e98ef2aa72cb73f75a7cb2bcac6\n\nOn the daily chart, you can see a very clear double bottom that may be forming.  One thing to note is the rising RSI as the 625 low is being retested.  On 5/25, the RSI hit 30 as TSLA bounced off the 625 support level.  As we hit the same level yesterday, the RSI held around 40.  This RSI divergence is generally seen as a bullish indicator that more buyers are stepping in at this level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, BA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17h3czk7ja691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4568956497d14a66e709ab7558dfa8e987220bdf\n\nThe weekly chart shows that BA bounced of a significant historical support from the Covid era.  After hitting the low of 90 in March 2020, BA bounced to 186, and subsequently dropped to 115 a few weeks later, finding strong support there.  Over 2 years later, the stock found support at the exact same price, and recovering to a high 138 today. One thing to note is the volume. Almost 100 million shares were traded this week, more than the double the past couple weeks.  After the Covid crash, you can see that every time there was a significant increase in volume, Boeing ran. And when Boeing runs, it runs hard.  Additionally, you can see the MACD turning bullish.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ypnfh5snka691.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89b85ae6d82e64bbb4e1194365f7e9beec4b8c65\n\nOn the daily, you can see a double bottom forming, similar to TSLA.  The RSI is trending upward, and there is a gap between 162-167 that will be filled eventually, and I think that'll be soon.  Volume is consistently rising as well.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I think that BA is a fairly easy stock to manipulate.  If you look at the daily chart going back to March 2020, some of the swings are absolutely insane.  Smart money has loaded up on calls, as you can see below.  The next 2 weeks have a very bullish option chain setup.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d67qvh72ma691.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaf5b83ea1554bb2f359852b1f9e1135543f500b\n\nThere was some significant call buying today at the 140 and 150 strikes for next Friday as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2pei1o4ma691.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b5df0089b9ba9342e2f6370b1b82b4d81dcd7c\n\nMaybe the market will continue to crash next week and we'll see more doom and gloom, but there has to be a decent snap back rally at some point where buyers step in, and I think these levels are where that will happen.  I don't think this is THE bottom, but it could possible be A bottom in the short term.\n\nPositons:\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o6a1ff43na691.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba211763079150641d8e1ee260d46f8f7fb0a6ad\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4lqkhvg5na691.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109292ce3f4b6f5d245fba3c98653cfe6758631e",

Even \u201csafe haven\u201d sectors like energy are being hit hard at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vcgp8nawuu691.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46edc4c3ff45bff8e8dc6c3632a9009b886fb6d3\n\nAt the end of the week SPY broke through a several months old support trendline with fairly decent volume increases. From a technical point this is not a money making setup. No chart book has this pattern as a high probability of success trade. Ideally SPY would base for the next week and then try to stage a recovery. We will have to see how this acts with the Fed Chair speaking later on this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gj2kyluxuu691.png?width=2275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60dc946a684995dc47a8f2b2c5560ed7cd4d01c6\n\nQQQ is looking slightly better than SPY. QQQ could be beginning to base as the lows of Thursday and Friday are still intact. However the overall trend is still negative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/32vodjsyuu691.png?width=2276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dd9d1247c1c3b434429a8f84fdd395fd3b76c08\n\nHowever, although the indices are looking rough there are still some stocks potentially setting up. TSLA has a higher low setup that could trigger if it takes out Wednesdays high with volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36m9lvzzuu691.png?width=2269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5e6f0d8bfff0a56202ffecbe886bafeb86aa36a\n\nSimilarly, GOOGL also has a higher low setup that would trigger if Wednesdays highs were taken out with volume.\n\nOverall it would be very constructive for the markets if this week was quiet and allowed stocks to find a base. There are only a few individual stocks setting up for high probability trades. IF they trigger positions should be stepped into lightly by staggering your buys. For example, if TSLA triggers only buy 20% of your final position size. This will limit losses if the market reverses. Please take caution this week and do not over exposure yourself to this choppy market environment.",

    "selftext": "Recap on yesterdays market action:\n\n* SPY closed up 2.52%\n* QQQ closed up 2.33%\n* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 2.15%\n\nToday was a good start to the market rally and recovery but we still have a lot of ground to cover before the bear market is truly shook. As for market news we still have the Fed Chair speaking Wednesday and Thursday and this may have an impact on the markets.\n\n[SPY Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/ul8yoezfg2791.png?width=2269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6940c065d35f8b39297d142795ae560fc1c91d62)\n\nSPY broke back above the resistance trendline (support lines become resistance once they have been broken). Even though SPY broke above the line it did so on below average volume and started to fade into the close. If SPY can base above the trendline for a few days and then stage a rally that would be very productive.\n\n[QQQ Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/unhfet2hg2791.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1b2610e183a74b376d134681eb20b23ddb247d2)\n\nQQQ never broke below its support trendline, however this does not mean that it is performing stronger than SPY. Today it was up on below average volume and also faded into the close, closing about halfway through the daily range. Similarly to SPY, if QQQ could base for a few days and then advance on volume that would start to signal a rally.\n\n[GOOGL Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/1ka1aufjg2791.png?width=2269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b905f384c8e6ad4ed1ec74da704129619949970f)\n\nGOOGL triggered a buy today when it took out Wednesdays high with volume. I considered opening a small position but missed the alert and by the time I saw it GOOGL had advanced approximately 1% past the buy point. Even if I had opened a position I likely would have sold partial shares (20% of position) near the high and more shares (50% of remaining position) when GOOGL came back to my buy point. This market is very choppy and thus makes take partial profits quickly essential. As of now GOOGL needs to take out the June 10th high with volume to be considered a buy.\n\n[TSLA Daily Timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/n78zwjokg2791.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19b72aecdad15761cc11314360adf1424ce01e3)\n\nTSLA is acting slightly stronger that GOOGL at the moment. Also advancing past Wednesdays high with volume although we did see a fade into the close. Similarly to GOOGL I had planned to buy taking out the highs but missed the alerts (I was occupied with a meeting). TSLA did form a downward sloping trendline that may provide an entry if it is taken out with volume and a good market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, todays price action was constructive but no enough to become extremely bullish. This is simply one step on the long road to a health market. The indices may setup up for an entry but profits need to be taken quick and losses even quicker. As for individual stocks that show high probability setups they are few and far in between. My true favorites are currently only GOOGL and TSLA, more may soon be added to this list. Stay focused and watch your stocks because the market has the ability to turn quickly.",

    "selftext": "Ford\u2019s MachE \u2013 a examination of Tesla\u2019s competition, with $TSLA implications\n\nTL/DR upfront:\n\nUpcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up \u00e0 market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford\u2019s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition\u2014for several years (until \\~ 2026-2028). \n\n\\---- \n\nArgument:\n\n**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto\u2019s outlook writ large.** \n\nFord\u2019s \u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. \n\n* The \u2018Standard Range\u2019 RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees\n* The \u2018Extended Range\u2019 (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery\n\nFords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:\n\n* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. \n* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor \n* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality\n* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. \n\nIf Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,\n\n* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices \n* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)\n* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). \n   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines\u2026the trucks 230 mile range\u2019s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. \n* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) \n\nIt is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. \n\nAdditionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:\n\n* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups\n* A need to develop a \u2018supercharging\u2019 network. \n   * Look more deeply into their published numbers\u2014if you nix Tesla\u2019s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla\u2019s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. \n* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries\n   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production \n\n**SO WHAT?**\n\n1.  Ford has to raise prices\u2014they have no other choice. \n   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  \n2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers \n3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can\u2019t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.\n4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices\n5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. \n\nAdd to this several Tesla-phenomena \n\n1. Tesla\u2019s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand \n   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries \n   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn\u2019t for Tesla\u2019s record setting CAGR\u2014which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. \n2. Therefore, because Tesla has more \u2018buffer\u2019 to decrease prices\u2014in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future \n\nConclusion\n\nTesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. \n\nWould **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.",

    "selftext": "ARK thinks $TSLA is going to be a $3,000 stock in 2026. They've used Monte Carlo as one method to help them determine that price.   \n\n\n# Why that is stupid: \n\n This unconventional mathematical method is extremely powerful in the study of stochastic process. Here comes the argument on Linkedin. \"Stock price can be seemed as a [Wiener Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process). Hence, we can use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price.\" said a data science blog. Well, in order to be a Wiener Process, we have to assume the stock price is continuous in time. In reality, the market closes. The overnight volatility exists. But that is not the biggest issue here. The biggest issue is, can we really use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price, even a range or its direction?\n\nThe author offered a quite interesting idea. As he suggested, the first step was to run as many simulations as possible on [stochastic differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation#Use_in_probability_and_mathematical_finance) to predict stock price. The goal of simulations was to pick a best fitted curve (in translation, the smallest standard deviation) compared to the historical data. There might exist a hidden pattern in the historical log return. The best fitted curve had the potential to replicate the hidden pattern and reflect it in the future forecast. The idea sounds neat, doesn't it?   \n\n\nInspired by his idea, we can build up the simulation accordingly. To fully unlock the potential of Monte Carlo simulation, the ticker we pick is $GME (Gamestop), one of the best performing stocks.  \n\n\nIf we used Monte Carlo on $GME (From January 2019, to May 2022) we would think the stock price would be roughly what it was in the beginning of 2019.....Whereas in actuality the black line shows what the stock did.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monte Carlo on $GME](https://preview.redd.it/l9chc3tfek891.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494e12bdbbada29f1aac45a18244978dbbae9796)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's look at $TSLA. If we are to use Monte Carlo on $TSLA we would think the stock price is just shy of $1500 today...when in reality it's $676.59 at the time of this writing...it's more than 50% off.   \n\n\nCathy is most likley going to have a PT that is well over 2x what $TSLA will actually be in 2026 using stupid stuff like this, potentially 3x too high.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Monte Carlo on $TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/0aou7drvek891.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da91080070d8a82cbd7e27ed93efe1a0ad3107c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nUsing Monte Carlo in stonks is stupid.",

    "selftext": "Tesla is expected to announce quarterly production and delivery figures this weekend and it's expected to break its multi-quarter streak of record-setting results.   \n\n\nLet's look at recent events: \n\n\\- An extended shutdown of its factory in Shanghai.  \n\\- Elon's been unusually quiet, but has been warning of a recession for weeks now...  \n\\- Layoffs of 200 of the total 350 staff working on automated driving.   \n\\- IMO -- the proposed stock split is an attempt to keep the hype alive, and make it easier for retail to pile into the stock keeping the price inflated  \n\n\nIn 1Q22 Tesla delivered 310,000 vehicles. This is more than ANY previous quarter. \n\nAnalyst are suggesting this quarter will see 281,700.\n\nWhen I saw this graphic from Bloomberg, it reminded me of something that happened not too long ago. Netflix (chart below). I saw a post recently on WSB that was super long, and the OP was bearish on Tesla. I think OP made a few valid points, while Tesla has seen a bit of a hit -- it's still trading at quite the multiple.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Expected 2Q22 Delivery](https://preview.redd.it/e6c20cp9m0991.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6ac481eafb00c2c8504d25772379e4c1e16bf1b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Netflix first subscriber loss 1Q22](https://preview.redd.it/75jpigygm0991.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ccb1defeb45c65899860c048600d94beeb3e108)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$TSLA stock price today](https://preview.redd.it/y4x0nh0um0991.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30fff4ad0a91b0f35d20667220b4d524e4e94583)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX stock price today](https://preview.redd.it/4prep1kvm0991.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=900d546a0f1c617a52dc72b95a9171986c193bf7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile it would be really stupid to say...Netflix was \\~$700 and then went below $200 $TSLA will do the same! I do think this could be something that causes $TSLA to take a hit, and a big hit. While it's fair to say analyst have provided info, and investors should be expecting a lower number of deliveries, and it's priced in.... I'm not so sure.   \n\n\nLooking at the chart below of a more recent PA on $TSLA, we can see it's \"bottomed out\" in the low $600 range, bounced, and almost retested but hit a higher low. I don't particularly think that a low delivery number alone sends Tesla under $600, but I do think when they report earnings, if there is anything that is not absolutely perfection on their part, it will send this thing under $600... and then, after all the fan boys who held / bought in at $1200 freak out, send it down into the $400s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$TSLA PA](https://preview.redd.it/4zvvjr24n0991.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e7f6479b0a6b9e96b410c341056c028071bd2a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy final big gripe is that I recently discovered that the once beloved Cathie Wood has published some of the models that are used by $ARK on Github. Now I'm sure they use several things, but one thing they used was a Monte Carlo model on Tesla that gave them a $3,0000 PT by the end of 2026. I wrote a separate post about why this is absolutely absurd. But the reason I bring this up is it seems like there are still people with unrealistic expectations here, and it has not fully set in yet that the price is way too high for current environment, I think it has a real chance to fall hard...and fast.",

With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: **Make some fucking money.**\n\nBefore I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: **this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.**\n\nSo get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let\u2019s go.\n\n# Part 1: The lore of the electric K\u00e4fer\n\nSpool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the \u201c(not so) secret master plan\u201d of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot **harder and more complex than initially thought**. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c\n\nYou know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to \u201cfuck off\u201d more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We\u2018ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting\n\n&gt;\u201cHumans are underrated\u201d.\n\n**Heartwarming**.\n\nMind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.\n\nTesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5\n\nWhen things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, **this bombshell hit the wire:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b\n\n**If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.**\n\nOur good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3\n\nThe deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.\n\n# Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts\n\nWe have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, **we are now going to war.**\n\nAs you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful \u201cluxury\u201d car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. **They combine everything MBA\u2019s are afraid of.**\n\n* Insanely capital intensive\n* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)\n* Humongous unionized workforce\n* Stiff competition\n* Razor thin margins\n* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)\n* Supply chains longer than the river Nile\n\nYou get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.\n\n**No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.**\n\nAs you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.\n\nFamously, Railroads are really \u201cTransportation\u201d companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.\n\n**That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don\u2019t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA\u2019s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP.**\n\nWhat comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who **loves** this kind of business?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nddze2sfyx891.png?width=1451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec09835151e77b3dd587617e7ba39c76a8fecdaf\n\nDamn right. **Warren Buffet.** The beloved godfather of predictable cash flows. So why don\u2019t we take these attractive business models\n\n[Are you getting it?](https://preview.redd.it/67vg4z62bx891.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4cff05cd6cb87bf04a503781935fba4b2323df5)\n\nAnd cosplay as the messiah of capitalism.

Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don\u2019t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.\n\n**Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aba28abe9b87c212b0db605dfef3cd33258caa7b\n\nAdd a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that.

After a short rally into February, **a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down**. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of Normandy, **this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.**\n\nEvery person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime.

Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.\n\n**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.\n\n**So how do we fix the valuation?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3\n\nAfter we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  **Hype, momentum and FOMO.** Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?\n\n**You bet!** Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. **Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.**\n\nThis market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a **baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae58e006a733b8ec9aab967aae15a42d50c74c50\n\n**Everyone, EVERYONE** was buying calls, **WSB** was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.\n\nEven **Softbank** bought calls.

The short the short shorts short\n\nI am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.\n\n**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: \u201cNever short Tesla\u201d, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.**\n\nAs you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.\n\n**And as we have learned, the market really can\u2019t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.**\n\nFor reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.\n\n[Lets look at the growth rate again. ](https://preview.redd.it/ltesnjnjsx891.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f49f1ebb746f2cd305807ce55821c15d9fc4a5f)\n\nI am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla's remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.\n\nSo, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.\n\n**This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.**\n\nThey know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc399243c95a7f9cb32988a2b27aa2c37c6e8bb\n\n**Let\u2019s try to read a bit into the recent clues.**\n\n1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are \u201cGiant Money Money furnaces\u201d we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.\n2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.\n3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.\n4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.\n5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.\n6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.\n7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.\n8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.\n9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let\u2019s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.\n10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.\n11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A \u2153 stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?\n12. The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can't get out anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?**\n\n* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow\n* Earnings are next month\n* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.\n* Market is closed on Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I am in. How are we playing this?**\n\nIf you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, **you buy puts.** Depending on your personal risk tolerance **300 strike puts with 1 month DTE** look about right.

    "title": "AMC first impressions",
    "selftext": "Hello WSB,\n\nFor the last week, I've spent some time on $GME and $AMC. I have some first impressions, which I thought I'd share. I should point out that my views are limited by the amount of time I've spent on the companies, which is about 15 hours for AMC and 5 hours for GME. I generally recommend at least 100, and more preferably, 500 hours of research on a stock before initiating a position.\n\nThe TLDR is that both stocks are approximately fairly valued. Most stocks (90% IMO) are fairly valued by the market. The market is quite efficient. If you find yourself unearthing great opportunities every time you look at a stock, you're doing it wrong. Very cheap (or very expensive) stocks only appear rarely, and those opportunities don't last long. In hindsight, it is easy to say \"well TSLA was really undervalued for a while.\" Sure. But the risk-adjusted investment thesis wasn't obvious at that time.\n\nTo me, AMC is funny because neither the bulls, nor the bears are exactly right. The bears are missing the obvious: this was a fairly profitable company with an actually decent business model that will return to its former self. Sure, the financials right now are really ugly, but they have weathered the worst of it and have been able to refinance their very expensive paper. With the \"apes\" in town, AMC should have literally no problem accessing cheaper money. So the stock isn't going to 2: sorry, shorts. I will be sharing models &amp; notes at some point soon.\n\nThe bulls also have it wrong, though. The value of the company is limited by the somewhat small and competitive space of box office. US Box office is only so big and AMC's share can only be so big before our favorite useless US government agency squawks about monopoly. So admission revenue can only ever really be 3-4B. Admissions margins aren't that bad, nor is the food &amp; beverage that comes with. The base business is fairly easy to value, and as I mentioned, near-sighted bears forget this simple fact. $800m in EBITDA in 2018 is fairly juicy if we can return to that. I think we will. But, Aron does not strike me as an incredible CEO who can transform or extend the business. The Hycroft deal, in my eyes, is embarrassing and will not result in value creation. The other expansion plans are more reasonable but still risky. If you think Aron can pull off multiple expansions into adjacencies flawlessly, you will be rewarded. If you model a normal probability of success &amp; risk in those efforts, you get fair value. There is no free lunch here.\n\nThe other thing that bears miss is short sellers are not some value creation tool. While some short-term hijinks may very well exist, they do not really impact price. Why not? Price discovery includes long sellers, which dwarf short sellers. Put the bullshit of \"synthetic shares\" and other non-existent creations out of your mind. Is this a stock you want to buy because you are getting it for less than the price a normal buyer (say Warren Buffet, KKR, etc.) would pay for company in an auction? That's all that matters. To me, the answer to this question, is that if an auction to buy AMC were held today, buyers would pay the approximate market price.\n\nRough price target: $11 based on 7% discount rate as revenues return to 5B, growing to \\~$7B towards the end of the decade. I'm assuming the company returns to prior peak EBITDA. It's possible there is slight upside to this and I will provide updates soon, but I don't see $20 or anything as even possible unless Aron pulls off several tricky execution milestones.\n\nThis is Shkreli. You already.",

Tesla will report lower earnings, in line with what everyone thinks. The stock will then rally.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause everyone knows the numbers are going to be lower. They had issues with both the German and Chinese factories, and there are supply chain problems. This means that even if the numbers come in low, as long as they're not cataclysmically low, the stock will moon. Why? Because it's not as low as expected.\n\nMy predictions: one, the numbers are not as bad as expected and the stock moons. Two, the numbers are really bad and the stock goes into the 500s. Who cares? Then you can buy it at $500 and enjoy seeing it go back over $1000 when they get China and Germany back up.\n\nYou guys are insane for getting against Tesla.",

After hours and hours of research, I was able to deduce that Elon is trying to tell us something about this event as he has done in the past.\n\nAccording to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/), Elon is currently the wealthiest person in the world and had 7 children prior to having sex with his employee and bringing twins into this world.  A man of his stature would not be doing such thing unless it was to tell the TSLA shareholders and call option holders that he is pumping his employee because TSLA will be pumping as well.\n\nPlease keep in mind this is also the man who allegedly had a threesome with Amber Heard and Cara Cara Delevingne and he also grew back his hair ([source](https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/56c6b63713cf45f263a7e506e16f304f/resize/1320/f/jpg/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2022/05/20/16530053242623.jpg)).\n\nAnd for full transparency reasons, I do have positions in TSLA.

Mr. Musk requested information on how many Twitter accounts are bots, and Twitter has provided Mr. Musk access to its \u201cfirehose,\u201d or stream of tweets. It has continued to share additional information with him.\n\nOn Thursday, The Washington Post reported that the deal was in jeopardy, and that Mr. Musk\u2019s team was \u201cexpected to take potentially drastic action.\u201d The article\u2019s claims, which could not be confirmed by the DealBook newsletter, took Twitter and its advisers by surprise, because they did not consider the deal to be in any further peril than at any other point in recent months.\n\nMr. Musk did not respond to a request for a comment. Twitter reiterated that it intended \u201cto close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms.\u201d\n\nThere are many \u201cdrastic\u201d actions Mr. Musk could take, but as it pertains to the deal, there are two clear possibilities: He could deliver a letter to Twitter saying he is terminating the deal, and he could sue Twitter. Those two actions would most likely, but not necessarily, happen simultaneously.\n\nThere are no clear grounds for Mr. Musk to try to break the deal, because Twitter has publicly disclosed that roughly 5 percent of its users are bots since it went public. But he may try to claim that this disclosure is intentionally misleading, a very high bar to meet legally.\n\nThere are many \u201cdrastic\u201d actions Mr. Musk could take, but as it pertains to the deal, there are two clear possibilities: He could deliver a letter to Twitter saying he is terminating the deal, and he could sue Twitter.

But he may try to claim that this disclosure is intentionally misleading, a very high bar to meet legally.\n\nThe stakes are high. The most valuable part of Twitter right now is its acquisition agreement with Mr. Musk. Its shares are down about 24 percent since April, and trade well below the price agreed with Mr. Musk. Twitter\u2019s stock fell 4 percent in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nTwitter is seeing pressure on its advertising business, has frozen hiring and is laying off some staff members. To accept less than the price it originally negotiated with Mr. Musk could expose Twitter to shareholder lawsuits. So while litigation could be costly, losing the deal may be even worse.\n\nSource: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/musk-twitter-deal.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/musk-twitter-deal.html)\n\n**Elon Musk's Twitter takeover journey continues, but this time, the setting might be in court.

    "title": "Elon Musk backing out of the Twitter deal was a high IQ play to prevent shareholder panic when pulling billions out of Tesla stock.",
    "selftext": "Imagine you\u2019re selling a used car - when someone asks you \u201cwhy are you selling this used car\u201d you say \u201cwell I think this is the most it will be worth as the used car market is inflated so I want to pull cash out before it goes down\u201d.\n\nWhy should they purchase it? Especially when a crowd of worshipers (the potential buyers), hang on your every word and you\u2019ve just told them it\u2019s overvalued.\n\nWhat if each and every one of these buyers decides \u201cyou know what, this guy is clever and fuck paying more than it\u2019s worth, especially if I can wait and pay it\u2019s true value in a few months time after the bubble bursts\u201d. Suddenly demand dries up and the whole supply curve shifts, making used cars worth less. (Panic Selling WHO??)\n\nInstead of saying **why** you can just lie and say \u201cwell I like this other used car, so I thought I\u2019d sell this one so I could buy another\u201d suddenly there is no blind panic, because you just want to buy another car, right?\n\n/s\n\nUpon sale of your used car you pull out on purchasing the other used car. Leaving you happy with cash in the bank and the used car buyer none the wiser. \n\nNow read this again, **instead of used cars at the peak of a second hand car bubble, it\u2019s Tesla stock at the peak of the stock market bubble**.\n\nWe peaked in January, right? So if you take a good long look.. when did good ol\u2019 Elon start selling shares? \n\nIf I recall Nov, Dec 2021 and April 2022.. that\u2019s pretty close to the market peak, or am I just retarded? \n\nI\u2019m impartial to Elon. I know some of you guys give him the sucky sucky, some of you give him the \u201cV\u201d\u2019s, but personally IDFC for your opinion, who asked?\n\nBut I do think it made sense for him to back out of the deal. He would have basically had an excuse both legally and from a PR perspective to dump a chunk of Tesla shares at the peak without causing wise spread panic and tanking teslas share price long term which would not be in his best interest. (He still holds what? $100b in Tesla stonks?) \n\nI think this was a smart move on his part. Twitter are just a ripe lamb for the slaughter especially with an obvious bot problem. Why even pretend you can deliver on something that is an obvious Achilles heel. \n\nFair game and GG to the IQ icon that is Elon Muskrat.\n\nI hope for the sake of my buddies that TSLA holds out longer term.",

    "selftext": "\nWe've all read about the curses on sports teams when their owners do evil &amp; bad things. There is the curse of Billy the Goat [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat) that kept the Cubs from winning the world series for a 70+ years. Babe Ruth's [Curse of Bambino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino) kept the RedSox from winning the championship for 80+ years. And now we have the Curse of GME Stonk - If you bet against GME during the meme stock phase, you got trouble. Here is rundown of what has happened to the key players so far:\n-- Gabe Plotkin, Melvin Capital. He shutdown the fund after suffering $billions in losses. He is looking for a job rn. Dude also has a stake in the Charlotte Hornets. Enough said.\n-- Andrew Left, Citron research. He lost 100% of his GME short position and has since [stopped publishing short reports](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qbfn5tftymfw/Amid-the-GameStop-Frenzy-Andrew-Left-Calls-It-Quits-On-Short-Reports-After-20-Years)\nOh and [his house was raided by the feds earlier this year](https://www.shacknews.com/article/128692/tsla-gme-short-andrew-left-of-citron-research-had-his-computers-seized-by-the-fbi-last-year)\n-- Robinhood - Stock is down 80% and even a FTX Billionaire Bro declined to buy 'em\n-- Vlad Tenev - Net worth down 90% and dude has been investigated by Feds and Congress. \n-- Citadel &amp; Ken Griffin - Last seen digging himself into a [deeper hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uzbkk8/after_robinhood_melvin_capital_now_ken_griffin_jr/)\n\nMeanwhile in memeland: GME stock has stabilized, is doing a stock split and the company is moving aggressively with its growth plans. The lesson - don't bet against GME!\n\nIf you got something to say, say it then.\nYou don't think the curse is real? Well then fuck you too!",

    "selftext": "I know that some of you lost money and are mad at him about it, but Elon using Twitter as a bait to sell TSLA stock does not make any sense for the following reasons:\n\n1. Elon started acquiring Twitter stock, before he  sold large chunk of TSLA shares, which was done for tax purposes according to him.\n\n 2. Elon acquired the largest portion of the capital needed for the acquisition of Twitter by getting loans against his shares and attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like Larry Ellison and the Qatar state investment fund. He did not need to actually sell his shares to raise money.\n\n3. Buying a company like Twitter requires extensive research and the use of a lot of resources (mainly financial). This was probably planned at least a year in advance, so the great oracle Elon probably did not have the chance to perfectly time his TSLA selling to maximise his profits. \n\n4. Do you actually think that a guy who tweeted that the  TSLA share price is too high cares so much about his shareholders opinion, so he will orchestrate a very expensive and time consuming operation that could potentially greatly harm his public and business persona, just so he will have an excuse to sell his TSLA shares? Musk has stated numerous times that the sole purpose for his accumulation of wealth is to secure the funding for the dream of his life, which is making humans interplanetary species. Couldn't he just have said that he is going to sell a small portion of his TSLA holdings for that reason? \n\n5. No, TSLA stock probably would not have crashed even if he did not state any reason for the reduction of his stake in the company. It is not like he sold 50 percent. Also, have you seen how devoted are the teslabros? \n\n6. No, you won't be able to sue Elon, cuz your calls expired worthless. One of the main reasons why founders and investors make their company's public is because financials markets provide them with great liquidity. \n\nI obviously can't say for certain why Elon decided to back out of the deal. My personal opinion is that he probably just changed his mind  in part due to miner setbacks like the number of bots on the site. As we all know , he is not very stable as a person and it is probably not as deep as many people think it is.",

If he can make Tesla more valuable than all the car companies in the world combined, he can surely make Twitter more valuable than other social media companies. Especially FB.

Quick question that I\u2019m guessing will not have a straightforward answer.  \n\nI have treated my brokerage account as my main savings account where I can do small scale trades and grow it a little as a hobby.  \n\nNow I\u2019m moving into a phase where I\u2019m preparing to buy a house in the next 6-9 months.  Most of my money is in tech like TSLA, AMC, AAPL, and a couple others.  They are down pretty dramatically from the time I bought them, but the value of my account would still cover a down payment.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the market being down in a long term play, but like everyone I\u2019m uneasy about the economy and the inflation we\u2019re experiencing.  I\u2019m trying to decide if I should take the losses and get my money into a safer location so that I can buy my house without the risk of losing my down payment to a crash, or if I should leave it in for another few months and see what happens.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "title": "Twitter contends that Musk breached his agreement to buy it by not using \u201creasonable best efforts\u201d to close the deal, and so has no right to bail out.",
    "selftext": "The company contends that Musk breached his agreement to buy it by not using \u201creasonable best efforts\u201d to close the deal, and so has no right to bail out.\n\n\u2018Increasingly outlandish\u2019\n\nTwitter filed a much-anticipated lawsuit yesterday as it looks to force Elon Musk to close his $44 billion acquisition of the company. Twitter argues that it has every right to do so under a specific performance provision in the deal contract.\n\nThe company, with the help of lawyers at Wachtell (which has also worked for Musk), set fire to Musk\u2019s efforts to drop the bid, which it argued were more about the drop in Tesla\u2019s shares and its effect on Musk\u2019s wealth than anything else.\n\n\u201cMusk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,\u201d the company said in the suit, adding: \u201cMusk apparently believes that he \u2014 unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law \u2014 is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.\u201d (Musk has not responded to a request for comment.)\n\nHere is what else Twitter said:\n\nThe company gave Musk everything and more on spam accounts, contrary to Musk\u2019s claims that Twitter stonewalled his efforts to get the information he needed to close the deal. But even then, Twitter claims, Musk\u2019s demands became progressively more irrational.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset, defendants\u2019 information requests were designed to try to tank the deal,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cMusk\u2019s increasingly outlandish requests reflect not a genuine examination of Twitter\u2019s processes but a litigation-driven campaign to try to create a record of noncooperation on Twitter\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nBots do not count as a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d that would justify canceling the deal, despite Musk\u2019s claims that Twitter\u2019s regulatory disclosures, which state that about 5 percent of its accounts are bots, were intentionally misleading. Twitter explicitly said in its regulatory filings that the figures were estimates. And Musk cited fixing the problem of spammers and bots as a primary reason he wanted to buy Twitter, according to the suit.\n\nOn April 9, the day Musk said he wanted to acquire Twitter rather than join its board, he texted Twitter\u2019s chairman, Bret Taylor, to say \u201c\u2018purging fake users\u2019 from the platform had to be done in the context of a private company because he believed it would \u2018make the numbers look terrible,\u2019\u201d the suit reads.\n\nTwitter ran its business in \u201cordinary course,\u201d meaning consistent with how it previously ran things. Breaking an \u201cordinary course\u201d provision has gotten a buyer out of a deal before, notably AB Stable\u2019s acquisition of MAPS Hotels and Resorts during the height of the pandemic. Musk accused Twitter of breaking its ordinary course when it, among other things, slowed hiring and fired two executives without telling him.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-lawsuit.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-lawsuit.html)\n\nTwitter filed a lawsuit yesterday in an effort to pressure Elon Musk to finalize his $44 billion acquisition of the company. TWTR closed +2.38% and TSLA -0.54% yesterday. How do you think the TSLA and TWTR stock prices will react to this lawsuit this week?",

The biggest advocate for TSLA was Cathie Wood, the most reputable Ponzi scheme creator from near history. The company TSLA hired Elon Musk (social media artist) with contracts that promise options if the stock market reaches some sort of price. No one was interested in EVs in that days. (he made a good job with the driving assistant)\n\nThe climate news media exuberance started. The world begins to die in 2060 if nobody does something. If we do not start now, the world will suffer severe, irreversible damage. These sorts of stories get the attention, because they are reasonable to the reader. The real attention happened in times of Corona. At this point the human experienced a \"spiritual relationship\" with the nature because he could not go outside.\n\nThe next part was the historic stimulus that reminded the central bankers of what they actually learned in school and how inflation works. All parts come together as the TSLA makes a profit. The investment world suddenly out of nowhere realized that EVs are the future despite the fact that in the past several companies tried the H2O and EV approaches but in the past, EVs weren't simply the trend. Sadly for them, they followed soon, and some competitors emerged (these are the people that ride the trend, make unlimited money, because of the euphoria, and do not care in the end). New companies with the goal to compete in the EV market. \n\nAll of them and the tech sector took the money like a sponge with the simple story of the future and unlimited prosperity. The politicians and policymakers didn't warn, they loaded up and surfed on the money wave.\n\nThis was probably the last ride on a stimulus-Ponzi-wave in the mid-future. All the companies already made money from issuing new stocks, and all the people that exploited this period already cashed out. The future was sold, and this future is not coming. The real future will be the realization of how the economy really works and what damage it can cause to other people, nations, stability, and freedom.",

Who knows. Could be bearish. I actually don\u2019t even care. \n\n4- contracts super cheap because nobody is buying it. You know what that means right? Bottom is in. \n\n5- wait, cost of revenue is up 300% also? What does that even mean \n\n6- hold on guys. -8% profit margin?  \n\n7- so ok someone please explain to me how revenue can go up 350% but net income down 55%?\n\n8-is money real? \n\n9- ok so I figured it out. Net income was down over 6000% a year ago. Now it\u2019s only down 55%. The net profit margin was -82% and now it\u2019s only -8%. Basically I have no idea how this business is operating or paying employees and sounds like a scam. Which of course means I\u2019m in. \n\n10- I just want to fuck with the algos. TSLA to $2000 EOY. Or $0. Who knows? I\u2019ll be poor either way. Unless it happens to take off on a Friday. 0dte\u2019s are all I can afford anymore.",

Inflation and rates have been rising, putting negative pressure on customer\u2019s willingness to buy vehicles during these uncertain times. \n2. Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter battle could play a factor, and he might end up having to sell more Tesla stock. \n3.

Maintaining that rate would mean Tesla will delivery around 1.4 to 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.\n\n**In a note to clients yesterday, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote that he expects Tesla will maintain its annual delivery target, which he says implies \u201cconsiderable volume ramp in the second half.\"**\n\n**Rosner added Tesla to the firm\u2019s short-term \u201cCatalyst Call Buy List,\u201d advising clients to accumulate shares following Tesla\u2019s pullback this year.

    "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-21/tesla-tsla-executive-under-scrutiny-in-internal-probe\n\nAutomaker to part ways with executive Afshar: people familiar\n\nOmead Afshar, one of Elon Musk\u2019s top lieutenants and the executive running Tesla Inc.\u2019s Texas factory, is under scrutiny in an internal investigation for his role in a plan to purchase hard-to-get construction materials, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nTesla has already fired some employees in relation to the probe, and the electric-vehicle maker plans to part ways with Afshar, likely through a leave of absence initially, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Terms of his exit are still being worked out.\n\nAfshar declined to comment. Tesla and Musk didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe internal investigation, led by Tesla Acting Head of Legal David Searle, started after a purchase order for construction material was identified as suspicious, the people said.\n\nThe order, for a special kind of glass, was flagged to Tesla\u2019s finance and internal audit groups earlier this year, the people said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the glass was for Tesla Chief Executive Officer Musk\u2019s personal use, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nGlobal supply chain disruptions have made the glass difficult to secure, but Tesla\u2019s status as a global manufacturing powerhouse makes it easier for the company to acquire materials in high demand.\n\nAfshar had requested the purchase order be created and told the workers involved it was for a secret project, the people said.\n\nAfshar has continued to work at the Austin, Texas, plant this week, but is likely to take a leave of absence as the investigation continues, the people said.\n\nAs one of Musk\u2019s top executives at Tesla, Afshar has been in charge of overseeing the construction and then production at the plant in Austin, Texas. A member of the office of the CEO since 2017, his most recent job title was listed on his LinkedIn page as a cowboy hat emoji.\n\nInside Tesla, Afshar was seen as Musk\u2019s fixer, dispatched to smooth out kinks in the operation. In a 2019 interview at the University of California at Irvine, his alma mater, Afshar said he\u2019d performed many roles at Tesla over the years.\n\n\u201cI focus on where there\u2019s a problem, so a lot of firefighting. If there\u2019s an issue, that\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually when people see me they\u2019re not always happy, because it means there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAfshar graduated from UC Irvine in 2009 with a degree in biomedical engineering and a season\u2019s experience as a ski instructor at California\u2019s Mammoth Mountain, according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked for more than six years at St. Jude Medical Inc. and its acquirer, Abbott Laboratories, in product engineering and managing roles before joining Tesla, part of a cohort of young, ambitious executives handpicked by Musk to carry out orders.\n\nHe\u2019s been a jack of all trades ever since. In early 2021, as the US was in the beginning stages of a Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Afshar wrote to California\u2019s lead epidemiologist to convey a Tesla board member\u2019s request to assist with distribution of the shot. By this year, Afshar was in Austin, providing tours to potential recruits from the nearby University of Texas. He briefly appeared on stage at Tesla\u2019s Cyber Rodeo event in April, receiving a personal thank-you from Musk himself.",

    "title": "TSLQ and other single stock ETFs",
    "selftext": "So basically you probably knew this but the SEC allowed single stock ETFs like a week ago. TSLQ is one that shorts Tesla and the one I am mostly interested in. \n\nPeople have drastically underrated how much this changes things. Literally everything will be different in my opinion. People were saying this is just options with extra steps and let me explain why I think its not. \n\nFirst of all you can buy options on these for a massive discount. Let me explain:\n\r\nTesla options are very very expensive. \r\nIf we look at a date like 8/19 (the first available options for TSLQ) we can see that the calls and puts are over 50.00 dollars so over 5k to buy them. And some are even more pricey and the further out you go (date wise) the higher cost overall.\r\n\n\nTSLQ as you would guess are way cheaper. A lot of contracts still have yet to be filled (in my experience the lowest i was able to get was 2.00 for a contract that plummeted already) and 2.75 for one of the 0s. \r\n\n\nTo me this will drastically change and will climb closer to the Tesla prices because these are again just a way to buy discounted Tesla options. For example TSLQ shorts Tesla therefore I have purchased puts (my positions are at the bottom) so really I basically bought calls on Tesla. Buying puts on a Tesla bear ETF = buying Tesla calls for much cheaper. \n\n\r\nThe issue is that the trading volume is low which is because it's new in my opinion. Once people start realizing that you can do this and it is accessible in Robinhood I think the will go up to easily a 1:5 TSLQ to Tesla ratio. \r\n\nThat's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not a lot for many of you).\n\n\n\r\n**TLDR:**\r\nBuying puts on TSLQ (Tesla bear ETF) = buying cheap calls on Tesla. \n\nI am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these insanely undervalue things.\r\n\n\n\nMy positions \n\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Fi7Vkn3Uh7P37Ljdfqkx0pu_QrL4BcP/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nWish I had more money I can take this risk with but I hope you all could capitalize on it. (Which also makes me money, obviously)\r\nAnd again I am confident and am fine with taking L if I'm wrong but on the one that I'm down like -190 or whatever that is like 95% of what I put it. Not worried though \r\nExamples of TSLQ options\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-GNqcOEyt6Ou0jPPX8y77tECW7R9qsVM/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nExamples of TSLA\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FwoNobugzGwmciOlYKnoLu508LyMBdN/view?usp=drivesdk\r\n\n**** TLDR ****(but actually at bottom):\r\nSo basically going back to my play I am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these",

Notice how I say \u201cthe stock price is double\u201d not \u201cthe valuation is double\u201d. Then later, I said \u201ctheir valuation is crazy and moronic\u201d not \u201cthe valuation is double\u201d. Learn how to read.\n\nEdit2: yes, the stock price does matter. https://public.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/langm/working_papers/psycho_factors.pdf",

    "selftext": "As some of you may know, Tesla isn\u2019t the only car-maker in the world. You may have even heard of Ford? What about BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Chevrolet, Kia, Cadillac, Hyundai, Lexus, Mazda, Subaru, or Volvo? Come to think of it, I know for a fact some of you out there have heard of Rivian, Nio, and Lucid (you know who you are, I\u2019ve seen your loss porn). Every single one of these car makers (and many, many more) are pressing the \u201cbrrrrrrr\u201d button on electric vehicles. Even the once gas-guzzling, still dick-inflating Hummer is now all electric. Jesus Christ\u2026 If that doesn\u2019t tell you things are changing, then just go ahead and stick those crayons right up your ass and ass-blast away at a dart board to make your next stock picks.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t give a flying fuck which car company wins the EV arms race (and you best believe it\u2019s an arms race: [https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment](https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment) ).

A BATTERY, YOU FUCKSTICK.\n\nWhat do you need to make a battery? Lots of stuff actually\u2026 but primarily? LITHIUM.\n\nFor those of you with less than a 3rd grade reading level, let me paint a picture for you through a few pictures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEV sales are expected to nearly 6X from now to 2030 in just the US alone:\n\n[See how the chart goes up? That means we need more batteries. Just in case, let\u2019s go over this again. What do batteries need? LITHIUM.](https://preview.redd.it/vvteve6mesd91.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf071f095201fe135688d8e86ce64d8995deb561)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s a projection of how much lithium we need to meet the EV demand:\n\n[Notice how this chart also goes up? Almost like it\u2019s related to the first one?](https://preview.redd.it/89nolvxnesd91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1db22399b53255b83322059888c718cff685a7ca)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s how much lithium we\u2019ve been making globally:\n\n[I know this is going to be a lot to take in, but really focus here. The lithium demand chart up above was showing numbers scaled in 1,000\u2019s of metric tons, and this one isn\u2019t. Here\u2019s an easy trick, pretend the numbers on this chart stop after the comma. There you go, you did it!](https://preview.redd.it/ekhh99aresd91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dfb03fa980bc72daf43b7e622eafd9d2f846233)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we\u2019re on the same page, doesn\u2019t it seem like we might have just a little bit of an issue here? I realize you probably dropped that community college economics 101 course mid-term after your dad said he was disappointed in you for puking on his basement carpet again while struggling through your 5th hangover that week\u2026 but even you, you scholar, probably took away one iota of understanding from the first topic of that class: supply and demand.\n\nAlas, just in case you were distracting from texting that Sophomore in your local high-school that you wanted to hook-up with while the professor\u2019s soulless eyes bleakly looked around the nearly empty room, I\u2019ll just go ahead and show you how lithium prices have responded:\n\n[Yeah, line goes brrrrrr. Now it\u2019s hitting home, right? Lithium prices are up 10X since the start of 2021 and 5X since last summer \\(important to note for below\\). Side note: this chart is in CNY \\(Chinese Yuan\\) because China currently dominates the world\u2019s lithium market, but that\u2019s a conversation for another time. Long story short, the world doesn't want China controlling global lithium supplies.](https://preview.redd.it/e41lshctesd91.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7684f6c589979e73e450687deac4d71665a9d50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we've had some pictures for you to look at, hopefully that convinced you to buckle up and choke down that third Adderall pill so you can focus for the next five god-damn minutes and read the rest of this so you can pass out and yarf on your own carpet one day. Take that Dad.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple last important things to note with the charts above.\n\n1.)  Producing more lithium can\u2019t be done with the flip of a switch. Most new facilities take a minimum of 5-7 years to be planned, approved, and start producing. Back in May, some window-licker over at Goldman Sachs wrote that he thinks the lithium market has peaked until 2025 ( [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf) ).\n\nHere\u2019s what just a few others had to say about that report:\n\n\\- [https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/](https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/)\n\n\\- [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)\n\n\\- [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg)\n\n\\- [https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I mean Goldman\u2019s is never wrong, right? They couldn\u2019t possibly be releasing a report like this to sink the lithium market so they can buy more for less, right?? I mean if they thought the lithium market was going to tank for the next few years because of over-supply, they would never BUY MORE Lithium stocks right???\n\nYep, you guessed it. Straight from their most recent 13F-HR filing:\n\n[This is their Q1 filing\u2026 I wonder what their Q2 will have to say when released\u2026](https://preview.redd.it/zwpox5ayesd91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3365cae45ac8e4ac20dab84cf2eb781d80de6c5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, while typically I try not to condone this kind of behavior, I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Window Licker himself to thank him for giving us the buying opportunity of a lifetime on many of these lithium stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.)  Lithium producers typically sign contracts to sell their product for a set amount of time (commonly one year) for a set price throughout the contract. So, going back to that handy-dandy lithium spot pricing chart, I want you to take a gander at about when that pretty little line went parabolic (hint: I fucking marked it). For those of you who are too lazy to scroll up or if you\u2019re just unsure and want to double check your work: August 2nd, 2021. Hmm, that's about a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do we do with this information? We buy companies that produce lithium of course and we bet an unreasonable amount of our portfolio on it to boot. Now to the part all you shit-flingers will probably skip down to: \u201cJust tell me what to buy already!\u201d Here\u2019s a brief summary on my lithium plays and my positions.\n\n   \n \n\n\\- Albemarle ($ALB) \u2013 50 Shares, two 8/19 $250C, one 8/19 $260C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/3 After Hours\n\no One of the world\u2019s current largest lithium producers than has multiple lithium mines in production and several others projects on the way. They absolutely destroyed their Q1 earnings report and should crush it once again for the next 3-4 quarters at a minimum as profits from those beautiful new lithium contracts from last year start to roll in. They are also diversified (hard word, I know) and are involved in several other market segments, but make no mistake this is still a lithium play at the end of the day. Additionally, they are US based so they\u2019re going to get some of that sweet sweet low-interest government money courtesy of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM).\n\n\\- Lithium Americas \u2013 920 Shares, fifteen 8/19 $30C, nine 11/18 $30C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/4 Pre Market\n\no Massive upside on this company as probably the most intriguing junior lithium miner right now. Sure, they haven\u2019t made any profit yet, but that\u2019s a pretty fucking big \u201cyet\u201d. They are currently in the final stages of approvals for the largest lithium mine in North America at Thacker Pass in Nevada. Once this makes it through a final court case appeal this September it will be all system go on this project and I would bet my left nut that that will be the case here. I won\u2019t get too far into this since I have written about it before, but there are several other catalysts on the horizon and revenues are coming very very soon. My PT on this one is $150/share by the end of 2025.  Massive upside here, don\u2019t miss the boat. I\u2019ll likely be turning some of my earnings play profits into many more 11/18 &amp; 2/17 calls.\n\n\\- Livent ($LTHM) \u2013 300 Shares, two 8/19 $25c, thirty 8/19 $30C, five 8/19 $40C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/2 After Hours\n\no Another US based company with projects that are already producing. Major earnings beat in their last call and I fully expect them to blow it out of the water once again and for the next several quarters. They are heavily focused on being as green and sustainable as possible, which is an important factor in this field. I think we could see $40/share by early next year.\n\n\\- Sociedad Quimica y Minera ($SQM) \u2013 50 Shares (No options\u2026yet)\n\no Earnings Call: 8/17 After Hours\n\no More similar to Albemarle since they are well-diversified, but at the end of the day their lithium production is one of their biggest revenue drivers. I\u2019ll probably write an article on them prior to their earnings so, I\u2019ll just say I have option plays to come on this one as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Do you know someone who drives a car? Well odds are, At least one of their next two cars will probably be electric. Electric cars need lithium for their batteries. Buy lithium producers and own your own god-damn horse track. God speed retards, and let that speed be electric.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here, please be kind (especially the AutoMod) to me. You're welcome to discuss from your own viewpoint so that I can broaden my own viewpoint as well. Sometimes I may express investment misconception and you can of course point this out too.\n\nI adopted Value Investing as my method of making money a few years ago, buying cheap good stocks at bargain price. \"Good\" means a company with at least a thin moat (and well known) while generate satisfactory earning growth and having a healthy balance sheet,\n\nNow, as I tried to find those stocks I ended up almost nothing on my shopping list. For example, I went to scan the Australian market for low P/E and low P/B stocks and occasionally some high dividend paying stocks. Those stocks that passed my filter are like cyclical commodities stocks with temporary high profits, another was a well known department store but with a history of exec misconduct and I left with nothing but the bunch of unknown small companies (yes, greater risk -&gt; greater return or nothing!) with swinging profit and some are highly leveraged. What a waste of time.\n\nI tried with other developed markets such as Germany, Netherlands, France, ... but the results are appearing in the same way as in Australia, the bunch of unknown small companies. The good companies are always have a high multiples like $ASML, $MSFT, $NVDA, $TSLA. Those with low multiples are either commodities related or companies with shrinking earning forecast.\n\nAt this point, I start to believe that everything are priced in and the market is efficient in itself. Thinking about stocks as limited resources while there are new investors every year coming to find good stocks (and hold on for dear life) like me, and of course many of them are much advanced than myself and how in the hell am I going to compete with them to find such a good stock as most or all are taken. Shall I concluded that Value Investing are not working anymore? I don't even scanning the US market as I think there's always someone who monitor undervalued stocks using advance programming and take that opportunity instantly.\n\nWhat's your take?",

    "title": "Lordstown Motors: Getting In Before the Surge",
    "selftext": "This was posted on Seeking Alpha. WSB won\u2019t let me post the link. \n\nThere aren't many people, let alone investors, who wouldn't have wanted to get into Tesla (TSLA) a decade ago or even a few years ago, while market analysts and the conventional wisdom was that they'll be close to bankrupt and not be able to sell the amount of electric vehicles they are selling today.\n\nI believe that Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) is one of those candidates for 2022. There certainly are hurdles the company will face, most notably the established presence of companies like Tesla and other automobile companies, some of which have opened their first manufacturing plant over 100 years ago.\n\nBut given the fact that the company has reached a deal with Foxconn (OTCPK:FXCOF) to help with raising capital for mass production of their flagship light pickup truck the Endurance - the prospects of the company meeting their already slimmed down delivery estimates is relatively high, and thus I believe the company's potential is vast relative to its current valuation.\n\nWhat's The Deal?\n\nThe premise here is quite simple. Market experts expect the electric pickup truck market to sell around 25,000 vehicles in 2022, dominated by the likes of the Ford (F) F-150 Lightning. But by 2030, the same market analysis calls for there being a demand for about 1 million electric pickup trucks, a 40-fold increase over the span of about 8 years.\n\nMy belief is that with the help of Foxconn, as well as them focusing solely on the pickup truck model without venturing into places unknown - they'll be able to 'pick up' quite a decent market share of that 1 million vehicle demand as they ramp up production.\n\nExpectations Are Conservative, Valuation More So\n\nRight now, the company expects to deliver about 500 vehicles in 2022, significantly down from their initial expectations when announced back in June of 2021. This is a result of supply chain issues which have plagued all automobile manufacturers as a result of ports closing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts and company projections are calling for 2,500 deliveries in 2023, followed by around 10,000 in 2024.\n\nWith a starting price of $52,500 per car, which is on the conservative side since most people who are spending that much on a pickup truck are likely going to go for upgrades, as we've seen with Tesla cars and others. This brings the following revenue projections for the next 3 years, where I assume a $2,500 reduction in price each year to account for efficiency, as stated by the company:\n\nYear\tDeliveries\tUnit Cost\tExp. Revenue\n2022\t500\t$52,500\t$26.3 million\n2023\t2500\t$50,000\t$125 million\n2024\t10000\t$47,500\t$475 million\n(Source: Company expectations / Author calculations)\n\nFor the following years, assuming an ~8% market share through 2030 means that the company will have the potential to deliver just shy of 80,000 vehicles a year in 2030, which with an average price of around $50,000 comes out to about $4.5 billion in revenue per year. This is assuming the company does not launch any other vehicles throughout that time period, an assessment which I believe is silly but for the purpose of this investment thesis I will assume.\n\nBefore heading in to discuss valuation, which is the reason we're all here today, it's worth noting that these expectations and assessments are not without risk, and significant risks at that, given how crowded the electric vehicle market is.\n\nReasons To Worry\n\nThere are several reasons to worry about the prospects of success, most notably from competitive pressures like I mentioned earlier in the article from established automobile manufacturers who are already introducing new all-electric vehicles - including Ford with their F-150 Lightning which is the closest rival to the company's purposed Endurance light pickup truck.\n\nThe second reason to worry is cash. The company started off strong with around $630 million after its IPO but then has been using that cash to ramp up hiring and manufacturing plans and now only holds $204 million in cash. This can potentially be enough for them to get started as we await money coming from potential pre-orders and other investment in the company but there is a risk that they won't be able to effectively scale up production, even if demand if high.\n\nThere's a third, albeit less significant risk associated with geopolitical pressures which has been proven in the past to be important: tax credits. From administration to administration in the United States, the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles have been in and out of style and although this credit never stopped those who went for either the expensive Tesla cars or the more economical cheap versions, they do have an impact on the transition to all-electric vehicles for those contemplating a new vehicle purchase, given the higher cost. With an elimination of a $7,500 tax credit, the pickup truck categories can be hurt quite significantly, especially with the lower-cost F-150 Lightning and what's sure to be additional makes and model on the market by that point in time in 2025, 2029 or beyond.\n\nValuation Presents Immense Opportunity\n\nThe beauty of my belief in the company is that it's, for now, solely based on the Endurance sales and not on any future vehicles they may launch with or without Foxconn, which means the likelihood of them outperforming these 2030 expectations are quite high, giving us room for error if sales of the Endurance alone fall short.\n\nMost automobile companies like Ford are currently trading at around a 0.3x multiple of price to sales. I'm using price to sales multiples since it's difficult to determine what the company's profit structure will look like moving forward given the complexities of ownership with Foxconn.\n\nAlthough currently the company's price/sales ratio is high, around 4x for 2023, the exponential growth is justifying such a high valuation, given the comparative growth relative to companies like Ford. However, the company is currently trading at around 0.1x price to sales once it reaches the $4.5 billion in sales sometime before 2030.\n\nThis means that, in a conservative estimate, the company has the potential to be fairly valued at around 3x its current valuation, or around $6.00 per share.\n\nConclusion: Risky, But Worth It\n\nThere certainly are much higher risks associated with Lordstown Motors than traditional automobile companies, as well as the overall. But given that they are only now beginning to ramp up production with the new Foxconn deal, it's evident that their current price is not justified and should be trading quite a bit higher.\n\nWith a 300% potential return over the next 8 years, I believe that Lordstown Motors will easily outperform other established automobile manufacturers as well as the overall market, which is why I am highly bullish on the company's long-term prospects.",

In 2016, he stood in line at a showroom near his suburban Los Angeles home to be one of the first to order two Model 3s \u2014 one for himself, the other for his wife.\n\n\u201cI was a total Musk fanboy,\u201d Levitt says.\n\nWas, because while Levitt still loves his Teslas, he\u2019s soured on Musk. \u201cOver time, his public statements have really come to bother me,\u201d Levitt said, citing the CEO\u2019s spats with US President Joe Biden, among others. \u201cHe acts like a seven-year-old.\u201d\n\nBefore it was reported Musk had an affair with Sergey Brin\u2019s wife, which he\u2019s denied; before his slipshod deal, then no-deal, to acquire Twitter Inc.; before the revelation he fathered twins with an executive at his brain-interface startup Neuralink; before SpaceX fired employees who called him \u201ca frequent source of distraction and embarrassment\u201d; before his daughter changed her name and legal gender after his history of mocking pronouns; before an article said SpaceX paid an employee $250,000 to settle a claim he sexually harassed her, allegations he\u2019s called untrue; Musk\u2019s behavior was putting off prospective customers and perturbing some Tesla owners.\n\nThe trends have shown up in one consumer survey and market research report after another: Tesla commands high brand awareness, consideration and loyalty, and customers are mostly delighted by its cars. Musk\u2019s antics, on the other hand? They could do without.\n\nCreative Strategies, a California-based customer-experience measurer, mentioned owner frustration with Musk in a study it published in April. A year earlier, research firm Escalent found Musk was the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among electric-vehicle owners surveyed.\n\n\u201cWe hear from Tesla owners who will say, \u2018Look, I love my vehicle, but I really wish I didn't have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet,\u2019\u201d says Mike Dovorany, who spoke with thousands of EV owners and potential buyers during his two years working in Escalent\u2019s automotive and mobility group.\n\nTesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through Musk\u2019s many controversies. The dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with Covid lockdowns in Shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks. Competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the EV sales ranks.\n\nMusk\u2019s star power, built in no small part by his activity on Twitter \u2014 the same forum where he\u2019s become such a lightning rod \u2014 has contributed immensely to Tesla, especially since it\u2019s shunned traditional advertising. His steady stream of online banter, punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt (see: shooting a Roadster into space) keeps Tesla in the headlines. During the company\u2019s earlier days, the trolling and glib comments were a feature, not a bug. They allowed Musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for Tesla\u2019s legion of very-online fans.\n\nBut after making Tesla and himself so synonymous with one another, Musk has waded into political conflicts, attempted to buy one of the world\u2019s most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life, putting the company\u2019s increasingly valuable brand at risk.\n\nStay on top of the electric car revolution by signing up to our Hyperdrive newsletter here.\n\nJerry James Stone, a 48-year-old chef in Sacramento, California, who teaches his 219,000 YouTube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals, drives a Volkswagen Beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car. He isn\u2019t sure yet which model, but certain it won\u2019t be a Tesla.\n\n\u201cElon has just soiled that brand for me so much that I don't even think I would take one if I won one,\u201d Stone says. \u201cYou have this guy who's the richest dude in the world, who has this huge megaphone, and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who's not, or to fat-shame people, all these things that are just kind of gross.\u201d\n\nAccording to Strategic Vision, a US research firm that consults auto companies, some 39% of car buyers say they wouldn\u2019t consider a Tesla. That\u2019s not necessarily out of the ordinary \u2014 almost half of respondents say they won\u2019t consider German luxury brands. But Tesla does lag more mass-market brands: Toyota, for example, is only off the shopping list for 23% of drivers.\n\nEmma Sirr, a 28-year-old worker in cloud computing who lives in Bozeman, Montana, gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. They've been researching EVs for about three years and until recently considered Teslas the only viable option, given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area. But they refused to buy one because of Musk, their main gripes being his politics, staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomous-driving technology.\n\n\u201cWe took Tesla off the table from the get-go,\u201d Sirr says. She and her partner have their eyes on the Kia Niro and Chevrolet Bolt as possible alternatives. \u201cAs consumers, our power is what we buy. I think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets, and I feel like that might come back to bite.\u201d\n\nFor much of the past decade, Tesla lacked competitors that matched its models\u2019 battery range and other measures of performance. Consumers put off by Musk\u2019s mischief had few EVs to turn to. As legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models, Tesla won\u2019t have as much leeway.\n\n\u201cWe've seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary,\u201d says Dovorany, who left Escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year. \u201cWe're not seeing that as much with incoming buyers.\u201d To win this cohort, automakers need to check every box, and for some, that includes employing a CEO who doesn\u2019t share Hilter memes on social media.\n\nLevitt, the self-described former Musk fanboy, took a test ride last month in a Lucid. He wasn\u2019t sold on it, partly he says because it didn\u2019t have enough cargo space for his golf gear. He\u2019s still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from Tesla and considering models from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.\n\n\u201cIf you take Mr. Musk and his antics out of the equation, I'm about 98% certain that my next car would be a Tesla,\u201d Levitt says. \u201cHis antics put me in play.\u201d",

We believe that this monitoring is effective and includes appropriate controls. Finally, although the Proxy Advisory Firm has expressed concerns about hypotheticals of increasing share pledges, its analysis failed to acknowledge the actual levels of investment collateralized by pledged shares. It is important to note that as of June 30, 2022, based on representations of our directors and executive officers to the Company, the aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by our directors and executive officers\u2019 pledged shares was less than 1% of the total value of the pledged shares.\u00a0\u00a0\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://docs.publicnow.com/viewDoc?hash\\_primary=1A13EF9E4106FFAEB659F14DC598DA409A6D4A0F](https://docs.publicnow.com/viewDoc?hash_primary=1A13EF9E4106FFAEB659F14DC598DA409A6D4A0F)",

    "selftext": " Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world\u2019s most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.\n\nIn a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company\u2019s proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.\n\nTesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today\u2019s closing price the new share price would be around $308.\n\nThough the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don\u2019t impact a company\u2019s market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.\n\nTesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla\u2019s 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.\n\nSeveral other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet\u2019s split 20:1 in February and Amazon\u2019s stock split 20:1 split one month later.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2)\n\nTesla TSLA shareholders approved a 3-for1 stock split. This means that for every TSLA share you own, you will receive 2 additional shares. Elon Musk added that buybacks are on the table depending on future cash flow.\n\nDo you think TSLA will rally leading up to the stock split?",

When it comes to politics, you always have to follow the money \u2013 and remember that the devil is in the details.\n\nThe Senate on Sunday passed the bill that\u2019s designed to fight climate change, make significant tax changes, trim the federal deficit, cut drug prices for Medicare recipients and extend expanded health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. As it moves to the House of Representatives, the roster of the winners and losers under the bill is coming into sharper focus even before it goes to President Joe Biden.\n\nFor both winners and losers, the impact is more modest than you would think, given the sheer size of the numbers being bandied about. That\u2019s because of details like strings attached to some of the new or extended tax breaks, or the schedule for implementing Medicare\u2019s negotiations with big pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.\n\nChanges will be more gradual than many headlines imply.\n\nBeginning with the biggest-dollar provisions of the 10-year package of spending and tax cuts, these are some of the effects American corporations and citizens will see from the law. The two biggest changes are the bill\u2019s deficit reducers \u2013 just two provisions of the law that account for 80% of its $300 billion in deficit reduction, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nLosers:\n\nBig tax-avoiding corporations\n\nDrug companies (but not as much as you think)\n\nPublic company shareholders\n\nWinners:\n\nCar companies (but maybe not Tesla)\n\nUtilities and homeowners\n\nHedge funds (for now)\n\nRead the full article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/the-market-winners-and-losers-in-the-climate-health-and-tax-bill.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/the-market-winners-and-losers-in-the-climate-health-and-tax-bill.html)\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act includes a $7,500 EV tax credit subject to income and price limits ($55K sedans, $80K SUVs).\n\nDo you think this is bullish for EV stocks like TSLA?",

A PE around 12-15 is more reasonable for this company.\n\nCitigroup just initiated coverage with a Buy rating.\nDeutschmark Bank has a $10 price target.\n\nPosition:  1000 Shares.  3 X Jan 2023 $10 C",

    "selftext": "Boys, \n\nI know why you're bullish. Bears are repeating what they've heard from their favorite Tiktok analyst about QE, how our economy can't handle 3%+, etc. When the shoe shine boy says the doom is here, inverse that fucker. But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me \"the chicken comes home to roost.\" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a fa\u00e7ade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, \"but that's another topic\" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wish you all the best, but only a few end up with the bread in the end.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: DCA'ing debit put spreads biweekly in AMZN, TSLA, GOOG, SPY, TQQQ, 60-180 days exp.",

    "selftext": " Jim Farley, president of the Ford motor company, announced the Ford F-150 Lightning as the leader of all EV pick-up trucks, saying \"Take that, Elon Musk.\" The Lightning has sold 2,296 units so far, with June 2022 being its first full month on the market. The F-150 Lightning was announced after Tesla made its splashy reveal of its Cybertruck pickup, but Tesla has yet to deliver a single truck, with the first one due to roll off the production line in 2023. Ford has amassed 200,000 orders for its all-electric pickup. Tesla is thought to have 1.5 million reservations on the books for its Cybertruck.\n\nFARLEY: We're really on a mission at Ford to lead an electric and digital Revolution for many not few. And I have to say The Shining Light for us at Ford is this beautiful lightning made right down the road. In Dearborn, right here in the state of Michigan already.

    "selftext": "Guys I'm not sure how this is possible but this sub has become more regarded than ever before. I remember back in the day when this sub used to hype up actual good companies with a good future like TSLA and AMD. Then after the whole GME fiasco it's nothing but trying to squeeze shitty as companies.\n\nListen the whole reason the GME squeeze happened so effective in the first place is because a lot of people actually believed in GME. GME was very undervalued with another console cycle coming out and not to mention video games are just cool and you can imagine getting creative selling things in a store that sells them. Now it's BBBY? I'm gonna be honest with y'all. I got in last week, I got the bag and I dipped. I've seen multiple post of people saying that they don't believe in the company but they are just there for the squeeze. A squeeze will never work that way! In order for a squeeze to actually squeeze people have to legitimately believe in the future outlook of the company because at the end of the day someone needs to buy those shares higher than the last person that bought them and so on.\n\nWith that being said can I interest you in spreading the work about our lord and savior ASTS. This company is claiming to be able to link your phone directly to a satellite from anywhere in the world and give you service! That's right, you can keep checking your roobinhood accounts, watch porn, work from home from anywhere in the fucking world! They do this by making big ass fucking satellites the size of a basket ball court which unfold in space like the fucking web telescope. If this tech is as good as they say it is it legitimately has the chance to 10x in the next few years easy. They are launching a satellite in a spacex rocket in the next few weeks so soon we will see how well this tech really works.\n\nSome of the bear case for this stock:\n\nSatellite doesn't unfold properly cause delay of a year or more\n\nThe service may not be that great\n\nFCC regulations due to it possibly causing interference with planes and shit.\n\n\\---------------\n\nDue to the risky nature of this stock it has a decent amount of SI as well.\n\nImagine squeezing and actually good company that you wouldn't mind HODLing because it actually has a bright future! HOLY SHIT!\n\nAnyways that's for taking the time to listen. Good luck out there in your trading and have a great day.\n\n**SPACEMOB  SPACEMOB  SPACEMOB  SPACEMOB  SPACEMOB**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: You know what fuck it, go buy BBBY as well who gives a shit lol. When y'all done with BBBY don't forget about this bad boy tho!\n\nPositions: Calls on ASTS, BBBY, BGRY, SIGA",

    "title": "George Soros Deals a Big Blow to Tesla Rival Rivian - $RIVN $TSLA",
    "selftext": "[https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RGLVUSC66DJ5](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RGLVUSC66DJ5)\n\n  \n\n# George Soros Deals a Big Blow to Tesla Rival Rivian\n\nThe legendary investor is a major shareholder in the young electric vehicle manufacturer.\n\nBy TheStreet Staff\n\nIt's been a somewhat hectic August for Rivian .\n\nThe startup, which is presented as one of Tesla's most serious rivals in the race for electric vehicles, is currently accumulating setbacks.\n\nThe electric vehicle manufacturer has just announced mixed earnings for the second quarter. While the company kept unchanged its forecast to produce 25,000 vehicles in 2022, it lowered its main profit target due to continued supply chain woes.\n\n\"Supply chain continues to be the limiting factor of our production\" the company said on August 11 in a letter to shareholders. \"Throughout the quarter, our cost of materials was impacted by inflationary pressures, which we believe will continue to be an impact for the near future.\"\n\nBig Challenge Ahead\n\nChief Financial Officer Claire McDonough detailed these inflationary pressures later to analysts.\n\n\"We've seen unprecedented levels of inflation especially across our raw material, inputs and lithium prices that have gone up north of 115% over since the start of this year, in particular coupled with Covid and other factors that have driven a challenging supply chain and inflationary environment as well as part of that.\"\n\nBut the company said it was making \"progress\" with its suppliers: \"We expect to be able to add a second shift for vehicle assembly towards the end of the third quarter.\"\n\nAs of June 30, Rivian had only manufactured 6,954 cars. In other words, it must manufacture at least 18,046 vehicles during the second half of the year to meet its goals.\n\nThe automaker also said it expected to lose a little more money than initially expected this year. Its annual adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) should come at around $5.45 billion. The company had previously said that it was expecting a full-year EBITDA of negative $4.75 billion.\n\nSoros Sold Millions of Rivian Shares\n\nBesides this bad news, Rivian has just received an additional blow and this one comes from the iconic investor George Soros. Indeed, in a regulatory document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 12, the billionaire's firm, Soros Fund Management (SFM) indicates that it sold millions of Rivian shares during the second quarter.\n\nSFM owns just over 17.835 million Rivian shares - 17,835,511 Rivian shares to be precise - for a value of $459 million as of June 30. This is quite the opposite of the first quarter, a period during which Soros acquired additional Rivian shares while Ford , one of the group's other major shareholders with Amazon , also sold millions of shares.\n\nAs of March 31, SFM held just over 25.88 million Rivian shares.\n\nRivian shares continued to fall in the second quarter, losing 49% of their value between April 1 and June 30. Since the beginning of the year, Rivian Stock is down 62.5%.\n\nThe Irvine, Calif.-based company has a busy roadmap in the next 18 months: ramping and enhancing the R1T pickup/truck and R1S SUV, as well as its electric delivery van, the EDV.\n\nThe blow is all the harder for Rivian as Soros invested for the first time in Tesla and Ford. The billionaire has also strengthened its position in Lucid and Nio , two other competitors of Rivian who are also in the process of increasing production rates.\n\nIt's hard to say whether the legendary investor's decision suggests he's beginning to doubt Rivian or whether he simply wants to diversify his investments in the electric vehicle sector by betting on different players.\n\nStock market regulations require managers of funds with more than $100 million in U.S. equities to file a document, known as a 13F, within 45 days of the end of the quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges.\n\nThe value of Soros' U.S. equity portfolio rose 5.3% quarter over quarter to $5.6 billion. Soros Fund Management is a family office that manages public and private equity.\n\nSoros, whose net worth is estimated at $8.5 billion as of Aug. 12 according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is well known for pouring money into philanthropic efforts. Most of his firm's assets belong to Open Society Foundations, which supports \"people across the world who work for justice, equity and free expression.\"\n\nThis article was originally published by TheStreet. -0- Aug/14/2022 12:54 GMT",

    "title": "BBBY Form 144 --&gt; Form 4?",
    "selftext": "It sounds like Form 144 is all the rage right now, and rightfully so.  I was doing some research on how form 144 is used and if there are use cases where a high level member of a company \"files the form 144 ahead of time\" to use at their convenience.\n\nI came across this reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Series7/comments/qrl7xk/as_of_yesterday_elon_musk_has_sold_5_billion_of/)at the r/Series7 which looks like its a reddit for test prep.  The question they ask in the post is related to form 144.  The part I found relevant to BBBY's situation is quoted below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Elon's FORM 144 was dated September 14. He can sell the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Tesla or the average of the last four weeks trading volume of Tesla as of September 14 in the 90 days following. He has to file FORM 4 within two days for any sales and he continues to do so.\n\n This lead me to ask \"What is Form 4?\"\n\nAccording to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form4.asp):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders.\n* If a party fails to disclose required information on a Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result.\n* **It must be filed within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred.**\n\nI then wondered \"how have form 144 and form 4 been used in other situations?\"  I decided to use TSLA as my case study:\n\nExample 1 - Andrew Baglino -  Sell 1,500 TSLA shares: \n\n[Form 144](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER/16776) \\- Approximate Date of Sale 03/01/21 \n\n[Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000179056521000003/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml)\\- Box 2 - Transaction Date 03/01/21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample 2 - Jerome Guillen - Sell 30,000 TSLA shares:\n\n[Form 144](https://sec.report/Form/144-PAPER/17482) \\- Approximate Date of Sale 03/10/21\n\n[Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000158451821000004/xslF345X03/primary_doc.xml) \\- Box 2 - Transaction Date - 03/10/21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just two random examples that may not be perfect 1:1 examples to RC Ventures, but I'm no expert and just trying to understand the potential scenarios ahead of us.  It does look like if RC Ventures did sell, they would be required by law (given the holding size) to file a Form 4 within 2 business days of selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot financial advice, I could be wrong, good luck and stay safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLRDR: It appears that a Form 4 is required to be filed within 48 hours of a material change happens in the holdings of company insiders, so if RC Ventures sold we would likely find out soon.**",

    "title": "$PSNY: why isn\u2019t this moving?",
    "selftext": "So now that we graduated to the pump phase of WSB rather than the endless fud I noticed that PSNY has been stuck this entire run. $SPY and the market are moving but the only action from $PSNY was a 6% freak out candle last Thursday eod. \n\nThe IV is low in the 50\u2019s which is normal but less than $TSLA\u2019s IV which makes it weird. Lower than the Iv of all the other EV companies actually. The borrow rate is odd it\u2019s at 337% and rising, also since 8/11 on interactive brokers shares have been drying out. IV on the puts is actually two times the IV on the calls so something wrong there. I watched $Psny before it merged and Iv was usually 250%+.Like the stock had a 45% jump in two days about 2months ago yet IV is now in the 50\u2019s??? \n\nSo it\u2019s not like the stock can\u2019t run hard af. If $PSNY runs 50% again the calls could be like 50bags. Just looked at the chain, it actually loaded especially the Jan\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a shit company, they make electric vehicles you can rent them at enterprise and hertz. They delivered 21,200 cars in the first six months of the year compared to 9510 last year, outpacing their higher priced rivals LCID/RIVN. Since the start of 2022 worldwide purchases have increased 350%.  They recently reaffirmed guidance yet nothing \u2026just stuffed. I actually see polestars relatively frequently on the road (upper northwest city) Yes, the economy is going to shit but that didn\u2019t stop $AAPL from going to almost ATH.\n\nSo wtf is going on? Solid company, history of running hard, as early as 2months ago ran 45%, has memes aka the Island Boy Song about Polestar https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yDseMkrduYI , yet  isn\u2019t running during this crazy rally\n\n\nI think the problem is that shorts entered right at market bottom in June so if it goes above $10 by a few dollars exit is likely, since that seems like their average entry price, so been working overtime to keep a lid; my guess. With low Iv if this runs like the others the returns would be solid if not wild. If the lowest it traded was $8.5 in the absolutely worst market possible, fail to see how this isn\u2019t a floor.",

    "selftext": " \n\n1. First of all, if RC doesn't tweet tonight and the price continues to drop, he could be found in violation of the fiduciary responsibilities he took on after his March purchases which included multiple board seats. He could face massive fines/penalties, lawsuits or even prison time.\n2. RC did not sell. We know that now. The fact that the market is not responding to that information leads me to believe that there sell of is a mixture of scared paper hands retards who cant read and computers.... that also cant read.\n3. Look at the charts AH after the initial sell-off. It's a perfectly calculated buy/sell in a sequential wave with almost zero volume. Low volume + computers = pretty little patterns.\n4. The people who really control the price don't have bloomberg terminals so the only market movers AH are computers circle jerking\n5. RC cannot sell off his assets or options for another 30 days by law\n6. If he were to sell today, his options are so OTM that he would barely profit. Why would he do that and then face fines/penalties, etc.\n7. My call is $40 by EoW.\n8. RC is likely not tweeting because he is concerned about SEC scrutiny that would come from any kind of social media post (see Elon Musk vs. SEC on TSLA)\n9. These WSB regards need to be a little less regarded and practice their 3rd grade reading skills\n10. WSB will be filled with panic sellers crying about how they jumped ship @ $18 after BBBY hits 30 -&gt; 35 -&gt; 40\n11. ***L***astly; the real killer of BBBY shares is fucking retards setting stop losses on every single account. These fuckers have FOMO and paper hands simultaneously. When there is a panic sell, that is a signal to buy, not sell.\n12. rant over. see you tomorrow. :rocket: :rocket: :gem: :gem:",

    "title": "A Story",
    "selftext": "\\*Skip to \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* to avoid historical intro\\*\n\nDespite the title of this post, I'm a fucking retard and don't know the first thing about telling stories. But due to recent events, a spark has ignited in my ape heart to share this tale with those of you who may find it one that is enjoyable, laughable, nostalgic, or dare I say another crayon to add to your 24-pack to replace the one you chewed on all day today. This post will contain my own story as well as media from the time period it takes place.\n\nThough this may be my first post on WSB, I have been here for a few years. I do not claim to be a veteran or historian. I discovered this sub at the beginning of COVID. I was sent home from college, told in 2 weeks we'd return to finish the semester, only to later graduate from home and online. \n\nAt times I've watched you retards from afar, losing hundreds of thousands on ridiculous 0DTE SPY calls and puts. I laughed along with the majority of the community at the \"loss porn\" though this was not all I'd witnessed. I saw you fuckers making mad money long before Jim Cramer on $TSLA, $NIO, $PLUG, $PLTN, $ZM, and many others. A healthy influx of tendies was bringing attention to this community of helmet-wearing degenerates. You all certainly caught mine, and I decided to join.\n\nI soon began my first real job in May of 2020. I also began my first investment account. I worked in the engineering field. With a decent wage, booming economy / stock market, and being incapable of spelling the word \"inflation\", I soon began making sweet gains off of everything I'd invested in. In the first 5 months I'd turn $15k into around $32k. Rookies numbers by the book of WSB, and fairly so. I rode beginner's luck to the end of the rainbow, where I would soon find King Crayola himself, DFV.\n\nNow we all know the way this story ends, and so you may wonder why I use the Lord's name in vain. But in the beginning, there was no light. There was tinfoil. There was disbelief. There was Wendy's applications being DM'd (probably). AND... there was conviction. Stronger than any man's I'd seen. DFV's calls were an unstoppable force, his shares immovable objects, his hands made of DIAMOND. No matter what anyone commented, he knew what he was doing. What he did not know, was the quite literal GLOBAL phenemenon (can one of you fuckers tell me how to spell this word) that was about to begin.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Here is where my WSB story begins.\n\n[Half man half ape](https://preview.redd.it/jcjkvts5rki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126a05f9712c6e273b47501ae1aaf302f91df733)\n\nBefore they were referred to as \"meme stocks\" they were just tickers that were booming. $GME had made a \"steady\" but explosive run from around $4 to just under $40. A 1000% increase fueled by what... a float short of 141% if I remember correctly? And despite what any of you may say, this was the core. DFV's bet on $GME was that the shorts would get burnt, that the amount of shares shorted was over the amount even available. In WSB terms, shorts r fuk. And once WSB as a forum opened their ape brains to this idea, it was like archduke franz ferdinand had just been assassinated. A world war was brewing between the untied nation of retardation and Melvin fucking Capital. And many, many others would join the war soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Full Ape](https://preview.redd.it/avuwlidktki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa105c47ecf290dad20bd6c103201e562f7f6e09)\n\nAs I sat at my desk job having just thrown my entire investment account into $GME, I'd officially gone full retard. Literally, I couldn't fucking get shit done at work to save my life. I'd just seen about half my year's salary in unrealized gains in a couple hours. I was an excited and anxious mess, glued to my phone like peanut butter flavored weed to snoop dogg's tongue. And so the rollercoaster of emotions had started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Palms are sweaty, knees weak, ma we can afford name-brand spaghetti](https://preview.redd.it/lfeqiil7uki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc337f02b25e155fff5146d7e6b5abd6b449b80)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ma put back the name-brand spaghetti](https://preview.redd.it/ygr2kjziuki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=217e16aa735ee6991364b4f3b56b64545020b1f1)\n\nI'd seen $80k turn back to $38k in TWO HOURS. I am 23 bro. What the fuck is going on?! I make it through the day of work having accomplished shit piss and lunchtime. I spend my night reading WSB posts, when I see this comment:\n\n[These words by u\\/BigChewyBuns reverberated in my soul.](https://preview.redd.it/6dk5jbevuki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b18b4ace6c1936ed22f6b8b9b3fef07ba5b0e37f)\n\nI decide that I will need some time away from work, so I take the week off. During this time we find many new allies joining our cause. Elon Musk, some billionaire indian investor, Dave fucking Portnoy who turned out to be a paper-handed bitch, AOC before the feet pics, and idk do you guys remember that weird Nordic guy on twitter? Kjetill Stjerne? He was there for a minute too. Enemies like Citadel, CNBC, Robinhood... those fuckers... they all rose and fought back as dirty as they could via media and even DISABLING THE BUY BUTTON. Never ever forget that. This is back when Ryan Cohen wasn't the main character btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kktudhenwki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72c5a67960afad9f0cf59b9810bba1b8d21c808\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlj3gu3pwki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed277b7d7a633159259ac2863f69a61cdd41a56\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpd9fpzpwki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=854c02f4dc433b94159a7760d6d5a22073be2fb1\n\nAnd thus, through the power of people tapping their thumbs on their phones, to the tune of sea shanties and the Tendy Man (a WSB fucking banger), war cry meme videos of 300 Spartans, some LOTR posts where Gandalf says some inspirational shit to Bilbo Fuckbag, and actual billboards of $GME go BRRRR lmfao... it actually did.\n\n[Holy FUCK](https://preview.redd.it/4j6yap5hxki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb9e0a2209e384a82b1f6b3cc7020af80c872cce)\n\nNow I truly wish this story ends here, but this is WSB homies. We fucking like the stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stonks only go up](https://preview.redd.it/exznwy4wxki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98722e5b0890924e520c92c918f6ad4faf67eb39)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Until they don't :\\(](https://preview.redd.it/krotz8azxki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9a5090317ebf7d595b9ae806f08a4a51b1ee24)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ma I said put the fucking spaghetti back](https://preview.redd.it/qdgz3yz0yki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32251263d6e7f2d883ef0767507baf30f2a93fc0)\n\nNow there was a lot... A LOT that happened between these 4 pics. I watched myself lose over $100,000 in 10 minutes. Thegoatbro felt like thedumbfuckhobo. But in the end, we made some money. Which for WSB, is a pretty big accomplishment at times. Even given that fact, I had been defeated. My exit plan was thrown out the window, and to that I had blamed the WSB echo-chamber of \"HOLD THE LINE\" for a long time, though I do know it is my own fault. It hurt in every way possible to accept the mistake I'd made with $GME, but I accept it nonetheless. I have learned a lot about myself through this experience, and a lot about who I believe we are should we choose to follow or participate in this sub.\n\nWe are individuals. We are investors, whether we describe ourselves as that or not. Ryan Cohen made the best move for himself this week, and no one can fault him for that. We are retarded. Very retarded. We are apes, and apes together strong. We are not investment advice. We are not financial advisors. We are charitable, some of us heroes even, with the tendies we rarely walk away with. We are real people not actors. We are a casino and a Wendy's. We are the Tendy Man my friends. We are the rocketships to the moon, the printers that go brrrr.\n\nThrough the losses, the wins, the memes and the occasional suicide hotline post... we choose to play the game. And we just don't know when to stop.",

    "title": "Is WallStreetBets Biased in its BBBY Stickies? [Data]",
    "selftext": "#TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you think.\n\n**Over the past two weeks, WSB tends to sticky more bullish posts than bearish posts. Both in general, and for BBBY.**\n\n---\n\nAs a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. \n\nAs of late, the main complaint seems to be that I \"only\" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. \n\nSo let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!\n\n#FAQ:\n\nQ: Why since August 5th? \n\nA: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. \n\nQ: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)\n\n---\n\n#Methodology:\n\nI took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.\n\nI don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.\n\n---\n\n#Results!\n\nOverall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.\n\n**BBBY Specific - Summarized**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull|7|\n|Neutral|2|\n|Bear|5|\n|Other|56|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n**BBBY Specific - Detail**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull Serious|6|\n|Bull Shitpost|1|\n|Neutral Shitpost|2|\n|Bear Serious|3|\n|Bear Shitpost|2|\n|Daily Thread|32|\n|Unrelated|24|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n\nWhat about those nebulous \"Daily Thread\" and \"Unrelated / Other\" categories?\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull BBBY|5|\n|Bear BBBY|1|\n|Daily|22|\n|Earnings|1|\n|Trash|1|\n|Weekend|2|\n|***Total***|***32***|\n\n**Unrelated**\n\n|**Topic**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bear AMC|1|\n|Bear GME|1|\n|Bear TSLA|1|\n|*Bear Total*|*3*|\n|Bull AMC|2|\n|Bull GME|1|\n|Bull OXY|1|\n|Bull SPY|5|\n|Bull SQ|1|\n|Bull TSLA|1|\n|*Bull Total*|*11*|\n|Education|1|\n|Legendary Post|2|\n|Meme|1|\n|Neutral Wind|1|\n|News|1|\n|Shitpost|2|\n|Tattoo|2|\n|***Total***|***24***|\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis was fun to put together and only took about an hour. \n\nI was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. \n\nI'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.\n\nThere are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. \n\nThis is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)\n\nAnother limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.\n\n---\n\n||Category|BBBY Daily?|Topic|Is Dupe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[\"Buying more BBBY puts Monday lfg\" by thisismyname2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuab08/buying_more_bbby_puts_monday_lfg/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"I don\u2019t want bbby to go bankrupt so I just pulled ...\" by MrSingh_Entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wub13h/i_dont_want_bbby_to_go_bankrupt_so_i_just_pulled/)|Bear Shitpost| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, August 22, 2022\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu8ppj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_august_22_2022/)|Daily Thread|Daily||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares....\" by DatSlattSlimeBooBong](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtju81/ryan_cohen_was_an_insider_when_selling_his_shares/)|Bull Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial...\" by obiwanjustblowme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtnust/why_the_baby_acquisition_premise_is/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Aswath Damodaran - Session 1: Intro to Valuation\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wte3eu/aswath_damodaran_session_1_intro_to_valuation/)|Unrelated| |Education|Not Dupe|\n|[\"Lambo Wen?\" by doublejeopardyalex](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt7agl/lambo_wen/)|Unrelated| |Bear TSLA|Not Dupe|\n|[\"675% gains on 2 BBBY options.

    "title": "Ex-Twitter exec blows the whistle, alleging reckless and negligent cybersecurity policies",
    "selftext": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users' personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform's central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company's senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter's serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, who was previously the company's head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter's leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk's attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk's claims).\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, \"We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.\"\n\nRead the full article: [https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html)\n\n CNN's interview with the whistleblower: [https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1562067741821083649](https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1562067741821083649) \n\nElon Musk's legal team subpoenaed an Ex-Twitter head of security whistleblower alleging TWTR has major security problems and that it don't have the resources to identify the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to.\n\nHow do you think this case will end-up and how will TWTR and TSLA price will react?",

    "selftext": "Shares of Tesla (TSLA) will now become more affordable to investors after the stock split takes effect. Tesla\u2019s stock on a split-adjusted basis will begin trading on August 25, 2022. Every shareholder of Tesla as of August 17, 2022, will get 2 additional shares of common stock for every one share held. After the closing session on August 24, the additional shares will be credited to the shareholder account.\n\nTesla stock price is quoting around $874.36 after the share closed 2.26% higher on August 23. TSLA shares are up by 14% and 41% over the last 1-month and 3-month periods. Over the last year, the share price of TSLA is up by 25 percent but is still down by 15.84 percent since January 2022.\n\nStock splits are popular among retail investors and help them add more to their portfolio and also bring in a new set of investors. As retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla stock, the Stock Split will also make the stock more accessible to the retail shareholders.\n\nElon Musk holds 23.5 percent while The Vanguard Group holds 6 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares. It remains to be seen how the stock price reacts once the share starts trading on a split-adjusted basis.\n\nPrior to the Tesla stock split 2022, the company had enacted a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020, after which TSLA shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis. After the previous stock split by Tesla, from August 2020 to June 6, 2022, Tesla\u2019s stock price rose nearly 43.5%.\n\nA 3-for-1 stock split of Tesla shares has already been approved by Tesla\u2019s board of directors and the shareholder\u2019s voting took place at Tesla\u2019s 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on Thursday, August 4, 2022, at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory Texas.\n\nA stock split has no fundamental change to the company\u2019s financials other than increasing the number of shares that are outstanding by issuing more shares to the existing shareholders. After the stock split, the price falls, however, there is no change in the market capitalization of the company as the number of outstanding shares get increased.\n\nSource: [https://www.financialexpress.com/investing-abroad/featured-stories/tesla-stock-split-2-additional-shares-get-credited-to-account-trading-on-a-split-adjusted-price-soon-check-](https://www.financialexpress.com/investing-abroad/featured-stories/tesla-stock-split-2-additional-shares-get-credited-to-account-trading-on-a-split-adjusted-price-soon-check-dates/2642501/)[dates/2642501/](https://www.financialexpress.com/investing-abroad/featured-stories/tesla-stock-split-2-additional-shares-get-credited-to-account-trading-on-a-split-adjusted-price-soon-check-dates/2642501/)\n\n \n\n# Tesla Stock Split: Everything You Need to Know About the Upcoming Split\n\n**When will the Tesla stock split officially go into effect?**\n\nLet's start with the question that shareholders clearly care about the most: \"When will Tesla's forward stock split take effect?\" The answer is (drum roll) ...tomorrow. On Aug. 25, 2022, prior to the opening bell, Tesla's shares will officially begin trading at their post-split price.\n\nSomething for current and prospective investors to keep in mind is that stock quote providers, and even some online brokerages, can take a couple of hours to perhaps even a full day to recognize that a forward stock split has taken place. It's possible you might wake up and see a quote for Tesla down 65% to 70%. It's also possible the value of your portfolio could plummet if your online brokerage hasn't properly adjusted for the coming stock split and Tesla represents a sizable position. Either way, these are nothing more than data errors that should be corrected within 24 hours. Don't panic.\n\n**How many extra shares will you own?**\n\nThe next big question is probably along the lines of, \"What does Tesla's stock split mean for my position?\" With the company announcing a 3-for-1 forward split, and shareholders approving said split at the company's annual meeting on August 4, it means the number of shares held in your portfolio will increase by a factor of three. Conversely, Tesla's share price will be reduced by a third following its August 24 close.\n\nFor example, if you owned 20 shares of Tesla at $890 per share as of this past weekend, your split-adjusted stake would be 60 shares of Tesla held (three times your existing position) at $296.67 per share (a third of the previous price). You'll note that Tesla's market cap doesn't change despite the share price and outstanding share count being adjusted.\n\nAs of August 25, a single share of Tesla should be considerably more affordable for everyday investors without access to fractional-share purchases through their online broker.\n\n**Does this stock split affect Tesla's business in any way?**\n\nYou might be wondering what impact Tesla's stock split could have on its day-to-day operations, balance sheet, or operating income statement. The answer is, very simply, none whatsoever.\n\nThink of stock splits as nothing more than window dressing that allows companies to make their shares more accessible for retail investors. It's also a way of encouraging higher average trading volume, which CEOs like Elon Musk understand can keep Tesla at the heart of the conversation on online message boards and within investing communities.\n\nTesla's share price and the number of shares it ultimately has outstanding have absolutely no impact on the company's ability to produce and sell EVs or innovate. Although stock-split euphoria can, indeed, push the share price of imminent stock-split stocks higher in the short run, it's going to be Tesla's ability to grow its sales and profits, maintain its competitive advantages, and innovate, which'll determine the direction its share price heads over the long-term.\n\n**Is there anything else investors should know about stock splits?**\n\nLastly, Tesla's shareholders and prospective investors should understand that stock split-mania is a short-term event. Although investors are hyped up at the moment, a stock split doesn't mask the fact that one of the most widely held stocks on the planet is facing a slew of headwinds.\n\nSource: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/24/tesla-stock-split-everything-you-need-to-know/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/24/tesla-stock-split-everything-you-need-to-know/)\n\nTesla (TSLA) will perform its 3-for-1 stock split tomorrow. Tesla's shares will officially begin trading at their post-split price on Wednesday the 25th. How do you think TSLA will trade going into the split?",

    "title": "Real DD: ON is the company TSLA will choose next and is positioned to overtake AMD and NVDA.",
    "selftext": "# TL;DR:\n\nAMD and NVDA are Thanos without the infinity gauntlet. **ON is Tony Stark about to snap.** \n\nWhat we have here is an extremely well-run and well-positioned company with viable in-demand technology that posts both strong **value and growth** numbers. I will be keeping a very close watch and you should, too.\n\n# What's Their Schtick?\n\n**ON Semiconductor Corp.** provides industry intelligent sensing and power solutions that enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the efficiency of solar strings, industrial power, and storage systems.\n\n*Its intelligent sensing technologies support the next generation industry allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible.*\n\n# The Problem with AMD and NVDA\n\nWe are at a point in history where fabless chip companies like *AMD* and *NVDA* can design ever faster and more power-efficient chips **but manufacturing lags.**\n\nThe largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), being headquartered in Taiwan, has long been extremely vulnerable to geopolitical pressures from China creating even more pressure and doubt on the viability of chip manufacturing in its current state.\n\nIn addition, *Intel Corp. (INTC)* has been mismanaged for far too long, leaving chip manufacturing without a true leader and opening opportunity for adopters of **new manufacturing technology like ON to grab market share from these failing giants**. More on this below:\n\n# U.S. Government Chips and Science Act\n\nNow that the U.S. Government passed Chips and Science Act giving additional financial and tax support to semiconductor manufacturing that has caused the entire semiconductor industry to bounce up off of support.  One good thing about the bear market that we have been in is that valuations \u2014 especially for economically sensitive areas like consumer discretionary and technology that see big swings in valuations during bull and bear runs, respectively \u2014 come down very quickly, and too far, for some great companies.\n\nOne area that is sure to lead us out of the bear market is semiconductors.\n\nThe group's long-term fundamentals as essentially unchanged by medium and long term economic forecast . Still, valuations in the sector have plummeted and that has created opportunity for the right companies to make substantial gains.\n\n# Positioning into Power\n\nThe power business for semiconductors is no longer cell phones or PCs, that are shrinking about 6% y/y at this time, but the booming automotive market. Namely, chips for EVs are projected to grow exponentially faster than any other type of semiconductor.\n\nFor ON Semiconductor, this means, it\u2019s all about positioning into this power area, that as of Q1 of 2022, produces 65% of the companies revenue as the EV baseline growth rate is around 22% Y/Y. To further this argument, ON already deals with top automakers in on the EV bandwagon such as **Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, GM**  and now firm rumors of a **forthcoming chip manufacturing deal with Tesla.**\n\n**Silicon Carbide - The Next Gen Choice**\n\nON\u2019s positioning within the EV wave is solidified by its employment of chips made from Silicon Carbide (SiC). Electric Vehicles are very large electronic devices with large inverters that required chips to manage power at much higher voltage than your average electronic device. Thus, traditional semiconductors \u2014 made from traditional silicon \u2014 are exponentially less efficient in terms of handling these higher voltages and staying cool while in service.\n\nFacts about SiC chips...\n\n* **10x stronger** allowing a drift layer that is **90% smaller**.\n* SiC **supports 9x the voltage** due to its higher dielectric strength.\n* SiC chips have **2.2% higher thermal conductivity over silicon** allowing them to disperse heat much better and preventing expensive heat sinks that detract from auto design quality.\n* SiC boasts 2X band gap allowing for **much less power loss (around 20%)** while conducting.\n\nThis all adds up to huge benefits from EV designers with the employment of smaller, better conducting chips that can handle these higher voltages required in such a large electronic device and empowering better range, shorter charge times, less cooling countermeasures and many other benefits.\n\nTesla converted to SiC chips back in 2018 and NIO (the Tesla of China) converted to SiC chips in 2021 with most other major EV manufacturers converting their inverters to SiC chips as of this writing. **We are on the precipice of SiC benefiting from widespread adoption**.\n\n# Company Fundamentals\n\n**Margins and Profitability**\n\nON has maintained impressive margins across all of its legacy business reporting a gross margin of 43.8% up 5.6% from FY2018. VERY IMPRESSIVE. As a result, ON also reported much-improved profitability, with net incomes of $1.45B and net income margins of 20.1%, indicating a tremendous increase of 230.1% and 9.4 percentage points from FY2018 levels, respectively.\n\n**Industry Growth**\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the automotive (EV) and growing industrial segments will be significant for at least the next decade \u2014 with EV revenue projected to grow 38.3% and industrial at 48.1% with all its legacy business projected to grow 14.8% Y/Y.  ON has proven to execute well from an operational management perspective maintaining an extremely efficient operating ratio and even growing the companies profitability in this current environment with inflation and rising cost of production.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nON has also reporting rising Free Cash Flow representing 90.7% over FY2018, boosting cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The same is true of the company\u2019s debt remaining pretty stable around $3B and EBITDA declining from 3.98 in FY2019 to 1.36 due to the greatly improved margins and profitability. These trends are projected to continue.\n\nON is **both a value and a growth stock** trading at \u2014  11x C2023 EPS compared to 14.4x for its peers and 3.0x EV/C2023 sales compared to 4.5x across the same peer group.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nON will be one of the names to lead out of this bear market. The relative strength that is has showing is super impressive. The demand for chip SiC manufacturing across EV and industrial is white hot and only going to grow. The company is run extremely well only continuing to increase it growth number while still trading at a decent value compared to peers.\n\nON is not a growth name to miss when we start to see upside in technology, my thinking is it is the name to watch in the whole sector. That said, it is very tied to the auto industry, industrials and durables \u2014 all industries dependent on a strong economy \u2014 which is why we see the volatility and strong reaction to economic outlooks and is very important to keep in mind while we keep a close eye on this incredibly well-positioned and essential company.\n\nEssentially, we have an extremely well-run and well-positioned company with viable in-demand technology and posts both strong value and growth numbers. I will be keeping a very close watch.",

    "selftext": " The vote, hailed as a victory that could guide other states, comes two years after an executive order for zero-emission vehicles\n\nCalifornia is expected to ban the sale of new gasoline vehicles by 2035 as the state takes dramatic steps to reduce emissions and combat the climate emergency.\n\nIn a vote on Thursday, state regulators are expected to approve a plan to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars over the next 13 years in America\u2019s largest auto market. The move is being hailed as a major victory that could point the way forward for others.\n\n\u201cThis is monumental,\u201d said Daniel Sperling, a member of the California Air Resources Board (Carb), to CNN. \u201cThis is the most important thing that Carb has done in the last 30 years. It\u2019s important not just for California, but it\u2019s important for the country and the world.\u201d\n\nThe vote comes two years after the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, issued an executive order requiring the sale of new cars to be zero-emission.\n\nIn 2021, only 12% of new cars sold in California were zero-emission, according to Carb. The new rule would require the state reach 35% of sales by 2026, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. It would not affect cars that are already on the road.\n\nThe measure, which Sperling said he was almost certain would pass, will be among the first of its kind and set an example to other states that often look to California when setting their own standards. Sperling told CNN the proposal faced \u201csurprisingly little debate\u201d and resistance from car makers, which have ramped up production of electric vehicles. General Motors has said it plans to sell only electric vehicles by 2035.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/24/california-ban-sales-gas-powered-cars-2035#:\\~:text=California-,California%20to%20approve%20plan%20to%20ban,gas%2Dpowered%20cars%20by%202035&amp;text=California%20is%20expected%20to%20ban,and%20combat%20the%20climate%20emergency](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/24/california-ban-sales-gas-powered-cars-2035#:~:text=California-,California%20to%20approve%20plan%20to%20ban,gas%2Dpowered%20cars%20by%202035&amp;text=California%20is%20expected%20to%20ban,and%20combat%20the%20climate%20emergency).\n\nCalifornia, the largest auto market in the United States, will ban the sale of new gasoline cars by 2035.

    "selftext": "I'm assuming you were too young at the time or maybe forgot since humans clearly forget shit all the time, especially when it goes against their thinking.\n\nDo you all not remember the famous **Volkswagen** (**VW**) squeeze of 2008? Shit went ballistic and **gained like 400%+ in 2 days**. VW became the world's #1 most valuable company for a short time during the squeeze. ***(Estimations shorts lost almost $40 billion.)***\n\n**-** **HerbalLife** **(HLF)** got squeezed when Ackman and Icahn duked it out....Icahn won and walked away +$1billion, ***Ackman covered for double his entry, so figure out that loss*** LMAO.\n\n**-** **Tesla** **(TSLA)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $40 Billion in 2020)*** \\- *I don't need to hear about how great TSLA is*. TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.\n\n**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better.\n\n**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the \"value\" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point.\n\nNow I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Strategic news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**\n\nShills, let's see you change my mind...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Stocks have been squeezed crazy high for ages. Let me repeat to you extra regarded apes in the back. SQUEEZED FOR FUCKING AGES with billllllions in losses. It CAN happen again and will continue to happen over and over and over forever until shorting a stock is illegal.BBBY to the MOON mothfuckas!

The numbers are perfect but fairly close to make my point.*\n\n**GME RECAP** of all the times it **\"died\"** like **BBBY** lol\\*\\*:\\*\\*  \n$4 --&gt; $160      *(+3800% or so)*  \n$160 --&gt; $60   **(-62%. It's definitely dead and done. Was fun while it lasted)**  \n*But wait, there's more!*  \n$60 --&gt; $500    *(another +700-800% or so run)*  \n$500 --&gt; $39   **(-92%. Okay, NOW it's safe to say it, definitely 100% without a doubt D.E.A.D. Nothing can come back from -92%)**  \n*Think again mothafuckas!*  \n$40 --&gt; $180    *(yet ANOTHER +400% rip over 2 days. That was quick)*  \n$180 --&gt; $85    **(-56%, 3rd time is a charm. Never again will this shit see a price above $100 or I'll eat a monkey dick.

The more I read about apple the more the company seems like it is effortlessly ahead of its competitors. Their ability to poach other markets is unique. Surveys suggest the apple car is even more popular than Tesla\u2019s. Simultaneously have exceeded a 50% share of the mobile phone market. Their watchful waiting in the electric car market, in my opinion, is going to pay off massively. I do not necessarily agree ethically with this company or other monopolies like it, however, the relative stability of the investment, even though it won\u2019t return 280% in a year, I believe it can be even more attractive than punts and other gambling activities, especially when you combine it with other consequential trades like a $TSLA short. I still gamble on meme stocks however I have learnt 10-20% is ok, but not 100% and I certainly think a lot of money can be saved in the process.\n\nDisclaimer; this is my opinion and personal beliefs, this does not constitute investment advice and dyodd \n\nInterested to hear what people think",

    "title": "CNN reports - Apple is set to unveil iPhone 14 at \u2018far out\u2019 event | Will they also reveal their satellite partnership with Globalstar (NYSEAMERICAN: GSAT)",
    "selftext": "Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has done every year in September for about a decade.\n\nThe latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It\u2019s rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model \u2013 meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.\n\nFinally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company\u2019s flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday\u2019s event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.\n\nApple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple\u2019s bigger breakout successes in recent years.\n\nApple\u2019s event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: \u201cFar out.\u201d \n\nThis has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.\n\nWhile the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.\n\nMany analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.\n\nApple\u2019s stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.\n\nBut with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales \u2014 and all the subscription revenue that comes with that \u2014 be enough to turn Apple\u2019s stock from red to green?\n\nInvestors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. \n\nAnalysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.\n\nThe company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.\n\nOne analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with \"macro storm clouds building.\" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.\n\"This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,\" Ives added.\nApple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.\nAccording to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\nApple is that rare beast, a stock that still is exciting enough for the growth crowd but is also attractive to value investors thanks to its reasonable price, penchant for stock buybacks to boost earnings and a steadily growing dividend.",

    "selftext": "Tesla is now in second place for total sh0rt 1nteres1 (mods \ud83e\udd71)I like this stock.\n\nIt is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I\u2019m thinking about a few things:\n\nPresidential cycles: \n\n(formatted weird due to some rules)\n\nFor like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.\n\nTesla\u2019s trend:\n\nAbsolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I\u2019m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.\n\nNOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:\n\nIt really isn\u2019t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon\u2019s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it\u2019s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don\u2019t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I\u2019d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYou gotta love him. He\u2019s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he\u2019s an absolute savage. I\u2019m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he\u2019s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.\n\nTLDR: Why the fuck haven\u2019t we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don\u2019t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife\u2019s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years? Then you will have literally missed the fucking rocket.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Take that as you wish, but I\u2019m jumping on the fucking rocket (hopefully before he does) \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019ve blown up my account 4 times and accidentally kissed my wife\u2019s boyfriend(Don\u2019t ask)\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc95\n\nEdit: Position - long 100 shares at $39.16\n                   - 2 500c 6/19/24\n                   -5 450c 1/20/23\n\nEdit: Spy at 395\ud83e\udd14 Tesla at 204 \ud83e\udee1 Spy at 470 \ud83d\udc8e Tesla at\u2026\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80 (buy fractional shares if you have to.

The expected wait times has shortened which could indicate a bear case and a bull case\u2026 the Bear case is that there is a crazy amount of cancellations which have been the result of closing showrooms in China. The bull case is that production in the giga factories have been getting better and they are delivering cars at a much more comfortable pace. Then earnings, expected 10/18-10/24 (not official). Not sure if the currency changes will be such a big factor to the downside\u2026. But perhaps deliveries will aid that. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m bullish Tesla. It\u2019s a mega cap that has been performed relatively well. I think that this \u201clow price per share\u201d will also make investors perceive a \u201clower price\u201d for a company effectively going full steam.\n\nThis is just my opinion and I\u2019m a random dude on the internet\u2026.

For example, last week on Wed Sept 14th, 250,000 300/305/10 calls expiring Friday, sept 16th were traded. This has continued day after day and only kicked into further overdrive, it's **unprecedented** this day after day action especially in the face of such market risk. The call buying only goes into extra regardation in times like late April, early August, and now. The former being when Musk dumped shares. It is of course coincidence that the call buying program volume of weekly options dies out right after Elon is done selling.\n\nAll the while, Musk is set to be deposed next week for the final slug off in the twitter trial and if Musko loses, he needs the stock price as high as possible. Not to mention, he has been shamelessly pumping on Twitter about absolutely ridiculous shit like expanding a car factory to the river and making it open to the public with \"little electric Tesla boats with a retro-futuristic Victoria design\" lmao.

The company has three separate self made billionaires investing in it\n\n3. The company already has contracts with China and Japan and 30 of the largest car manufacturing businesses in the world\n\n\n###So why has the stock tanked so hard since 2020????\n\nThat's a stupid question we are in a bear market very few things are going to come out of this unscathed \n\n\n###Why did a analyst lower its price target???\n\nAlso a stupid question \ud83d\ude44 it's obvious because most analysis are overpaid people with fancy degrees that like to pretend they understand the market when in reality no one truly knows what will happen we are all just guessing.\n\n\n###So why should I listen to you???\n\nYou shouldn't do your own DD but I'm serious when I say that by 2030 its going to make people super wealthy!

    "title": "Why the British Pound will fall much, much lower against the U.S. Dollar.",
    "selftext": "I am a red-blooded U.S.-based investor and I have performed practical research that indicates that the GBP will continue to free fall relative to the USD.  **I am targeting exchange rates below 0.25 GBP to 1.00 USD.**\n\nI was doing some spring cleaning this weekend and I found my keepsake box.  I took a break to look through it and reminisce, and under 5 pairs of your mom\u2019s panties I found some old GBP bank notes that I kept as souvenirs after my career on the professional corgi-riding circuit was tragically cut short due to a knee injury.\n\nSo, I decided to do some research.  I took the GBPs to five establishments to see what I could buy with them.  The results were shocking:\n\nAt McDonalds, I asked for a quarter-pounder with cheese.  When I presented the money the cashier looked back at me and said \u201cwhat is this?\u201d  I told him that it was British currency and he said he couldn\u2019t accept it.  I quickly realized the problem and re-ordered a \u201croyale with cheese.\u201d  The cashier told me that they didn\u2019t have that on the menu.  I realized that I had to account for the lower exchange rate, so I revised my order to an eighth-pounder, no cheese.  Still no luck.  I finally asked for the largest amount of food I could buy with the money and I was kindly asked to leave.  Not a good start for the GBP.\n\nI tried several other places: Costco, Jamba Juice, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the Apple store, etc.  I even tried to go to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond WITH one of those 20.0%-off coupons that they shit into my email inbox every other week - no takers for my British Pounds.\n\nNo one wanted to take this British money.  Feeling confident in my due diligence, I stopped for a frosty at Wendy\u2019s on my way home.  I paid with USD, because I would never try to swindle little Wendy or her late father Dave.\n\nAs I was pulling away from the drive-thru, next to the dumpster I saw who I can only assume was a WSB degenerate with a sign that said \u201cwill bend over for TSLA shares.\u201d  I showed him the GPB notes and asked him what I could get with that.  He said he didn\u2019t want my clown paper, but that he could help me out \u201con the house\u201d because he needed the \u201cexperience\u201d for the forthcoming recession.  I quickly drove away - I don\u2019t need some unpaid intern bugging me every five minutes saying \u201chow else can I help, how else can I help?\u201d\n\nSo, in closing: I tried to use British currency to purchase goods and services at multiples stores in my area of America.  NONE were willing to accept my cash.  This leads me to believe that the GBP will fall much, much further, and may even be completely worthless.",

    "selftext": "(NASDAQ: RIVN &lt; TSLA?)\n\nLet me explain by clarifying, I am very new to investing I only have about 6 months of experience with Etherium. So take everything I say as a suggestion, not fact with that being said; here is my Idea:\n\nAs we all know now, the combustion engine is slated to be killed, with some companies even stopping production as early as 2025. So suggesting an EV manufacturing company is going to take off isn't a hard thing to believe. What I myself do believe is that Rivian at the moment is falling into obscurity, with a net income of -1.7B, and a 52wk low of just $18.\n\nIf together we let this fall, to its low which by the look of things it's going to do. You could buy it dirt cheap.\n\nBut why, how could a failing EV company grow with subpar vehicles, especially in a growing competitive market?; well Rivian has partnered with Mercedes Benz to bring the first luxury Suv EV to the market. I think that this EV will take off rocketing Rivian to the top with, an ungodly amount of buy-ins.\n\nOnce again very new to this, and do not have a degree by any means this is just a hunch I have and with the help of this sub I think we could turn this stock into the next GME, let me know what you think (Might be the dumbest shit ever, might be the best buy ever we will see eh?.\n\n\\-Logonix Sepetember 30th 2022\n\n(0\\_&lt;)",

In the comments I describe the short positions that had been building against $TSLA and $AAPL. I think a lot of you now understand why Wallstreet was gearing up for war on retail's two favorite stocks.\n\nNow I am going to tell you what their goal probably is and to summarize what the economic trends we're seeing in the consumer based on earnings reports.\n\nBuckle up, you probably want to both hear and not hear what I have to say.\n\n# Inflation -- People Are Making Decisions, \"Do I buy luxury brand or do I buy store brand?\"\n\nSo, inflation. The Big I-Word. It's been a disaster for the market. A genie that should never have been let out of the bottle, but it is and we're not done with it yet (clearly). There are a lot of signs emerging that it's affecting the consumer. While it's not affecting the net spend from consumers--yet--it is affecting their choices.\n\nTake $WMT. WMT saw a pretty good upswing in it's earnings last report with quite a good beat, but why is this? Aren't things horrible for retail stores? Well, if you think so, you'd be right. But one person's loss is another person's gain. When you're entering tough times and things are expensive you do what you have to do, you buy cheaper. You go for store brand products. Instead of shopping at your local high end Bashes grocery store or Super Target, you hit up Wal Mart, Costco, places that have their entire model built on stretching a consumer/shopper's dollar to the max.\n\nThis was our first big key to what's going on. Let's talk about the next.\n\n# The Bullwhip Effect\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What the Books say is happening. This is how you get a glut of inventory](https://preview.redd.it/2evme75dewq91.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f08fa1a17a7c191d0bf059cff198850d6fb56243)\n\nBullwhip Effect -- AKA Covid \"BUY IT ALL! WE'RE STUCK AT HOME!\"\n\nWe're seeing a huge bullwhip effect in the market. Places are being flooded with inventory. Yes, this is old news, but it is also current news. $TGT's last quarter was the perfect example for how this god awful situation plays out. Companies ordered a ridiculous amount during the pandemic because all of us sat at home on our phones ordering everything we ever wanted in our lives. Because stocks were so low, places started to double, triple up on their orders in order to try and meet a new high demand that they were forecasting.\n\nWell, it didn't last forever. Plus... this didn't help...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Yeah... that's your stuff out there.](https://preview.redd.it/p50gpamfewq91.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b835ca06f519998080f9c16d8315ad5ef5c843ae)\n\nShip Congestion. That's your stuff out there. Sitting for months.\n\nThis stuff sat on boats for freaking months. You might say, 'Hey, Tay\\_tay86, I know all this crap. Why are you telling me old news?\" Because guess what, it's here now. That stuff has been unloaded and sent to the stores.\n\nBut guess what? It's freaking late. Like really late.\n\nSo what does a company like $TGT do? Well, in their case they list on clearance. It costs money to have this crap around. Plus if it sits too long, it has to be completely written off. You know, red tag 80-90% clearance aka please get it out of my store. That gave $TGT a fat \\~45% cut in EPS because they have to eat all of their costs associated with producing and then shipping that item at stupid high prices to your fat ass. If it takes too long, they get shellacked.\n\n# Here comes out next challenger... Nike. $NKE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here we go again...](https://preview.redd.it/uzj64zvgewq91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=177d873f7aa902a06d9ad318ac66bbac91030e0a)\n\nOur old friend. Mr Highly Engineered Shoes Guyz\n\n$NKE reported after the bell today. All eyes were definitely on them. They've been talking about this one all over the place so going in, it's a hot topic. Well, it's a pretty bad story.\n\nThere's a lot of similarities here. I highly encourage you to listen to their entire call.\n\nTheir margin's are compressed AF. 22% drop in profits is a pretty dire warning to unprofitable companies or ones that are barely profitable.\n\n1. Any time a CEO/CFO is throwing out catch phrases after every BAD result is a sure fire sign that they are trying to distract you from the car wreck that is their report. I Counted at least 4-5 times of 'We're still the super cool choice for shoes' (Paraphrasing, clearly)\n2. They suddenly have too much inventory. Sounds familiar? It should. That's why they are clearing out of the stock afterhours. They are forecasting a repeat of what $TGT just had. $NKE may have squeaked by at 0.93 EPS today, but the next one could be a real gut punch as they try to clear these shoes. Even worse than $TGT, they sell season specific items. This means some of this crap is probably summer oriented when we're going into fall and winter. Yeah, not a good situation. It could potentially be WORSE than what $TGT just experienced. Combine that with the drop in profits and Fx challenges, you've got a real problem.\n3. China revenue dropped. I feel like that one didn't get the highlight it deserves. The CEO kept trying to amp up that China is hungry for sports themed stuff that they sell, but yet their revenue there dropped 13%. Didn't they roll out a lot of direct to consumer options? Well apparently they aren't biting. This is a very eerie warning.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, let's start to summarize. Hopefully you're still reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Cracking Of Apple](https://preview.redd.it/uppjfyxhewq91.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b327e0f44c102a34631d00e2fd295a0f94fd33aa)\n\n# The Cracking of $AAPL\n\nWe've had MULTIPLE warnings about China's demand for our multinational in the past few weeks. Let's list them out:\n\n1. FedEx reported economic weakness in China. If anyone knows how things are going, it's the folks who are delivering stuff that businesses are selling.\n2. Nike is reporting weaker revenue from China (where their stuff is basically made)\n3. Apple is supposedly pulling back a prior manufacturing target by 5-10% due to a lack of demand in places like, you guessed it, China\n\nNow apple's debatable because there's some reports that the Max is doing fine. However, I think that's probably a bullish dream. Their mainstream model is only doing as well as the first.\n\nWhat's at fault? Honestly, probably the chips and overall market. Nothing inside the phone is dramatically different. It's a big nothing burger and there's not a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you do want to, you might as well shell out for the Max to actually get something.\n\nI believe this is going to result in **a net loss of sales because not everyone will choose to buy expensive when the mainstream model is subpar.** **The upgrade is... minor.**\n\nThis is not a homerun for Apple. Wallstreet probably feels very confident about this behind closed doors, but not in public. That's why they've been building short positions against Apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Closing Time](https://preview.redd.it/tje90u9kewq91.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbb27790f23e8301f7f07db945c1d28d76405ef5)\n\n# Closing out\n\nAlright, so let's close this baby out. I know a lot won't read this, but hey, hope you do. If you had read my last one you would have made a killing betting against $AAPL this week.\n\nSo what's the trend we're seeing?\n\n1. **There's too much stuff.**\n2. **Luxuries are not the draw they once were. Things need to be noticeably different to get the $.**\n3. **Because of inflation people (middle class) are choosing to shop at cheaper locations**\n4. **Affordability is top of mind (See CarMax which I am not covering here)**\n\nSo this is it. This is all great for the battle against inflation, but it's bad news bears for your stocks. You're looking at potentially shaky EPS results as we head into this earnings season and the next. These are not single quarter problems. Inventories can take a long time to physically move through the system.\n\nWhich brings me to what this means:\n\nWe're probably going lower in the market.\n\nWall street is coming for retail. They know from all of the data and the clear charts that retail has piled into $AAPL and $TSLA as safety. They are building short positions against it because they have better info than we do. Rumors are already leaking that $TSLA could be approaching weak deliveries for a lot of the same reasons.\n\nYou've got Price and Earnings to every P/E ratio. Price has come down a lot, but now we're going to look at E heading south. There's two ways to skin a company.\n\nLet's talk about $TSLA for a second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Is A Cult](https://preview.redd.it/t0zal9gpewq91.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6922c2439180b2800ab212b5f72dfd1257c23637)\n\n# The Cult Of Tesla\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n1. Look, I don't hide my feelings. I greatly dislike Tesla and their CEO Elon Musk. I don't trust him. I think he manipulates the market and uses it to empty his fans pockets\n2. I think the cars are cheaply made with a lot of flaws.\n3. I don't like cultish love for a human being\n\nElon has made a mistake. That mistake? Making promises he doesn't keep. There's 1 major promise that Elon should have kept: **Making An Affordable EV.**\n\nI am not going to take you through the logic. It's up above. Read this and you'll understand why I am pointing a finger here. These cars are **EXPENSIVE** and they don't offer you a big new thing than the one you already have does. FSD COSTS EXTRA. These are **luxuries**. What do we know about luxuries? People are choosing to buy cheaper. Carmax DIRECTLY said that affordability is on people's mind for car shopping now. **Especially as interest rates soar making car financing WAY more expensive than it was a year ago.**\n\nI believe this is going to bite Elon Musk right in his lying manipulative ass. His way out, pulling a huge rabbit out of the hat. This could happen soon, or it could happen next year, but it's coming for him.\n\n**Keep in mind he's already tilted his hand calling Austin and Berlin's gigafactories cash burning machines.**\n\nJust to add, Elon Musk isn't your friend. He doesn't care about you or your memes at all. He's been the richest man on the planet. He Does Not Care About You. He Doesn't Even Live In The Same 'World' As You.\n\n# Final Words\n\nWall street is coming for Apple. Wall Street is coming for Tesla. They know you're holding it. They are two, massive, giant piggy banks sitting in a market where the bears have eaten everything else alive. Every bear is starting to turn their heads and they are looking directly at a juicy, fat, pair of piggy banks.\n\nWhen it's all done, the market is probably around 3100-3300 unless things get disorderly. I expect these two to lead us lower, because lets be honest, not much else can. These two have 'been holding the market up higher.\n\nFurther disclaimer: I have positions against AAPL and Tesla. I've been rolling them for a while. I won't share my exits, but here's proof that I am in what I say I am. I started these with 3k. Going strong so far.\n\nGood luck out there. This is not an endorsement for you to copy me. I trade very actively and move very fluidly. Contact a professional if you want real financial advice. I am an amateur and this is my own take on the market. I am not responsible for whatever you choose to do. Be Safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0vivs8sewq91.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb37a10dc058c8ac747a854528aa47c6acd1f2aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yr6m6u8sewq91.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bea9a13fe7fd814cdca1c5f1c1a4f0406c6a9c4\n\nFollow Up Question:\n\nWhy 100$ strike?

Tesla rose even after Elon Musk resurrected his $44 billion bid for Twitter, which rose 22%. In addition to the equity short squeeze, soft economic data gave bulls reason to be optimistic about policy. Job openings in the United States have fallen to a 14-month low, which may coincide with the Federal Reserve's concern about a hot labor market. Bond yields fell in tandem with the dollar.\n\nThe debate over peak hawkishness has heated up following a dovish surprise from Australia's Central Bank and bond purchases by the Bank of England. The concept of a Fed pivot, on the other hand, has been met with skepticism. For one thing, there is a widespread belief that little has fundamentally changed to sway policymakers away from their primary goal of lowering inflation.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\nWhite House Spokeswoman Jean-Pierre: The Biden Administration is not considering new SPR releases.\n\nMusk is said the offer to Twitter to proceed with deal at $54.20. $TSLA $TWTR\n\nFed's Jefferson: Restoring price stability will take time and will likely involve a period of below-trend growth.\n\nMastercard introduces (rhymes to tiptoe) Secure Technology for (rhymes to tiptoe)currency purchases.\n\nOPEC+ considers quota cuts of up to 2 million barrels per day - Delegates.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",

(APO) is backing out of Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) buyout financing for Elon Musk. According to a person familiar with the matter, Apollo Global Management, which was looking to provide $1 billion earlier this year to Elon Musk for the deal, is no longer in talks with the billionaire.\n\nTwitter shares rose more than 22% yesterday after Bloomberg reported that Musk is proposing to acquire the company for the original offer price of $54.20 per share.\n\nLater, it was confirmed that Musk has sent Twitter a letter, according to which he intends to proceed to close the Twitter transaction on the original terms. For the last several months, Musk tried to pull out of the buyout deal due to ongoing disagreement over the number of spam and bot accounts on the site, prompting a lawsuit regarding the takeover.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Musk's changed decision over the deal made Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) investors fear that the billionaire, who sold over $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier in the year to fund the deal, was spreading himself too thin.\n\nAccording to Dan Ives from Wedbush, Musk\u2019s interest in closing the deal would weigh on Tesla\u2019s shares. \"We see lingering impacts from Musk stock sales as a drag dissipating but the big worry is Musk juggling too many balls at the same time,\" Ives said.\n\nBy Davit Kirakosyan",

It\u2019s currently down -40k USD (lmfao this fucking robot).\n\nI\u2019m thinking about selling my TSLA calls to offset the cap gains tax I\u2019ll have to pay on the 80K. I don\u2019t think this contract will print. If I wait to sell and it\u2019s a loss next year, I don\u2019t have any guaranteed cap gains I can use to subtract it from.\n\nCurious if anyone has any thoughts about this. Part of me wants to yolo for the TSLA calls and another part wants to offset the cap gains tax. I can always reposition in TSLA with the remaining contract value once liquidated.\n\nSincerely, Regard.",

    "title": "Non-Boomer Portfolio Management for The Highly Regarded",
    "selftext": "Boomer portfolios are some kind of X/Y percentage split between index stock funds and bond funds. No thanks, not interested.\n\nHowever, while boring, the concepts of portfolio management can be applied to WSB-style portfolios to help smooth out returns. Here's some examples:\n\nI like gold miners. GDX and GDXJ along with some individual holdings. I am bullish on them because I am bullish on gold due to fiat money collapse and central bank recklessness. There's a problem with gold miners. They use energy to dig up the gold. That's an input cost.\n\nI am also bullish on energy. I think we're going into a commodities supercycle because ESG has threatened energy security. There's lack of development in the energy sector outside of solar/green/wind, and there are shortages.\n\nCombining gold miners with energy plays in my portfolio reduces risk. Because not only am I diversifying across sectors, but the energy sector is an input into the gold mining sector. So if energy costs rise and put downward pressure on gold mining profits, then my energy stocks rise to compensate.\n\nI'm also bullish on tankers. The longer the Russia-Ukraine thing goes on, the longer that \"woke\" countries have to pretend they aren't buying Russian oil by having Russia send the oil to China and then China send them on tankers to Putin-Man-Bad countries.\n\nI currently have $50k worth of Russian equities that are frozen due to 'Merica and freedom and stuff. The longer the Ukraine thing goes on, the longer they will be frozen and the greater chance I'll be forced to sell my Russian stocks back to Russian Oligarchs for pennies on the dollar to teach them a lesson about democracy or whatever. Thus, being long tanker stocks hedges this, because tanker stocks benefit from a prolonged Ukraine crisis.\n\nI was bullish on Defense Contractors back in November 2021. I knew we'd be entering an economic crisis and those historically result in war. So I loaded up on some contractors, and then in February, when the Ukraine thing popped off, I sold. I'd like to buy back in, but I think they're overpriced now. And if we do have a war, my gold holdings should do great, so I don't need defense contractors to hedge for WW3. Gold is a cheaper hedge at the moment, being down 20% over the last year, compared to defense contractors which are up 20% over the last year.\n\nI am bearish on Tesla. Always have been. I'm also bearish on the SP500 as a whole. I think TSLA will go down more than the SP500, because in a recession, people won't be buying luxury cars. So I pair TSLA Puts / Shorts in my portfolio. If there's a recession, the need for energy goes down, so my energy stocks go down, but TSLA shorts go up.\n\nIf the government cancels the recession by printing a few trillion more dollars, my gold miners should do great in spite of the TSLA shorts getting crushed.\n\nI'm not saying you should also be bearish on TSLA. Let's say you're bullish. Great. Find something that will go up, in the event you're incorrect. If TSLA crashes, what will go up in that environment? I'm not trying to tell you what sectors to pick, just that you should find other sectors that will perform well if your bullish case goes wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** Construct your portfolio in such a way that regardless of what happens, something compensates and does better to make up for the losses in the other thing. Don't buy 10% positions of 10 different High Growth Tech Stocks because when things crash, all 10 of them go down together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Holdings:**\n\nGDX / GDXJ Gold Miners\n\nVarious Energy Oil, LNG, Uranium, Coal\n\nTankers FRO is my favorite\n\nTSLA Puts 3 to 6 months out, 30% to 70% OTM",

    "selftext": "According to \"The Ponzi Factor,\" [https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/](https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/), companies like Google, Tesla and Berkshire-Hathaway are ponzi schemes. Why? Because none of them  provide dividends to their shareholders and \"therefore,\" can only supply value to their investors by receiving an influx of investments from new investors, which is the definition of a ponzi scheme (see [https://www.sec.gov/files/ia\\_virtualcurrencies.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_virtualcurrencies.pdf) and [https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml)).\n\nThis (if the reasoning is to be believed) means that Berkshire-Hathaway has been running a ponzi scheme for the past 183 years. But companies like Google and Tesla do provide value to their investors because they provide value to their customers: they actually do something useful, unlike, say, Bernie Madoff. Likewise, Berkshire-Hathaway provides value to its investors by investing in companies which provide great value to their customers. So The Ponzi Factor's claim doesn't make sense since they (TSLA, et al) don't need new investments to provide value to their customers; they provide value inherently. In fact that's precisely why they attract new investors: they provide great value in the future to those investors who were willing to invest in them in the past. Otherwise BRK wouldn't still be attracting new investors 183 years after its inception.\n\nDoes anyone think that The Ponzi Factor's claims make any sense? If so, please explain how.",

Anyone holding TSLA beware - its not going to \"fair value\" its going to overshoot to the downside \n* Housing and rent basically can't go down (sorry to all the housing crash enthusiasts) with supply constrained. No one wants to be building, no new housings coming on the market, existing owners (should) have 3% interest rates and can't/won't sell. Everyone has to rent or bid up assets further. A decade of under building precedes this market environment. There can't be \"demand destruction\" if there is a greater number of \"sellers destroyed\" by even greater market dynamics than rates \n* Russia running out of options. Even if peace/deal is reached globalization is over and the west hasn't quite realized that\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to win:** \n\nSell call spreads until we test the low, then sell put spreads why SPY is around 348-350 level.

    "selftext": "Both NKLA and TSLA have beautiful features however NKLA has 2 major options that empower the operators for longer range without having to stop for charging:\n\n1- Electric option \n2- Clean energy source for alternative solutions \nTo be perfectly unbiased NKLA maybe facing temporary challenges vs TSLA\u2019s broader followers base due to Elon\u2019s major presence and influence on Twitter because twitter is like the world town hall, which he can attract more attention to Tesla products. So do never underestimate his power, in the other side of the fence NKLA\u2019s truck products are just in its infancy phase. I personally respect their resilience with competing with a giant like Tesla. It\u2019s like having a 17 year kid fighting a well seasoned knight without horse, spear and protection. I love NKLA products for 2 additional environmental reasons:\n1- More clean fuel source options and range \n2- Potentially contributing in environmental protection \n\nI love Tesla\u2019s products too but as someone with wealth growth mindset with as little money as possible I don\u2019t like TSLA stock as it\u2019s highly expensive and mature (Tesla stock), I personally content to have built 7000 shares in NKLA in my portfolio as I believe the today\u2019s $3-$10 range per NKLA stock is a great wealth building opportunity for me. However, I also understand that to reach my financial goals of wealth building this requires me to hold it for longer period of time, be strategically patient with it and just go with NKLA\u2019s flow to travel it\u2019s natural growth path. \n\nThere is a famous saying:\nRoom wasn\u2019t built in a day. Tesla didn\u2019t reach to what it\u2019s today either. I remember when Elon was talking about Tesla potential people were mocking him and his product but people that believed in him stayed the course till today. I also believe that it takes time, patience of a monk to watch NKLA gradually reach to $5,  $10, $20, $25, $40, and beyond.\n\nI am not suggesting this to anyone here, I understand the risk of holding this, I am \ud83d\udcaf committed to my core beliefs of NKLA values, therefore I am done building my 7,000 shares of NKLA. I just let it do it\u2019s thing. \n\nI hope you all ladies and gentlemen have a blessed and full of happiness weekend.",

    "selftext": "Obviously in this unpredictable market it's possible that TSLA could recover and reach new all time highs, but for the sake of this discussion, assuming the market continues to tumble over the next 6 months, how low do you think TSLA will go?\n\n(These are post stock split numbers)\n\nFor reference, TSLA is currently at 200 a share, down 50% from its ath of 400. So it could seem like a good deal at the moment. However when you look at it's 5 year chart (which a surprising amount of autists here never have), you see that it was at only 30 a share in January 2020 right before the covid madness. So it seems reasonable to assume it could still fall significantly more.\n\nThe thing with TSLA stock is people aren't just investing in a car company, they're investing in all of Elons other ventures. Selfishly, I'd like to see TSLA fall to around 100 a share and if it does I'll load up on stock and continue to do so. I absolutely could see TSLA reaching 1000 a share again in the future.\n\nThoughts?",

A less than impressive gain since my last update (was up about \\~$12000 realized and unrealized) but whatever the hell it was that happened on CPI day did a number on me. Since many people appear to be having issues with images on Reddit lately, in addition to the above, here's the current positions written out.\n\nI've significantly rebalanced my positions, the account I was using for holding shares has since been switched over to income generating energy plays on oil, natural gas, and uranium. I've also dumped a lot of my index shorts to open a little under $8000 in Apple and Amazon puts.\n\nThe food shortage plays aren't looking great, the harvest came in worse than expected this fall, but I may have gotten the timing for the pricing in of that bad harvest wrong. Will probably look to roll out and add to the agricultural positions to next spring/summer.  Ag ETF positions omitted from picture because AutoMod didn't like them.\n\n**C0RN - 27.60 (last update 26.91)**\n\n10 2/17/23 31c\n\n**W3AT - 8.75 (last update 8.82)**\n\n10 1/20/23 17c\n\n20 1/20/23 18c\n\n**S0YB - 26.46 (last update 26.88)**\n\n10 11/18 29c\n\n10 2/17/23 29c\n\n**SPXS - 28.87 (last update 27.14)**\n\n8 11/4 30c\n\n**SPXU - 21.92**\n\n*11 12/16 21c*\n\n**SPY - 357.63 (last update 367.95)**\n\n4 11/18 330p\n\n*7 12/16 300p*\n\n4 3/17/23 255p\n\n4 1/19/24 210p\n\n**AAPL - 138.83**\n\n*100 12/16 80p*\n\n*100 12/16 70p*\n\n*50 6/16 60p*\n\n**AMZN - 106.90**\n\n*50 12/16 65p*\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6n41t/just_sold_my_house_heres_the_market_crash_and/) to the post laying out my general thesis on this play. And since this somehow became a thing in the comments of that post - yeah, that's not a straight screenshot of any of my brokerage accounts, I put the images from Schwab, Fidelity, and ETrade together into one picture on MS Paint because I've got no interest in sharing my full accounts or account numbers with the internet.\n\nI'm not a fan of diamond handing options, blew up my account once like that, now I take profits. The *italicized* positions are new since last update, and were bought with profits from closing stuff.\n\nI added the Apple and Amazon shorts because they're the two shittiest, most overpriced companies in the market, along with Tesla (tessie is going to die hard and fast once the HF's and institutions that are long on it start blowing up). Apple's consumer graph looks incredibly similar to Nike's, and well, look what happened after their last ER. Amazon is currently a great company (AWS) tied to a shitberg of money losing (everything else AMZN does). Jassy was a horrifically bad choice to head up Amazon as a whole because he doesn't understand what their marketplace's competitive advantage actually is or how it's being destroyed. Price target on AAPL = 45ish, on AMZN 25ish. Their PE's are 23 and 96 respectively.  Both AAPL and AMZN also currently have Unionizing issues that are just going to keep increasing.  Sooner or later TSLA will get unionized as well, at least at the factories.\n\nI'd like to have more Amazon and any Tesla short positions, but right now I can't find a good entry on them, so I'll keep waiting until I do.\n\nMy optimistic case for global harvests is now -20%. Every international analysis I've looked at points to excess production from countries that don't have it to make up the shortfall. Supposedly the US is/has prepared a brief on just how bad it is, and that is not available to the public. I am no longer sure this will be priced in before my current options expire. Looking at potentially rolling my current ones out about 6 months, will add to them if I do.\n\nAs per one of my [previous DD's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/), we're now seeing increased migration and violence around the world, with a second competing currency bloc forming primarily around Russia and China. There are some other countries that get lumped in with that, but I'm doubtful they all stick, given the tensions between many of them.\n\nI'll take a second to recommend [u/Peruvian\\_Bull](https://www.reddit.com/u/Peruvian_Bull/) 's DD posts on the collapse of the dollar as global reserve currency, there has been absolute chaos and carnage in the Forex markets lately and his stuff from over a year ago is pretty much playing out perfectly.\n\nChina's economy is basically a zombie being propped up by threats of violence to banking and real estate executives and local government officials. Once the China National Party Congress meeting ends (runs from 10/16 though 10/22) the wheels probably come off in a very, very bad way.\n\nTehran continues to have increasing protests after the Basij (religious police, everyone hates them) murdered a 22 year old woman for not wearing a hijab. Food prices are now higher than they were during the Arab Spring. These protests aren't as big of a deal as some in the west want to pretend, but they're a bigger deal and have more popular support than you'd think from the press coverage (lack) on them. Food prices and inflation are high enough this could easily take a wild turn very unexpectedly and very fast in Iran/KSA/Iraq/Syria/Egypt. All of these countries have large populations of young men and the temperature will get very hot in them in a couple of months. (the basic formula for societal unrest is lots of young men + poor job/future prospects + hot weather + high prices = violence)\n\nRussia continues to experience issues with it's plan to draft people, and continues losing in Ukraine. Western leaders appear to be pulling a repeat of the Treaty of Versailles mistakes of just thinking they can grind a country down indefinitely instead of giving them a way out.  The Ukrainian provinces currently being fought over were in open rebellion/civil war for years before Russia invaded, and would make some nice \"buffer states\" in any peace deal.  Russia's conventional army is basically gone at this point, going forwards they'll be fighting asymmetrically with cyber attacks and hits on infrastructure leading to spikes in energy prices or big drops in markets.\n\nIndia has halted Rice exports, after shutting down Wheat exports earlier this summer. California's Rice crop is, to put it mildly, toast. The poorest people eat rice - this one is going to get bad going forward.",

    "selftext": "I am going to be using the SP Futures chart because the real points of resistance are coming from the SP index, and not SPY. Yes, the same general areas for support/resistance apply, but they will not line up with nice round numbers on SPY but they will on the SP500 Futures. \n\n**Big Picture**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9vxhzzu2eu91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6b06f62a4ac7b25aa1a63146149089dfa958cc\n\n**A few lines on a chart for you:**\n\n* 3250-3500 area of previous resistance. This was a battle ground after Covid and we are close to entering this zone again. \n* 3400 pre-covid high\n* 3600 the current price we are fighting over\n\n**Where are we going?** \n\n* Down: The bear market channel (tan lines) and the **3500** level line up pretty well and are within striking distance in the near term. That is my downside target. \n* Up: **3800** is the next area of resistance to the upside. Keep in mind volatility is still high, sentiment is still very bearish, RSI is on the lower end, and we are in the lower end of the channel. This is a setup for another bounce (remember last week?)\n   * We already got a meaningful bounce this AM and it might last for several days or even weeks\n\n**Don't press on shorts:**\n\n* This is likely not the place to press on shorts or buy more puts. That time was last week when SPY moved up and vix moved down.\n* Expect more shorts and put holders to close their positions as they get blown out by extreme moves to the upside and VIX coming down. \n* If you want to be short, *sell call spreads.* Yes, we likely will go lower but you are better off selling calls here than buying puts. \n\nExpect a bounce around 3500 and sell put spreads when we get there.\n\n**Why we would go lower**\n\n* Interest rates are going higher, yields higher, BOE is done interfering, Russia is moving nukes around and Europe is preparing, bank earnings and provide negative guidance \n* TSLA earnings and guidance shock the market to the downside \n* With today's early AM bounce, the RSI has come off the bottom and the \"pressure\" to the downside being removed, we are more likely to run out of buyers, run out of shorts needing to close and run out of hopium \n\n**Why would we go higher**\n\n* Russia will reach some level of cease fire. Today they stopped the \"draft\" it seems \n* China will reopen \n* Midterms are coming\n* Gas prices will be coming down most likely \n* Some level of uncertainty has been removed after last weeks economic reports. the market \"knows\" what the FED is going to do and less uncertainty = bullish\n* Sentiment is/was at historic lows - setting us up for a bounce \n* TSLA earnings surprise to the upside and this lifts the whole market   \n\n\n**Short Term Picture**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54dm14y03eu91.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698a9d80055a124df7c2cf5ac3d9ab43e30ff0da\n\n* Notice in this picture we are about midway of the bearish channel (tan lines). This is no mans land.\n* 3800 is a meaningful area to the upside, 3500 is meaningful area to the downside \n\n**How to Trade It:**\n\n* Do not add buy puts here, do not go short, wait until VIX is 28 or lower, or we hit 3800. \n* Sell calls if you are bearish, but give yourself two weeks minimum and keep your sold strike at 3700 or greater (370 on SPY). \n   * **Sell -370/+380 early November call spreads on SPY. Try to collect $350&gt; in credit.** \n* Close puts, close shorts, close any bearish positions when we get to 3500. My recommendation would be to *sell put spreads* at 3500 when we reach it because VIX will be elevated \n   * **On the next big down day, or when we get closer to 3500 on SP500, sell -345/+335 early November put spreads on SPY.** You could enter a limit order today for about $350 in credit and wait for them to fill \n\nWith both those positions filled you will have picked up $700 in credit betting that SPY is between 370 and 335 in early November. Max gain $700, max loss $300.",

    "selftext": "TL,DR: puts into earnings and calls after, buybacks prop up price and allow Elon to sell less stock for more money (all before the 28th) if it doesn\u2019t go as I think, I will lick your toes \ud83d\udc45 \ud83e\uddb6 \n\nLet me preface this all with a little bit of background\u2026 \nThere once was a special child named Elon Tusk and this special crayon eating minion dreamed of going to space \ud83d\ude80 and having alien babies. As he grew older, he realized that the big fancy rockets weren\u2019t cheap so he decided to get absolutely MINTED \ud83e\udd11. He did this by processing payments via the inter webs. One day, I big fancy company bought his little shop for like a gajillion doll hairs and he bought an expensive car that looked like a spaceship, but didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t one until he saw it in person \ud83d\ude43\n\nStill with me? \n\nGreat, so our fren, Elon Tusk was having a midlife crises and liked his spaceship car so much, he decided to make his own. He realized that the closes spaceship car he could build was an electric car, because of the sound. He scaled this cool sounding spaceship car into a very large public company with the help of the United States government and fanboys like myself. Then, one day he look out at the sky while cruising the PCH and noticed, his spaceship couldn\u2019t fly. This angered our fren, Elon Tusk because he was yet again, tethered to the ground. \n\nEnter SpaceseX, we all know this story. Couple rockets go boom, and a couple flew. Elon even sent his spaceship car into space in hopes that maybe, just maybe an alien would slingshot that shit back to him as a sign of peace (and foreplay). \n\nElon Tusk was sitting on his launchpad one day and a little birdie landed right on the top of his nose and said \u201cbuy twitter, you fucking spaz\u201d\n\n\nThat brings us to today,\n\nElon has so much money (like a FUCK TON), BUTT not nearly enough to buy twitter in CASH MONIES, unless\u2026 investors and banks lend him some CASH MONIES, they all make an agreement that he will buy twitter for like a gajillion dollhairs\u2026 \n\nProblem is, Elon really likes rockets and aliens, so he entirely forgot that he agreed to buy a little birdie company\u2026 the birdie company gets all hot and bothered because they had this opportunity to get ABSOLUTELY MINTED and Elon Tusk just forgot about them :(\n\nSo, they go to court, all the dirty panties get aired out on the same birdie company website that Elon Tusk is contractually obligated to buy\u2026 then, one day, the birdie and the absolute fox of a judge decide to give papa Elon Tusk another shot\u2026 \n\nBuddy has a shitload of money committed and signed for to fund the deal, problem is that nobody wants to lend money to anybody (even billionaires) unless they got sum skin in the game. \n\nNow, why doesn\u2019t he just sell all his Tesla stock and buy twitter outright? \nWell, it was kinda a joke to start out and then he basically got high as giraffe pussy one day and was like \u201cfuck it\u201d\u2026 or something like that (I assume). But now\u2026 he is contractually a obligated to. And if he were to sell all his stock, he would effectively tank his money tree and not be able to build rockets and have baby aliens :(\n\nSo\u2026 he settled on some loans and I believe some partners to buy twitter, problem is he still needs to sell a couple billi in space car stock in order for the deal to go through. \n\n\ud83d\udea8 So, here\u2019s where the actual DD cums into play.\n\n\nFACTS TO CONSIDER \ud83e\udde0 \n\n\ud83d\udc49His blackout period ends the 18th of October (he will most likely be liquidating some fat stacks worth of stock)\n\n\ud83d\udc49He contractually has to buy twitter by the 28th or he gets fukked by the system (and a little birdie)\n\n\ud83d\udc49Many investors have been trying to get papa Elon to buyback stock in order to boost the share price and protect the company against short sellers\n\n\ud83d\udc49Earnings are on the 19th \n\n\nAll these yellow fingers considered, leads us to a reasonably logical outcome.\n\nTesla buys back shares at a discounted price (because everybody is expecting him to sell his shares) effectively inflating Tesla shares (also, allowing him to sell less shares and still get his Billi\u2019s to buy the birdie). Papa Elon buys the birdie and we all live happily for the day.\n\nSo\u2026What\u2019s the play? \n\n\n\ud83d\udca8POOTS on Tesla\u2026 yep, puts going into earnings. \n\n\ud83e\udd11SELL poots  before earnings \n\n\ud83d\udcb5 CALLS before earnings (12dte)\n\n\ud83e\udd11SELL calls when he announces buybacks \n\n\ud83d\udca8POOTS (longer dated ) when he announces buybacks (cheaper)\n\n\ud83e\udd11SELL poots  when he starts selling\n\n\nTeslas earnings are expected to miss so the voodo forces at play might actually rocket Tesla  to the moon if there is any announcement this week ( buybacks) \n\nIf none of the above happen, I\u2019m sorry and I will hold up the end of my deal and lick your toes \ud83e\uddb6\n\nIsn\u2019t all this ILLEGAL?!!! \n\nShould be\u2026 there\u2019s definitely a case to be made.\nHowever, from what I found, it isn\u2019t. (Buybacks are definitely frowned upon and a lot of people think they should be illegal) but that\u2019s another story.\nLet\u2019s say if papa Elon doesn\u2019t sell, but announces buybacks, shares go up.\nNow, let\u2019s say, he doesn\u2019t announce buybacks, shares go down.\nLet\u2019s say he doesn\u2019t buy twitter and doesn\u2019t buyback or sell, stock goes down. \n\n\nBoring garbage:\n\nTesla Earnings expectations: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/earnings\n\nElon lockup period ends: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/tesla-investors-beware-musk-has-narrow-window-to-offload-more-shares-to-generate-cash-for-twitter-takeover/ar-AA12I0mW\n\n3rd largest shareholder wants buybacks: https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/elon-musk-raises-hopes-for-a-tesla-stock-buyback-with-a-one-word-tweet-to-3rd-biggest-shareholder/ar-AA12Y7qj#image=AA12XSfm%7C2\n\nPrevious buyback proposal: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/19/tesla-investor-calls-for-stock-buyback-after-share-price-falls.html\n\nElon needs cash to buy twitter : https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/to-buy-twitter-elon-musk-has-to-keep-banks-investors-on-board/3898969/\n\nElon has no cash: https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2019/12/04/why-elon-musk-is-cash-poor-for-a-billionaire/?sh=75eda36c33f6",

    "selftext": "Well there it is guys, the end of the great bull run of October 14th.\n\nFirst let's do Tesla.\n\n**Tesla needed to be perfect, it wasn't:**\n\n* Missed on deliveries, logistics problems, revenue miss, EPS barely beat.\n* Let's not forget this stock has a 80PE and a valuation based on never ending growth, 0% interest rates, and meme stock buying. Rates are at 5%, consumers ran out of disposable income/savings, Tesla lost the \"wow\" factor, all other competitors are in the space now.\n* I told you to sell calls: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla\\_time\\_to\\_sell\\_calls/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n* I told you tesla growth story was dying: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla\\_is\\_dying/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nIf you bought calls, enough the down move, but look to be adding puts at the 200 price level. I recommend selling the -190/+180 put spread to balance out the sold calls. If you are bullish in Tesla (why tho?) then just sell those puts because IV is going to be crazy in the AM if we gap down hard as expected .\n\n**Which Week is Best to Trade on Tesla?**\n\nHere is a custom chart I made for you. Let's review the implied volatility in Tesla over the next 10 weeks. As you can hopefully see in this chart, IV for calls is higher than puts! It is all you dumbasses bidding up the calls. I highly encourage anyone holding calls to sell, and if you are not long calls, then start shorting them. **4 weeks out** has great liquidity, high volume, tight spreads. That is where you want to be.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n[Tesla vol by week](https://preview.redd.it/mrzea7z5vtu91.png?width=1899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83ee6d62233567ff7059fe42ef06cf49fb2cfb2b)\n\nVolatility and Volume x Week\n\n**Which Strike is Best to Trade on Tesla?**\n\nHere is another custom chart I made for you guys. The \"lighter\" colored lines represent Black Scholes and what the options \"should\" be priced at. The solid color lines are the real prices.\n\nIn looking at this chart you can see that, because of our collective stupidity, IV for calls is higher than puts (people are dumb and buying calls). Conclusion, sell calls!When we look at the strikes we can see there is a lot of volume and liquidity at the nice round numbers like 190,200,210, 220.\n\nIf you are selling options, sell those that are overpriced (OTM puts and ITM calls) and buy those that are underpriced (ITM puts and OTM calls)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tesla vol by Strike](https://preview.redd.it/peaelflbvtu91.png?width=1909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec4b7af3c77c2a37e7e2fb065bed9bbce7894daa)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tesla going to 200 this week, breaking through it probably next week.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbqffozevtu91.png?width=1526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2634baa5688da4587bdebc6eba04e3a089fdac2c\n\nTesla is starting the long road down\n\n**And now to the overall market.**\n\nTesla earnings just killed all hopes of a sustained rally. Our lord and savior Elon has forsaken the market with the elevated valuation that now has to come back to earth.\n\nWe are going to sell off next few days, at least till Friday, and this is why:\n\n* 10 year rates new high:\n* 2 year rates new high:\n* Dollar nearing highs:\n* Crude on the rise again (nice try Biden)\n\nAnd remember, we just had a meaningless rally after an AWFUL CPI report. The Fed will crush the market further. I explained the recent rally here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\\_spy\\_week\\_of\\_oct\\_17th/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nRecommendations: Sell the -360/370 call spread. Add puts when we hit 348 again on SPY and sell the -340/+330 put spread mid November expiration.",

In comparison, Tesla's market cap is about $690 billion. This means Tesla would have to grow roughly six times its current size to catch up.\n\n\"I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,\" said Musk, according to a transcript of Tesla's earnings call on October 19. He acknowledged it'll be tough, but it can be achieved with \"a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.\"\n\nMusk made the ambitious statement on Wednesday after Tesla reported record revenues of $21.45 billion in the third quarter of 2022 \u2014 although it fell short of the $21.96 billion analysts were estimating, per IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also posted a profit of $3.29 billion in the quarter running from July to September \u2014 just under a record profit of $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of this year.\n\nFull article: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10)\n\nElon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) can exceed the combined value of Apple (AAPL) and Saudi Aramco, which currently with combined market cap of around $4.4 trillion. While TSLA's current market cap is about $690 billion. Do you agree with Elon Musk?",

    "selftext": "Mixed earnings saw Tesla shares retest the June lows after the bell yesterday, and the stock looks like it could be at risk of breaking lower in the coming days. \n\nAlthough $TSLA did quickly recover from last week\u2019s close below the June low, the bounce over the past 3 sessions leading up to earnings has been on diminishing volumes, warning of a potential lack of bullish conviction in this attempted move higher. With broader market seemingly returning to a risk-off mood, if the stock closes even lower this week, sellers may end up targeting a downside breakout from the psychologically key $200 level. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the bounce from right around the June lows in the aftermarket does point to demand remaining around these levels. If $TSLA can continue to hold this support heading into the weekend, it could potentially form a base to rally from when momentum in the broader market swings back in favour of buyers.  \n\nOf course, all trading carries risk, but it will be worth keeping Tesla on the watchlist over the coming days.",

    "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla plans a share buyback program between $5 billion et $10 billion for 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElon Musk took out the carrot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe CEO of Tesla  (TSLA)  tried on October 19 to reassure the electric vehicle maker's shareholders after a completely disastrous first half of October for Tesla shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla shares have lost 16.3% since September 30, which translates into a decline in market value of approximately $135 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe decline is likely to continue, given the group's mixed results in the third quarter and cautious forecast for the whole of 2022. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year. Although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control,\" Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn told analysts during the earnings' call. \"On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year .\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe added: \"This means that again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4. And those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination and Q1 \\[of 2023\\].\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla should therefore produce nearly 1.4 million vehicles in 2022 and deliver over 1.4 million units. It would be a record in both cases, but the firm had hoped to deliver 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'Meaningful Buyback' Tesla posted a third-quarter net profit of $3.3 billion on revenue of $21.45 billion, the company said on October 19. Despite a 56% increase, revenues came below the $21.96 billion anticipated by analysts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFaced with this avalanche of not very reassuring news, Musk pulled out the bazooka. Indeed, the whimsical CEO indicated that Tesla had discussed a massive share buyback program, intended to remunerate the shareholders by boosting the share price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis share buyback program would be between $5 billion and $10 billion, the tech tycoon told analysts during the earnings' call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We debated the buyback idea extensively at board level,\" Musk said. \"The board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. We want to work through the right process to do a buyback. But it is certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 \\[billion\\] to $10 billion even in the downside scenario of next year. Even if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 \\[billion\\] to $10 billion buyback.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe added that it \"is obviously pending board review and approval.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tech tycoon, however, seems optimistic that this will be done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s likely that we will do some meaningful buyback,\u201d he concluded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe announcement also comes a few months after Tesla carried out a stock split. In recent days, investors have been speculating about a buyback on Twitter where Musk is very present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Tesla is having PE ratio compression that can be solved only by buyback and/or by 2x earnings increase,\" a Twitter user suggested on October 3.",

Is China gonna keep selling lithium and rare earths to an American company, or will they try to cripple the US economy and keep everything domestic in response?\n\nChina has lax environmental regulations which is why their mining industry is so big.

Regardless of that demand, Tesla's limiting factor is currently the supply side, and can only get worse.

If we consider the macro, NASDAQ &amp; SPY only down 15% in same period so this is all bullshit.

I really do believe, everyone is \"playing along\" to bring the price down JUST to buy in cheaper because they missed the boat in 2020, all while everyone else still has plausible deniability that this *might not be* a generational company, so AS SOON AS Twitter pressure lefts next friday, this thing will explode to the upside.\n\n... I admit this thought process may be completely regarded. If Elon starts selling next week I will have to come to terms with the fact that my position will say something crazy like -50% and I will not sleep easy next week.

    "selftext": "Tesla Inc (NSDQ: TSLA) was incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. It designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, as well as energy generation and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company as of 21 October 2022 is valued at $649.51bn, although shares have fallen from $400 to $215 since the start of the year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir Q3 for the year was released on 19 October 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRevenue was up 56% to $21,454m (compared to last year), while net profit was up 103.5% to $3,292m. This means its net margin improved from 11.8% to 15.3%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe short-term liquidity (current liabilities/current assets) of Tesla is high, at a current rate of 68.4%, despite improving from 72.2% this time last year. Investors will want to see this rate drop below 50% as soon as possible and show a tighter control of liabilities. Rising interest rates will not coincide well for company's with high liabilities, although rising net profit margins may provide optimism that its liquidity will continue improving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent assets increased 44% to $35,990m, while current liabilities increased 36.3% to $24,611m. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla's long-term liquidity (total liabilities/total assets) is at a much healthier rate than its short-term liquidity, having dipped to 46.5% in the Q3. This shows that the company is in a tighter financial position in the short-term period (one year), than its long-term.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTotal assets increased 28.7% to $74,426m since last year, while total liabilities were up at a slower rate of 12.3% to $34,575m. Long-term liquidity has improved from 53.2% to 46.5% during that timeframe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTotal cash levels have also been steadily increasing since last year, which is impressive when liquidity is simultaneously decreasing, which again may be thanks to rising net profit margins. Total cash increased 31.1% to $21,107m, which made up 61.1% of the company's total liabilities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made some charts so the information is easier to absorb.

    "selftext": " \n\n[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) shares slipped in premarket trade Monday after the company cut the price of some of its cars in China.\n\nShares of the electric car maker were down around 3% in New York before the market open.\n\nTesla slashed the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China, one of the company's most critical markets.\n\nThe starting price for the\u00a0Model\u00a03 sedan was reduced to 265,900 Chinese yuan ($36,615) from 279,900 yuan. The Model Y sports utility vehicle now costs 288,900 yuan versus the previous price of 316,900 yuan.\n\nTesla's cuts partly reverse some of the price increases the company was [forced to carry out earlier this year in China and the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/15/tesla-hikes-car-prices-in-the-us-china-after-musk-inflation-warning.html) on the back of rising raw material costs.\n\n \n\n[Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), CEO of Tesla, [warned in March](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/17/tesla-hikes-china-made-model-y-price-again-by-more-than-2000.html) that his electric car company is \"seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials &amp; logistics.\"\n\nThe price cuts also come after Musk said he sees elements of a recession in China.\n\n\"China is experiencing a recession of sorts\" mostly in the property markets, Musk said last week.\n\nTesla\u00a0[delivered](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2022-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html) 343,000 vehicles for the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analyst expectations.

Tesla has a huge Gigafactory in the Chinese city of Shanghai which it completed upgrades on earlier this year.\n\nStill, the price cuts come in the [face of rising competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/byd-shares-jump-after-chinese-ev-maker-forecasts-surging-profits.html) for Tesla in China from domestic firms such as Warren Buffett-backed [BYD](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1211-HK/) as well as upstarts [Nio](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NIO/) and [Xpeng](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XPEV/).\n\nOther electric car makers have [hiked prices this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/electric-carmakers-in-china-hike-prices-on-rising-material-costs-.html) including BYD and Xpeng, as rising raw material costs hit these companies.\n\nThe Chinese economy keeps facing challenges particularly as strict [Covid-19](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) controls continue to weigh on retail sales.

Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.\n\n \n\nEarnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.\n\nFor this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.\n\nEarnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn\u2019t leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla\u2019s revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nOn Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.\n\nStrength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback\u2019s 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.\n\nThat headwind is expected to show up in Amazon\u2019s results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate\u2019s revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that \u201cforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs\" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.\n\n  \n\nFor Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted \u201cdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.\u201d\n\nMeta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech\u2019s 72-hour earnings rollout.\n\nOther notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.\n\nIn economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings \u2013 which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER\u2019s panel of economists must officially declare a recession.\n\nEconomic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.\n\n \n\nAccording to Pantheon Economics\u2019 Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.\n\n\u201cBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,\u201d Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",

    "selftext": " Morgan Stanley cut its base case price target on Overweight-rated Tesla (TSLA) to $330 from $350 to allow for a greater margin of safety in terms of supply chain and incremental pressures from FX headwinds, input cost inflation, startup costs. The firm also pointed to the risk of profitability in China if political tension heats up and warned Tesla could see some demand destruction if the global economy worsens.\n\n\"While initial signs of a slowing consumer present itself in shrinking order-to-delivery times/reduced order backlots, we believe Tesla\u2019s increasingly large size today and in the forecast makes it susceptible to what could be some profound swings in consumer strength and EV affordability,\" updated analyst Adam Jonas. Morgan Stanley kept its long-term TSLA unit volume forecast of 3.2M units by 2025 and 7.7M by 2030 in place for now.\n\nMorgan Stanley pulled in its automotive gross margin and cash flow for Tesla (TSLA) to account some of the headwinds, including ramping two Gigafactories on separate continents.\n\nOn capital allocation, Jonas said the firm is not enthusiastic about share buybacks from TSLA given the other growth opportunities the electric vehicle maker has at its disposal and the importance of building up cash reserves to maintain a self-financing status throughout a range of uncertain economic environments.\n\nPutting the Morgan Stanley caution in perspective, the new PT of $330 still reps more than 60% upside for TSLA from its current level. Morgan Stanley also has a bull case PT of $500 on the EV stock and bear case price target of $150.\n\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) were down 1.98% at 3:05 p.m. on a rough day overall for U.S. companies with exposure in China.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/morgan-stanley-cuts-tesla-price-target-warns-of-unexpected-headwinds-ahead.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/morgan-stanley-cuts-tesla-price-target-warns-of-unexpected-headwinds-ahead.html)\n\nMorgan Stanley has cut its Tesla (TSLA) price target to $330 from $350, warning of \u2018unexpected headwinds\u2019 ahead due to spending slowdown. Do you think TSLA could really rally 36% to $330?",

    "title": "Elon Will Get Cancelled Soon",
    "selftext": "**Positives**: Let's keep it real, Elon deserves a lot of credit for all of his accomplishments, positivity brought into the world, a vision for a future and trying to turn humanity into a multi-planetary species. \n\n**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. \n\n**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. \n\n**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. \n\n**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very \"non left\" thing to do. \n\n**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. \n\n**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. \n\n**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. \n\n**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate \u201cbig tech\u201d - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. \n\n**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. \n\n**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. \n\n**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  \n\n**\\[Redacted\\]:** His is king of \"that which can't be named here\" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.\n\n**Not Green Enough:** The \"green\" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly \"green\" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being \"more green\" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. \n\n**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have \"founder control\" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. \n\n**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? \n\n**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the \"town square\" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the \"real\" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  \n\nI had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. \n\nI have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of \"person\" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. \n\nWhat do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially \"cancelled\" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months? Is his popularity and influence fading along with his market cap? Can Elon be cancelled?",

    "selftext": "So usually I\u2019m a \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b on put options for spy. What I have learned the last two weeks doing options on stocks that have earnings coming out. So last week I was up 4k on TSLA calls right before earnings held into after hours and lost a total of 18k. Had I sold before market closed I would have been up 4k. Then again this week had Intel puts for 24 and was up 3k going into earnings. Tomorrow I\u2019ll lose majority of it unless something happens but my advice to anyone new playing options on earnings is to sell before market closes if the earnings report is after hours. You\u2019ll make money regardless provided you bought a couple days before the earnings call leading up to the day before earnings. I made most of my losses on TSLA back from meta puts and yea I\u2019ll lose my initial 1k in puts on Intel but will makeup for it on my other plays in GILD, Xom, and spy. Just wanted to share what I\u2019ve learned to help others make better decisions on plays.",

Let me know in the comments.\n\nThis week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.\n\nThe following is basically my plan for next week.\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 10/31**\n\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI\n\n10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct\n\n**Tuesday 11/01**\n\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct\n\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct\n\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep\n\n**Wednesday 11/02**\n\n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct\n\n2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision\n\n2:30 PM Fed Press Conference\n\n**Thursday 11/03**\n\n8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep\n\n10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct\n\n**Friday 11/04**\n\n8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct\n\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct\n\nSo all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.\n\nSo my play here is in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 - The Rate Hike\n\nBelieve it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77\n\nAs of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing\n\n0% chance of 100Bps\n\n81.3% chance of 75Bps\n\n18.7% chance of 50Bps\n\nNow in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.\n\nIn all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.\n\nPart 2 - The Meeting\n\nWell this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.\n\nIf they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.\n\nThis part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.\n\nAnyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.\n\nThe fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)\n\nOn the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies \u2018\u2019missed\u2019\u2019 (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.\n\nAs you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.\n\nGuys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.\n\nBut like i said we shall see.\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Tue 1 Nov\n\n**After Close - Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD)**\n\n* Technology/Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.57 &amp; Revenue $6.7B\n* Options pricing in a 12.1% move on earnings\n* My Play: Been in this one for a while, since it reported Revenues and dropped hard but i keep selling because it keeps running.

    "selftext": "Hey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\\_spy\\_next\\_9\\_days/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\\_spy\\_week\\_of\\_oct\\_17th/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \n\nLets review the chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08\n\nA few points to note, the \"**oversold we are too bearish\" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. \n\nEquities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.\n\nWhat did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. \n\nWhat about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. \n\nIs the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. \n\nWhat about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. \n\nWill POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be \"the man\" to solve this problem. \n\n**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. \n\nDid Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** \n\nDid the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. \n\nIs the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. \n\nWhy did we rally? **Historic put buying was \"closed\" and historic \"bearishness\" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** \n\n**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. \n\nFor some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** \n\nCounter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   \n\n\n**How to Trade It:**  \n\n\n* With the VIX \"relatively low\" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. \n* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. \n* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.\n* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. \n* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. \n* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a \"free\" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. \n\nWhat other macro trends do you think I missed? \n\nPS. if you don't want to short the market, short TSLA. Its the most obvious play out there.

    "title": "ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I)",
    "selftext": "# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade\n\nIf you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to \u201cbe right,\u201d \u2014 you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.\n\nThe challenge obviously is that it\u2019s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we\u2019ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said \u201cbe something when others are something\u201d? Yes, and today is your opportunity.\n\nRight now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential \u201cmillionaire maker\u201d name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.\n\nI am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.\n\n# 2/ The Background and the Backers\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.\n\nASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite \u201ccell towers\u201d in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn\u2019t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.\n\nAll sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.\n\nRight now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start \u201cunfurling\u201d on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.\n\n[BlueWalker 3 satellite and the ASTS team](https://preview.redd.it/33cpnveensx91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7059c581f68dd7f8adb8bb5663bea60f99ba61e1)\n\nThe TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.\n\nThe guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.\n\n[Abel Avellan, ASTS CEO](https://preview.redd.it/2x5ig8d6qsx91.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c58394f173020322517f0df528d7dc472ae80aa)\n\nOther direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.\n\n[ From proxy statement in August 2022 ](https://preview.redd.it/69x5j87jnsx91.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ada6869ad8bffee0ca8c6081504def653799730)\n\nFrom OpenInsider: insider transactions on ASTS since de-SPAC, all purchases, no selling even when shares unlocked and ASTS spiked 100%+.\n\n[Data on insider transactions](https://preview.redd.it/kma0es8nnsx91.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b24cf9431542b0a121c7d6c11bd4fea9742405a)\n\nThe BELIEVERS:\n\n* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.\n* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.\n* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.\n* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.\n* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.\n* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.\n* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.\n\nThe NON-BELIEVERS:\n\n* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you\u2019re interested in reading a negative scenario case.\n\n[ Kerrisdale Capital claims ASTS is unconnected from reality](https://preview.redd.it/497r7h9unsx91.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc8eff8ed2a8082c8aa693edbb21d6f56ef2b57)\n\n# 3/ The Astrology and the Price\n\nAs a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.\n\nThe market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It\u2019s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I\u2019d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% \u2013 we\u2019d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it\u2019s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman\u2019s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.\n\nDeutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:\n\n[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)\n\nInterestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.\n\nASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock \u201cwinners\u201d they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.\n\n[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)\n\nASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength \u2014 compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.\n\nPretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% \u2014 during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.\n\nNow we are back at the \u201csupport\u201d or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.\n\n# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts\n\nThe no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the \u201ceasy\u201d trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.\n\nThis year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.\n\n1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just \u201criding with tide\u201d as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the \u201ceasy\u201d bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.\n2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.\n\nAfter Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 \u201csupport area\u201d and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.\n\nI think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.\n\n# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts\n\nWe have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.\n\n1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.\n\n[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)\n\n[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)\n\n2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.\n\n3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.\n\n[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)\n\nOne of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there\u2019s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they\u2019ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)\n\nThe reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.\n\nOnce ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we\u2019ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.\n\n[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)\n\nDisclaimer, Risks:\n\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.\n\nTLDR:\n\nThe no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.\n\nPositions: 8,000 shares at $6.27\n\n[I prefer a larger share position than options as it is easier to manage risk.

    "title": "ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (1)",
    "selftext": "# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade\n\nIf you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to \u201cbe right,\u201d \u2014 you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.\n\nThe challenge obviously is that it\u2019s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we\u2019ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said \u201cbe something when others are something\u201d? Yes, and today is your opportunity.\n\nRight now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential \u201cmillionaire maker\u201d name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.\n\nI am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.\n\n# 2/ The Background and the Backers\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.\n\nASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite \u201ccell towers\u201d in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn\u2019t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.\n\nAll sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.\n\nRight now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start \u201cunfurling\u201d on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.\n\n[ The BlueWalker 3 satellite and ASTS team. From CEO's Twitter. ](https://preview.redd.it/joua2277fsx91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc623754341c9ceba87b29e4e7bf24a4522f849)\n\nThe TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.\n\nThe guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Twitter of Abel Avellan, the ASTS CEO ](https://preview.redd.it/n73nrqddfsx91.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1809c7766728dcfb05dd2ea34ec8ebf82ba06ad5)\n\nOther direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.\n\n[ From proxy statement in August 2022](https://preview.redd.it/9l285pvgfsx91.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8b86575ace5f6f59ce496165141960c3dcbe1d9)\n\nFrom OpenInsider: Insider transactions from since de-SPAC, all purchases, no selling even when shares unlocked and ASTS spiked 100%+.\n\n[OpenInsider data on ASTS](https://preview.redd.it/k07gq1llfsx91.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9ca63ae5f57047ee7b90916771f2cb3a064126)\n\nThe BELIEVERS:\n\n* Rakuten, American Tower, Vodafone (along w Samsung) did ASTS Series B then PIPE ($230M) investments.\n* Mikitani Hiroshi is billionaire Rakuten CEO backing ASTS with a massive stake.\n* Transhumanica with a detailed research paper that I highly recommend. They have an interactive valuation model with a $114 current PT.\n* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15PT.\n* DB equity research has outstanding $15PT.\n* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.\n\nThe NON-BELIEVERS:\n\n1. Kerrisdale Capital released some short seller research if you\u2019re interested in reading a bear case.\n\n[Kerrisdale Capital caused ASTS to tank in mid September](https://preview.redd.it/a016fkfpfsx91.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08c3f8931bf6fafd5c0acc3006447ed560e4e645)\n\n# 3/ The Astrology and the Price\n\nAs a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.\n\nThe market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It\u2019s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I\u2019d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% \u2013 we\u2019d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it\u2019s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman\u2019s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.\n\nDeutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:\n\n[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/fzv1jlvqfsx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b98ef716b7a1f45f3c4b3174edd0d32e9397b3)\n\nInterestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.\n\nASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock \u201cwinners\u201d they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.\n\n[TradingView of ASTS, 1W time frame](https://preview.redd.it/ojmxwldsfsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9626a7e5b476232e8f6fb981ed415e6c1c7669d5)\n\nASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength \u2014 compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.\n\nPretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% \u2014 during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.\n\nNow we are back at the \u201csupport\u201d or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.\n\n# 4/ The Dangers of a Short Trade and Previous Catalysts\n\nThe no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the \u201ceasy\u201d trade on a company like ASTS that short sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, short sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.\n\nThis year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.\n\n1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious short covering rally that day, where just \u201criding with tide\u201d as a short seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the \u201ceasy\u201d short trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.\n2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of short sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.\n\nAfter Kerrisdale released their short report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 \u201csupport area\u201d and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.\n\nI think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from short sellers relenting as company executes.\n\n# 5/ The New Trade and Upcoming Catalysts\n\nWe have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.\n\n1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.\n\n[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/tt4grepufsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f2bbdd0d7020c98808f9565e0d3db194e3952c)\n\n[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ak8ijvhwfsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5016deb82df34c51e1d9b4d59f9b2ca2bc622c55)\n\n2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.\n\n3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.\n\n[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/dscqmdf0gsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7574cf567c54e293b1ad2b49dfd5a07796b3af71)\n\nOne of the arguments of short sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there\u2019s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they\u2019ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.\n\n[Note on warrant funding](https://preview.redd.it/ezj8i9n2gsx91.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6636812be27cf933dab429f7d34ae9097caac87)\n\nThe reason why I think the moves up are going to be violent is because of high interest from short sellers, including Kerrisdale. A lot of them will have to get out of the way on positive catalysts. Quick information from S3 and Ortex.\n\n[S3 information from Mr. Ihor](https://preview.redd.it/50m9ynmagsx91.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6777efdc98eb8a64f45ca01a22d52fc359ae21b3)\n\n&gt;Information from Ortex: 28.4% SI, 31.1% on loan, CTB 19.4%, DTC 8 days\n\nOnce ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we\u2019ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.\n\n[ASTS, 1D timeframe on TV. Imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/7gi5lhwlgsx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea893f025a23bd720618e445b213e2bad44da647)\n\nDisclaimer, Risks:\n\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero. If you think this is a P&amp;D feel free to short and add fuel to the fire. Good luck.\n\nTLDR:\n\nThe no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after.

Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.\n\nPositions: 8,000 shares at $6.27\n\nI prefer a larger share position than options as it is easier to manage risk. Will add more on positive momentum.",

    "title": "TGIF: TSLA gain (not the minimum required for me to tag gain, but here are some of my thoughts).",
    "selftext": "I hope you all are well! I\u2019m only a year old member of the page, but thought i\u2019d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I\u2019m not a professional at this at all, but thought i\u2019d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options\u2026. But first here was my trade today:\n\nI took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.\n\n\n I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I\u2019ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.\n\n\nI\u2019m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.\n\n\nThings i\u2019ve learned the last year: \n\n\n1. I can\u2019t trade 0dte contracts. It\u2019s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I\u2019m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.\n\n\n2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn\u2019t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.\n\n3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. \u201cPreserve precious capital\u201d as a famous trader says makes sense to me\n\n\n4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.\n\n\n5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.\n\n6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.\n\nI\u2019m not an OG here, but thought i\u2019d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF\n\n\nTLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can\u2019t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking \u2026\n\nBe safe, enjoy your weekend, momentum is real and let it start rolling in the right direction \ud83d\ude00",

So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX &amp; $PIN never triggered, so no play.\n\nBut earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.\n\nEconomic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.\n\nWatchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Tuesday 11/08**\n\nMidterm Elections\n\n**Wednesday 11/09**\n\n11:00 AM Inventories MoM Sep\n\n**Thursday 11/10**\n\n8:30 AM CPI Oct\n\n9:30 AM Inflation Rate YoY Oct\n\n9:30 AM Core Inflation Rate YoY Oct\n\n9:30 AM Inflation Rate MoM Oct\n\n9:30 AM Core Inflation Rate MoM Oct\n\n9:30 AM Intial Jobless Claims till 5 Nov\n\n**Friday 11/11**\n\n11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment\n\nObviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways\n\n**Option 1:**\n\nWait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.\n\n**Option 2:**  \nSpeculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody\u2019s chart  below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d\n\nSo  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)\n\nSo that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed\u2019s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  \u2018\u2019influncers\u2019\u2019 would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.\n\nThe  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  \nRemember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.\n\n# Earnings\n\nMonday 07 Nov\n\n**After Close - Lyft Inc ($LYFT)**\n\n* Transportation\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.069 &amp; Revenue $1.056B\n* Options pricing in a 18.6% move on earnings\n* My  Play: Very bearish flow and $UBER earnings results were mixed too (ran  because of guidance &amp; bookings), going with the flow here, they laid  off alot of employees not a great sign.

But i will 100% find a good for next week.\n\nAlright,  so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going  through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "selftext": "A few things first;\n\n- Elon does not own above 50% of Tesla. \n\n\n- Elon can be fired from Tesla. \n\n\n- Elon is the main reason for TSLA shares to trade so high.\n\n\nQuestion is, is it worth keeping him? \n\n\nIf we solely think of stock performance as a sign of success and well being of a company, Elon can be considered a huge asset. Absurd price of the stock even today is only due to him being the CEO... well sort of was. The sentiment is quickly changing. \n\n\nIMO Elon's job at TESLA is done. The company is sustainable and cannot be outdone by other companies in the global market. Though competition in the Chinese market is too hot for any real benefit in the long run. \n\n\nIn the recent earning report many people were pointing out how margins are falling and inventory was going up. \n\n\nThese are products of high inflation and rising cost of materials. It's nothing out of the ordinary. The fact that the company is still able to grow is what you want to see in this economic climate. \n\n\nToyota's lean inventory management was successful in the last 20 years due to stable commodity markets and a very efficient worldwide shipping network. Today these are both high affected by the pandemic and high inflation. To make it simpler for smooth brains. Cost of storing inventory may be lower than paying more for inventory every month due to highly volatile raw materials. Higher inventory is a sign of preparedness which I welcome.\n\n\nIMO Tesla is here to stay and will still come out on top after the dust settles. \n\n\nBut is TSLA a $200 - $300 stock? Not even close. I think it will land somewhere between $75-90. Many tech companies' valuations are garbage. Tesla will find its place in automotive industry though still be valued slightly above due to its brand recognition and the tech and solar power element of the company. \n\n\nIt's just a matter of deciding when to part ways with Elon and not an if. \n\n\nThis is just my two bananas. \n\n\nTL:DR Tesla may go down to $80/share but that's not necessarily something that will affect the company in a negative way. It may be a relief for management instead.",

Another 279 insiders filed Form 4s, bringing the total filing to 622.\n\nA quick note on Elon - the sales are not represented here **\\*yet\\*** since they are **Indirect** trades and the reports only included **Direct** purchases and sales. **Indirect trades will be added moving forward.**\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases decreased from $76.5M to $53.7M (-30%)\n* Sales decreased from $1.1B to $740M (-31%)\n* Transactions increased from 383 to 679 (+77%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 225 to 394 (+75%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 49 (+96%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 200 to 345 (+73%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 343 to 622 (+81%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 45 to 108 (+140%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 298 to 514 (+72%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 31st - November 4th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d.

Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 24th - October 28th.**\n3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).\n\n# Further Context\n\n1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2.

Wife's boyfriend tried to explain it to me, but not even him could get it through this thick skull of mine.\n\n\nOk, so Elon paid about 45bn on this deal. He had 20bn in cash sitting around apparently. He doesn\u00b4t want to sell TSLA stock for the other 25bn, so he takes loans instead. So far so good.\n\nFrom the 25bn loans, 13bn are just regular loans and 12bn are just margin loans using TSLA stock as collateral. This is the first thing I don\u00b4t understand. Why only 12bn are margin loans? Why would the banks accept to loan 13bn with no collateral?\n\nAnd the collaterals, are they a specified number of shares or a specified dollar worth of shares?\n\nThen there's the fact that the Twitter company itself got leveraged to the tits during the deal? How? Was it just a clause in the contract that the company had to take a lot of leverage beforehand or Elon wouldn't buy it? If so, why not just takeover the company first and than get the debt later?",

    "selftext": "On Nov 9th, three major stock index continues to fall, stopped three consecutive gains. By the close, the Dow was down 1.95% the Nasdaq down 2.48%and the S&amp;P down 2.08%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 1.066% to 4.084%, with a gap of about -50 basis points over the two-year note. The fear index, known as the VIX, rose 2.15%. Brent crude closed down 2.92 %. Spot gold settled down 0.43% at $1,705.17 an ounce. The dollar index remained higher against a basket of six major currencies, closing at 110.48.\n\nSPY\n\nSPY had a common gap down at the open and somehow held Tuesday\u2019s low with a bounce in the morning. Then SPY broke Tuesday\u2019s low solidly and formed a clear intraday down trend. On the daily chart, SPY is at equilibrium now. Just watch $368.79 on the downside and the short-term resistance should be around $390. MACD indicators for SPY is about to have a death cross, this could be a significant signal for technical traders.\n\nQQQ\n\nQQQ held Tuesday\u2019s low pretty well in the morning after the common gap down. Then QQQ also went down in the afternoon and formed an Intraday down trend. $259 is a significant pivot point on the downside.\n\nDIA\n\nDIA also held Tuesday\u2019s low in the morning and on the daily chart, it is back to equilibrium area with a price correction. On the weekly chart, DIA is forming a double bottom since March, while the pattern is not confirmed until it breaks the high on Aug.16th. However, if we scroll back a little more, DIA\u2019s weekly chart is forming a rounded top. Whether to go long or short, it depends on traders\u2019 attitude towards the market. \n\nXLF\n\nThe financial industry met previous expectation and made a price correction, it has a strong resistance above $34 since 09/12. XLF closed back in equilibrium area, pay attention to how it reacts to the upper band of the equilibrium area.\n\nXLI\n\nXLI also experienced a price correction, but unlike XLF, XLI is still extended on the upside. It will not be surprised if another red day follow up and back to equilibrium. \n\nMost popular tech stocks ended in the red. Apple fell 3.32% on news that the company's first AR glasses have encountered design problems, affecting the 2024 launch. Microsoft fell 1.91 percent as the company faces a new EU antitrust complaint about its cloud computing business; European Union antitrust regulators have launched a sweeping investigation into Microsoft's $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard. Meta, up 5.18%, will cut 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its team, and freeze hiring until Q1 next year. \n\n[TSLA](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-TSLA/)\n\n[Tesla](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-TSLA/) shares fell 7.17%, closing at their lowest level in about two years, after Musk sold at least 19.5 million shares worth $3.95 billion. Unlike the market, Tesla didn\u2019t experience a large gap down at the open. Although it dropped 1.82% during the first 5 min, TSLA then rally back to $195.85, breaking Tuesday\u2019s high but failed to fill the breakaway gap on Tuesday. On the daily chart, TSLA made a new low for the last two years and broke the pivot point $179.83, which was the low on 03/05/2021. Currently TSLA\u2019s RSI14 is at 24, traders can consider this as an oversold signal, but it depends on how you use the indicator.\n\n[AMZN](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMZN/)\n\n[Amazon](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMZN/) fell 4.27% as Amazon Cloud Technology signed strategic cooperation agreements on innovation with Takeda Pharmaceutical and Accenture. With open as the intraday high, AMZN kept making lower highs and lower lows until the last two hours before close. The daily chart looks pretty bearish with down trend consistency and its RSI14 is also below 30 now.",

    "selftext": "*Short term noise*\n\nA stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. \n\nThe twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it\u2019s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \n\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it\u2019s stress maybe he\u2019s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I\u2019ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that\u2019s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m debating here. \n\n*\u201dDD\u201d*\n\nTesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \n\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I\u2019m sure some of you could say otherwise. \n\nTesla is a car company, but it\u2019s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That\u2019s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don\u2019t look like a car maker. \n\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it\u2019s not effecting sales but regardless it\u2019s getting better and it\u2019s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you\u2019re delusional, it\u2019s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \n\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from \u201cluxury\u201d but it\u2019s durable and practical. For $50k it\u2019s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it\u2019s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don\u2019t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \n\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. \n\nVW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They\u2019re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we\u2019ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \n\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. \u201cSome years will be a little less some will be a little more.\u201d Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \n\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. \n\nThe economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don\u2019t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won\u2019t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it\u2019s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who\u2019s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.\n\nChina is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They\u2019re moving into Europe, I don\u2019t see them moving to North American markets soon. It\u2019s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they\u2019re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I\u2019d buy their stock if they weren\u2019t IOUs from the CCP. \n\nI haven\u2019t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn\u2019t include  FSD because it\u2019s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don\u2019t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. \n\nTLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.\n\nPosition 33.69 shares (ik I\u2019m poor).",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to say I appreciate all of your kind comments and DMs. I'm sorry I couldn't get back to each and every single one of you guys I'm just a bit overwhelmed by the number of interactions I got in my last post. Love you all, and wish you all the best. For everyone asking what my next moves are here it is:\n\nAs of right now, I believe the bear market rally is coming to an end. Maybe there is a bit more upside, but I don't want to miss the downside. I personally like the risk-to-reward here.\n\nTA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200 day SMA SPY,  FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \\~3490, sentiment etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally. Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on.\n\nI am short \n\nNFLX\n\nCMG\n\nGS\n\nMy only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.\n\n**But be aware, I will scale in and out of these short positions on a whim. I have a HUGE short/long watchlist, and if I sense there is money to be made elsewhere I will rotate my money.**\n\nStuff on my watchlist\n\n$COIN\n\n$AAPL\n\n$TSLA\n\n$TMUS\n\n$CAT\n\n$DE\n\n$LI\n\nand a ton of other stocks.\n\nThis is not financial advice, this is for the people curious about what my next move is. \n\nAlso, I don't recommend anyone to short as the asymmetry is against you when shorting. Your losses can be infinite, while your gains are capped at 100% (unless using leverage). Good luck my fellow brethren.\n\n[Largest accounts 1 &amp; 2. Took profits like I said I would on $ASTS.

    "selftext": "Here's what Elon has done in the past couple weeks at Twitter.\n\n* **Fired key executives:** Eliminated those responsible for Twitter's key problem of being a bot haven\n* **\"Hardcore\" rallying call**: Eliminates unnecessary bloat and keeps dedicated workers\n* **Starting &amp; stopping $8 program**: A short demonstration to advertisers that Twitter is no longer cow-towing to special interests\n* **Publicly fires critics:** Shows he isn't a spineless leader and is willing to take decisive action\n* **Asks for print-outs of code:** Puts his engineers on notice that he is scrutinizing their work and they need to be able to defend it\n\nAll of these actions display a level of decisiveness and ruthlessness that was lacking in Twitter's leadership. This also bodes well for TSLA, which is down nearly 20% in the last 30 days.\n\nInvestors have mispriced TSLA, and the stock will rebound as Musk's masterful turnaround of Twitter becomes more apparent.\n\nTSLA will mean-revert to $300 by January.",

    "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen \n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  \nIn this post, we will cover\n\n* This week\u2019s Earnings\n* This Week's Major Economic Events\n* This week\u2019s Watchlist\n* This Week\u2019s lotto 10 bagger Play\n\n**$2k to $100k Challenge Update**\n\nLast week was an OK week, earnings did what earnings do best and didn't move as per numbers that came out, sometimes for our benefit sometimes against us, for the most part, the market chopped for a full week.\n\nFor Earnings we had NVDA, HD, and BABA, NVDA misses but ran a little and then died by open, IV crush got the best of the puts, and BABA puts also fared the same way, even though we were wrong BABA died despite beating earnings but not enough. HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays. \n\nOur 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.\n\nFor those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.\n\n**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014  \n**Port % Change:** 1001%\n\n**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  \n**Port % Change**: 102%\n\nWe are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, im currently have \n\n* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C\n* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C\n* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C\n* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C\n* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C\n* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C\n* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C\n* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktsckvjk471a1.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd43491be55f5724603e31a41f722b82e9a3653a\n\nAnd plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so its pull the account value down, i got alot of time on most these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\nThis is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on. \n\nWe got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much. \n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Wednesday 11/09**\n\n8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct  \n9:45 AM S&amp;P PMI Flash Nov  \n2:00 PM FOMC Minutes\n\nAs i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Monday 21 Nov\n\n**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**\n\n* Technology Services\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.832 &amp; Revenue $1.09B\n* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.\n\n# Tue 22 Nov\n\n**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.032 &amp; Revenue $10.3B\n* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings\n* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell\n\n# Wed 22 Nov\n\n**Before Open - Deere &amp; Company ($DE)**\n\n* Industrial\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST\n* Estimates: EPS $7.12 &amp; Revenue $13.5B\n* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.\n\nOther notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE \n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- NFLX Long**\n\nRight at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b822iml471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7ca2769c4f20251ab7413e26ee0305c6452ee9\n\n**- META Long**\n\nHolding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se5xtv8m471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a49615a9f7b4f176a5517366fb5f1fde90cb3ec6\n\n**- TSLA Long/Short**\n\nAt major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04ud0cwm471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7d0bb3d61d723824c57302a3b727410c5560c5\n\n**- COIN Long**\n\nCrypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb\n\n**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**\n\nNo 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "selftext": "Tesla shares have shed more than $700 billion in market value since peaking in early November of last year, but analysts now suggest the carmaker is poised for a comeback.\n\nTesla\u00a0 (**TSLA**) shares moved firmly higher Wednesday after analysts at Citigroup lifted their rating on the clean-energy carmaker while Morgan Stanley noted that the stock's $500 billion slump maybe coming to an end.\n\nCitigroup analyst Itay Michaeli lifted his rating on Tesla to 'neutral' from 'sell', while boosting his price target by around $35 to $176 per share, arguing the stock's year-to-date decline of around 58% has \"balanced out the near-term risk/reward\" for Tesla investors.\n\n\"To be sure, macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising, but as we\u2019ve previously written, in a hard landing scenario Tesla\u2019s long-term competitive position likely also improves and potentially further enhanced by (President Joe Biden's inflation reduction act),\" Michaeli wrote.\u00a0\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, said Tesla shares are \"approaching our $150 bear case, driven by price cuts in China, decelerating EV demand and other market currents.\"\u00a0\n\nJonas, who carries an 'overweight' rating with a $330 price target on Tesla stock, said that while the ongoing distraction of CEO Elon Musk's foray into Twitter will likely expose investors to added risks, the group remains on pace to grow sales by around 37% next year, generate $15 billion in free-cash-flow and consolidate its position as the word's dominant EV player.\n\n\"We believe Tesla's 'gap-to-competition' can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary,\" Jonas wrote. \"With respect to the (inflation reduction act) we believe Tesla is by far the best positioned OEM in terms of potential eligibility for consumer tax and production credits.\"\n\nFull article: [https://www.thestreet.com/markets/tesla-stock-jumps-as-bulls-bears-say-500-billion-slump-overdone](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/tesla-stock-jumps-as-bulls-bears-say-500-billion-slump-overdone)\n\nTesla (TSLA) is currently up 5.87% after analysts at Citigroup lifted their rating on the EV giant and Morgan Stanley noted that the stock's $500 billion slump maybe coming to an end.

It was a smart move by Elon to buy twitter so that he can unload his fortune on everyone while continuing to bang his coworkers. He is probably gonna end up farming another family on twitter. After that he\u2019s gonna buy another company and create another family there. Dogecoin is gonna die too. Everything headed to zero. Good luck guys",

    "selftext": "As the title states, this company in my eyes is way overvalued at $600B which at one point it hit $1T mkt cap.\n\nP/E ratio of like 51.87 and that is as of current.\n\nShares outstanding are 3.16B, that\u2019s with a B, billion.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think it\u2019s a great company with the potential for good growth depending on how shit plays out, but, not the type of growth to even give its current evaluation, plus, they may be going into negative earnings territory in the near future depending on what unfolds with the state of our economy etc.\n\nAdditionally, it has a higher market cap then the majority of top auto manufacturers combined.\n\nSo long story short, what entices you to buy and hold TSLA shares? Not talking about options, but shares?\n\nI know this is not a new topic, but given our global economic state, I am very curious to peoples perspectives as of present date.",

Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.\n\n**GDP Q3**\n\nSo we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.\n\nThis month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.\n\nWith USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts\n\n**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**JPow Speech**\n\nJPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.\n\nA lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.\n\nI think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.\n\n**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**PCE**\n\nNow we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.\n\n**JPow play:  SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Wed 30 Nov\n\n**After Close - Snowflake ($SNOW)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.042 &amp; Revenue $539.4M\n* Options pricing in a 15.7% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is very mixed on this, can't see an edge but a big implied move so taking a straddle here\n\n**After Close - Salesforce ($CRM)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.2 &amp; Revenue $7.8B\n* Options pricing in a 9.9% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bullish, but not a very high confidence play either, playing it safe straddling this one too\n\n# Wed 1 Dec\n\n**After Close - Marvell ($MRVL)**\n\n* Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.58 &amp; Revenue $1.5B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish and so am i, every semi company ran of earnings, taking 12/09 45c\n\n**After Close - Dollar General ($DG)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $2.53 &amp; Revenue $9.4B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish,DLTR did beat earnings but missed guidance. I think we get more of the same, Taking 12/09 255p\n\nOther notable earnings this week: $KR $TD.DO $BMO\n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- NFLX Long**\n\nI'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vaafsrxmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dcc6795c04099a286f3027b76883bc088928996\n\n**- AAPL Long**\n\nHas been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvy6evpymo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496a4a6a6a31afe0aae0c1fc2d20e095c13e4709\n\n**- TSLA Long**  \nWe got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mstw3cizmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c6cc55ed54d5d42911f8bf050743b74e73df37\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nMy 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.\n\nI\u2019ll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.\n\nIf my assumptions are correct with this week\u2019s events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i\u2019ll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr65x390no2a1.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=416cb8e5a7401db4cc374a26d62efc4024460e4d\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "title": "My Full Plan for this Week 11/28 + Challenge Update (4 Earnings Plays, 3 MAJOR Economic Event , 3 Stocks + 10x Lotto)",
    "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen \n\nI'm ash and i write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.  \nIn this post, we will cover\n\n* This week\u2019s Earnings\n* This Week's Major Economic Events\n* This week\u2019s Watchlist\n* This Week\u2019s lotto 10 bagger Play\n\n# $2k to $100k Challenge Update\n\nLast week was almost Perfect, we almost got everything on the watchlist right on the money, no one can get all their plays perfectly obviously so the weeks where we do is cause for celebration at least for me.\n\nFor Earnings, we had $ZM puts, $DE puts, and $BBY calls. All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE. \n\nAs for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$. \n\nFor those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.\n\n**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  \n**Port % Change:** 1101%\n\n**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  \n**Port % Change**: 102%\n\nWe also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts. \n\nCashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out. \n\nAveraged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March \u201823 swing.  \n\nAs we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.\n\nSo overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have   \n\n\n* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C\n* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C\n* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C\n* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C\n* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C\n* TSLA 03/17/2022 220.00 C  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6uxkb2cdo2a1.png?width=1835&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd77448e4141cbd01072dc679d362107af4235cf\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 11/28**\n\n10:30 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Nov\n\n**Tuesday 11/29**\n\n9:00 AM S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price YoY Sep  \n10:00 AM CB Consumer Confidence Nov\n\n**Wednesday 11/30**  \n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Nov\n\n8:30 AM GDP Growth Rate QoQ 2nd Est Q3\n\n8:30 AM Goods Trade Balance Adv OCT\n\n8:30 AM Corporate Profits QoQ Prel Q3\n\n9:30 AM Wholesale Inventories MoM Adv OCT\n\n9:30 AM GDP Price Index QoQ 2nd Est Q3\n\n9:30 AM GDP Retail Inventories Ex Autos MoM Adv OCT\n\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI Nov\n\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Oct\n\n10:00 AM Pending Home Sales MoM/YoY Oct\n\n01:30 PM Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Speech - Brookings Institution   \n\n\n**Thursday 12/01**\n\n8:30 AM Personal Spending MoM OCT\n\n8:30 AM Personal Income MoM OCT\n\n8:30 AM PCE Price Index MoM/YoY OCT\n\n8:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims 26th Nov\n\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global Manafaurting PMI Final Nov\n\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Nov\n\n**Friday 12/02**\n\n8:30 AM Non-Farm Payrolls NOV\n\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate NOV\n\nMan last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.\n\n**GDP Q3**\n\nSo we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter. \n\nThis month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession. \n\nWith USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts\n\n**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**JPow Speech** \n\nJPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows. \n\nA lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.\n\nI think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient. \n\n**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n**PCE**\n\nNow we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.\n\n**JPow play:  SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Wed 30 Nov\n\n**After Close - Snowflake ($SNOW)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.042 &amp; Revenue $539.4M\n* Options pricing in a 15.7% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is very mixed on this, can't see an edge but a big implied move so taking a straddle here\n\n**After Close - Salesforce ($CRM)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.2 &amp; Revenue $7.8B\n* Options pricing in a 9.9% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bullish, but not a very high confidence play either, playing it safe straddling this one too\n\n# Wed 1 Dec\n\n**After Close - Marvell ($MRVL)**\n\n* Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.58 &amp; Revenue $1.5B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish and so am i, every semi company ran of earnings, taking 12/09 45c\n\n**After Close - Dollar General ($DG)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $2.53 &amp; Revenue $9.4B\n* Options pricing in a 12% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is bullish,DLTR did beat earnings but missed guidance.

    "selftext": "\u201cOur investor survey reinforces our views that Elon Musk's recent involvement with Twitter has contributed to negative sentiment momentum in Tesla shares,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.\n\nTesla\u00a0 (**TSLA**)\u00a0investors see Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter as having both a negative impact on the carmaker's share price and the potential to ultimately erode its underlying fundamentals, a Morgan Stanley survey indicated Tuesday.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a long-time Tesla bull, noted the bank's recent investor survey found that nearly two-thirds of those polled said Musk's $44 billion purchase of the social media platform would have a \"slight negative\" or \"very negative\" impact on Tesla's business. Around 30% felt Musk's involvement would be \"neutral\" for the carmaker, while only 5% saw it as a net positive.\u00a0\n\nJonas, who carries an 'overweight' rating with a $330 price target on Tesla stock, said last week that while the ongoing distraction of CEO Elon Musk's foray into Twitter will likely expose investors to added risks, the group remains on pace to grow sales by around 37% next year, generate $15 billion in free-cash-flow and consolidate its position as the word's dominant EV player.\n\n\u201cOur investor survey reinforces our views that Elon Musk's recent involvement with Twitter has contributed to negative sentiment momentum in [T](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA)esla shares and could drive some degree of adverse downside skew to Tesla fundamentals.\u201d\n\nTesla shares were marked 1.4% higher in pre-market trading Tuesday to indicate an opening bell price of $185.53 each, a move that would still leave the stock down more than 50% since Musk made his intentions to buy Twitter public in early April.\n\nLast week,\u00a0 Citigroup\u00a0analyst Itay Michaeli lifted his rating on Tesla to 'neutral' from 'sell', while boosting his price target by around $35 to $176 per share, arguing the stock's year-to-date decline of around 58% has \"balanced out the near-term risk/reward\" for Tesla investors.\n\n\"To be sure, macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising, but as we\u2019ve previously written, in a hard landing scenario Tesla\u2019s long-term competitive position likely also improves and potentially further enhanced by (President Joe Biden's inflation reduction act),\" Michaeli wrote.\u00a0\n\nFull article: [https://www.thestreet.com/markets/tesla-sentiment-fundamentals-affected-by-musks-twitter-purchase](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/tesla-sentiment-fundamentals-affected-by-musks-twitter-purchase)\n\n\u2018Elon Musk's recent involvement with Twitter has contributed to negative sentiment momentum in Tesla (TSLA) shares,\u2019 said Morgan Stanley analyst.

Short Float hit over whopping 30% as borrow rate to short increases.  Fisker Asset Light Business Model ALBM is more efficient then Tesla $TSLA as it transfers low value add processes to outsourced third parties Foxconn, Magna both incentivized with equity. Apple $APPL has proven this to be a very efficient model and a better use of allocating resources to IP, Patents and Marketing/Customer Service.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",

    "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and I write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover\n\n* This week\u2019s Earnings\n* This Week's Major Economic Events\n* This week\u2019s Watchlist\n* This Week\u2019s lotto 10 bagger Play\n\n# $2k to $100k Challenge Update\n\nBig Week, we made a lot of $$$ correctly calling that JPow will be dovish, as a matter of fact, the day of the meeting after we had a bunch of reports come out in the am (and the market reacting poorly to them) I doubled downed a said we will a surprisingly dovish JPow based on the numbers we got that morning, and we did!**Proof:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7ih4q7ctw3a1.jpg?width=447&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37926c13317f7ea38b2f9b4da5e18bd75909b962\n\nWe will go more in-depth into what he said later on as it changes a lot of things now.\n\nWe also nailed GDP and PCE predictions as well.\n\nJob numbers were surprising on Friday, usually, these don't really have an effect on the market that's why I had no play for them, but since JPow said it's a key focus moving on forward, the market took a hit on bad numbers. (they are not as bad as people think, ill explain when we discuss the next job numbers plays),\n\nFor earnings, MRVL paid off as it ran hard before the earnings at which point I got out (because why risk it with earnings, IV crush, etc\u2026) but the earnings play itself was wrong, so an L there, DG puts paid off well.\n\nFrom the watchlist, NFLX was an absolute BEAST, sold at 300%+, and re-entered some more for that gap fill, been pounding the table on that one for weeks and we keep banking off it!\n\nOur 10x play VIX puts, was successful as well, it didn't 10x but still went 22.5 to 19, 200-300% play ( I didn't take the play btw)\n\nFor those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.\n\n**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  \n**Day 38 Closing Amount:** $14,097  \n**Port % Change:** 1410%\n\n**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  \n**Day 38 Closing Amount:** $1918  \n**Port % Change**: 102%\n\nI sold most of my swings from last week as they ran 50-500%+,Sold COIN at loss (what a turd), Sold AMD at breakeven (I'm an idiot lol), TQQQ (50%-70%), NFLX (300%+), SPX (100%-500%), TSLA (50%-100%)\n\nLike I said last week as we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash,\n\nI have now around $12K in cash and hold\n\n* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C\n* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C\n* SPX 12/08/2022 220.00 C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/42wby53dtw3a1.png?width=1795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a155eaf925cf5c0c81397c37c33dfd21298065c7\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 12/05**\n\n10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Nov)\n\n**Thursday 12/08**\n\n08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims\n\n**Friday 12/09**\n\n08:30 AM Core PPI (MoM) (Nov)\n\n08:30 AM Core PPI (YoY) (Nov)\n\n10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Expectations (Dec)\n\n10:00 AM Wholesale Inventories (MoM)\n\nSo normally the only important event this week would be offcourse PPI and for the most part, it is, but after JPow made it clear how workforce participation is the final part to tame inflation, people will be keeping an eye on the initial Jobless claims.\n\nWhile this is not a  job report, we can expect some sort of market reaction to it, especially given how poorly the Friday report did. Now speaking of the Friday report, The reason why it was so off is that household surveys and NFP are measured in very different ways, likely people with jobs or the gig economy are skewing the data. ADP report showed us that people are still losing jobs. I think we will be ok here, but it's a little too soon to tell.\n\nPPI is going to be a very important report, usually, it comes after CPI, and usually, it follows it, so it might be safe to assume if PPI is good so will CPI and vice versa.PPI YoY  is expected to come in at 7.2% vs 8% Previous and MoM 0.2% vs 0.2% Previous\n\nCore PPI YoY  is expected to come in at 5.9% vs 6.7% Previous and MoM 0.2% vs 0% Previous\n\nSo it seems that forecasts are pretty dovish here, and if we are able to meet expectations or beat we should get a nice run as people start to price in a CPI beat as well, and not only that but our second PPI report decline in a row.\n\nI think we continue the trend here and we meet expectations, there are a lot of price reductions that weren't even priced in yet from the last report, so ill be getting an ATM SPX Call 12/14 on Thursday as a play for PPI.\n\n# Earnings\n\nPS we played all these earnings before in my 1st or 2nd weekly watchlist, we have come full circle, nice!\n\n# Mon 5 Dec\n\n**After Close - GitLab Inc. ($GTLB)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $-0.154 &amp; Revenue $106M\n* Options pricing in a 16.4% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish, and tech missed for the most part, but GTLB has been beasting the past few earnings and RBC &amp; BofA expect a beat, I'm going with calls on this one.\n\n# Thurs 8 Dec\n\n**After Close - Lululemon Athletica Inc. ($LULU)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.96 &amp; Revenue $1.81B\n* Options pricing in an 8.8% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is very bullish, Long lines this holiday, shows how resilient this stock is. Taking calls.\n\n**After Close - DocuSign Inc ($DOCU)**\n\n* Technology\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 PM EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $626.9M\n* Options pricing in a 17.8% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is very bearish as is to be expected, I don't understand why there is a 10B company just for signing documents, taking puts\n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- AMZN Long**\n\nAMZN ran on record holiday shopping numbers but has since lagged behind, if it is able to hold 21MA on the daily, it can bounce to the 50MA, taking a swing position if 21MA holds\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dhgxmzzgtw3a1.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22e8e704489e08bcc101604aa170b9dcc9ab6e0a\n\n**- MRVL Long**\n\nDespite earnings, MRVL has great fundamentals and a great-looking chart, looking to add a long position here, will cut below 50MA. Holding for 200MA test\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/os9jwpujtw3a1.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=724bf8c70eea712388f02c4f7b9cfd913e9242bc\n\n**- AMD Long**\n\nAMD has been stuck in a channel for a while now, if it is able to break through the $79 resistance, this can quickly test the 200MA, Will wait for the trigger to enter a position\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84pxx2cmtw3a1.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ce41986a94e06d21ca0bf96b652224d9f61076c\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nThis is the 3rd im doing NFLX as 10x play but, we made a lot of $$ on it the first 2 times, Taking the same week 325c for the gap fill, That is a $10 move to $330. The speed at which the gap fills will determine how much $$ we make, so fingers crossed for a 1-day fill.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49jcgw8otw3a1.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50728cf717133d1f6183272e825d1b8bec5a7db2\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice!",

Very soon after the stock started dropping in the pre market, which later the article was debunked by Tesla and reported again by Reuters. \n\nAnother possibility is Elon selling, which just happened to seem like a sell off on the \u201cbad news\u201d which I find possible because 6% drop on news that was later debunked seems like a lot. \n\nEither way, huge overreaction from the market today (unless is was Musk). China is apparently cutting back on restrictions, so hopefully there are no future surprises in Shanghai production. \n\nWhat do you apes think about the sell off today",

Too busy around the house. Will be taking first half of next week off due to FOMC.\n\n# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\nAt the end of a week that saw recession fears resurface and a higher-than-expected inflation reading just a few days before the Fed's decision, stock traders took risk off the table.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 extended losses in the final hour of trading after trading sideways for the majority of the session. Treasury 10-year yields have risen to near 3.6%. The dollar wavered.\n\nShort-term inflation expectations in the US unexpectedly fell to their lowest level in more than a year, and consumer sentiment improved, aided by lower gasoline prices. In a separate report, producer prices rose more than expected in November, driven by services, highlighting the stickiness of inflationary pressures that supports Fed interest-rate increases through 2023.\n\nIn the run-up to the Fed meeting, all eyes will be on Tuesday's consumer inflation print, which is expected to show that inflation, while still far too high, has slowed. US central bankers, including chair Jerome Powell, have signalled a slowing in the pace of rate hikes while stressing that borrowing costs must continue to rise and remain restrictive for some time in order to beat inflation.\n\nAccording to the federal open market committee's median projection, the benchmark will peak at 4.9% in 2023, reflecting a 4.75%-5% target range, up from 4.6% in September. That would come as a surprise to investors, who currently expect rates to be cut by a half percentage point in the second half of next year, with rates peaking around 4.9%. Currently, the range is between 3.75% and 4%.  \nWhile many investors are eager for the Fed to deliver its final rate hike, BoA strategists believe they should be cautious while inflation remains high.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n* **\\[08:32 ET\\]** Putin: We will consider reducing oil output as a response to oil price cap.

Too busy around the house. Will be taking first half of next week off due to FOMC.\n\n# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\nAt the end of a week that saw recession fears resurface and a higher-than-expected inflation reading just a few days before the Fed's decision, stock traders took risk off the table.\n\n  \nThe S&amp;P 500 extended losses in the final hour of trading after trading sideways for the majority of the session. Treasury 10-year yields have risen to near 3.6%. The dollar wavered.\n\n  \nShort-term inflation expectations in the US unexpectedly fell to their lowest level in more than a year, and consumer sentiment improved, aided by lower gasoline prices. In a separate report, producer prices rose more than expected in November, driven by services, highlighting the stickiness of inflationary pressures that supports Fed interest-rate increases through 2023.\n\n  \nIn the run-up to the Fed meeting, all eyes will be on Tuesday's consumer inflation print, which is expected to show that inflation, while still far too high, has slowed. US central bankers, including chair Jerome Powell, have signalled a slowing in the pace of rate hikes while stressing that borrowing costs must continue to rise and remain restrictive for some time in order to beat inflation.\n\n  \nAccording to the federal open market committee's median projection, the benchmark will peak at 4.9% in 2023, reflecting a 4.75%-5% target range, up from 4.6% in September. That would come as a surprise to investors, who currently expect rates to be cut by a half percentage point in the second half of next year, with rates peaking around 4.9%. Currently, the range is between 3.75% and 4%.  \nWhile many investors are eager for the Fed to deliver its final rate hike, BoA strategists believe they should be cautious while inflation remains high.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n* **\\[08:32 ET\\]** Putin: We will consider reducing oil output as a response to oil price cap.

    "title": "Tesla stock is trading at its \u2018cheapest valuation\u2019 in years, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives says",
    "selftext": "The steep slide in Tesla's (TSLA) stock price this year is starting to catch the eye of valuation watchers.\n\n\"Not since 2018 has Tesla traded at these levels,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. \"On an EV/EBITDA \\[earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\\] basis it\u2019s the cheapest valuation to date.\"\n\nIves \u2014 a former Tesla bull who made headlines in mid-November for removing the EV maker's stock from Wedbush's best ideas list \u2014 isn't too far off on Tesla's stock being noticeably cheap relative to historical norms.\n\nTesla's stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 32 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. That's an almost 70% discount from its historical average multiple. And from a forward EV/EBITDA multiple perspective, Tesla stock is trading at a 53% discount from its historical average.\n\nShares trade at steep discounts from forward enterprise value to EBIT \\[earnings before interest and taxes\\] and enterprise value to sales standpoints, too.\n\nThese valuation metrics only compressed further on Tuesday amid another 4% slide in Tesla's stock, which led to Tesla having the most-visited ticker page on Yahoo Finance.\n\nYear to date, shares have nosedived about 54%.\n\nAnalysts such as Ives point to a few factors driving the Tesla stock plunge that wiped out more than $260 billion in market cap this year.\n\nFirst, the risk of operational miscues at Tesla has grown as Elon Musk works around the clock to fix his newest portfolio company Twitter.\n\n\"Musk has gone from a superhero to Tesla\u2019s stock to a villain in the eyes of the Street as the overhang grows with each tweet,\" Ives said.\n\nSecond, concerns remain around manufacturing issues and the pace of sales for Tesla in China amid an uncertain approach to COVID-19 policies.\n\nAnd lastly, competition in the EV space in the United States has only intensified this year \u2014 raising the risk of slowing growth for Tesla in 2023 and beyond.\n\n Full article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-is-trading-at-its-cheapest-valuation-in-years-wedbushs-dan-ives-says-190147306.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-is-trading-at-its-cheapest-valuation-in-years-wedbushs-dan-ives-says-190147306.html)\n\nTesla (TSLA) is currently down more than 4% and fell to its new year low today despite a latest CPI print that came in lower-than-expected. How much further do you think TSLA will fall for the remainder of the year? Do you think TSLA will reach $140 or below by end of this year?",

The purchase was valued around $11.7 million, based on Wednesday\u2019s closing price of $156.80.\n\nThe snap-up by ARK also comes after Tesla's own chief executive officer Elon Musk sold approximately 21,995,000 shares of the company, or roughly $3.6 billion worth, during the three-day period ending Dec. 14, a regulatory filing showed after Wednesday's close.\n\nARK\u2019s Tesla buy comprised 61,537 shares for the ARK Innovation fund (ARKK), 10,066 for the ARK Autonomous Tech. &amp; Robotics ETF (ARKQ), and 3,259 for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). Tesla is the third largest holding among ARK\u2019s suite of investment products after Zoom Communications (ZM) and Exact Sciences (EXAS).\n\nWood's dip-buying spree comes during a difficult month amid a difficult year for Tesla as concerns intensify among investors that Musk as CEO diverted his attention away from the company to manage Twitter, the social media platform he recently acquired in a $44 billion take-private deal.\n\nTesla stock is down more than 19% in December so far and roughly 55% year-to-date.

    "selftext": " I don't know if I missed this information before, but a pathological lier like Elon Musk, wouldnt be suprising at all if he is using financial engineering\n\nGordon Johnson from GLJ Research - ranked by Bloomberg among the top stock pickers in the steel, iron ore, graphite electrode, electric vehicle, and solar spaces since initiating coverage in 2008 - writes\n\n&gt;In short, we believe the numbers TSLA reports are largely \"fiction,\" resulting from aggressive accounting applied via the Shanghai plant, among other \"tricks\" used. And, given modeling numbers that are \"fiction\" is impossible, this time (i.e., for 3Q22), we aren\u2019t going to even try (we see LARGE incentive for E. Musk to be as aggressive as possible, from an accounting perspective, given he has \\~$15B-$20B worth of shares still left to sell to close the Twitter buyout... by our calculation). That is, using one example of TSLA's many accounting shenanigans, while pretty much every other automaker includes R&amp;D in the gross profit they report, TSLA pushes this metric below the gross profit line, allowing it to claim industry leading margins; yet, when adjusting R&amp;D out of COGS for TSLA, TSLA\u2019s margins rank 11th among global automakers according to Bloomberg.  \nSource: Gordon Johnson from GLJ Research\n\nGLJ Research's analysts give 5 reasons to believe TSLA is artificially boosting its revenue numbers:\n\n1. Revenues up 56% (YoY) amid expenses up only 2% (YoY);\n2. CAPEX is flat (YoY) when construction of Berlin and Austin is done, which seems impossible. TSLA may be capitalizing more expenses than it should on the balance sheet, thus possibly overstating margins;\n3. TSLA's SG&amp;A is still running at $1B/qtr, roughly the same as two years ago, despite selling 2x as many cars;\n4. Gross margins staying up with 2 new factories open, making just a fraction of their vehicle capacity;\n5. Inventory is up 98% (YoY) while sales up 56%. Inventory should keep pace with sales, not outpace it - unless you capitalize raw materials for inventory which you can't move and don't impair so as not to take a profit hit.\n\nPUTS ON TESLA!\n\nIf anyone has better insights about Tesla accounting practices about Tesla, it would be very appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Two days ago I grabbed a few grand of 12/16 puts at strike 150 on tesla.  Made a small profit selling around noon today, but tbh was hoping/ expecting a way bigger move today.  With Elon Musk selling leading into his blackout period for earnings combined with being generally unstable, it def felt like there should have been enough volume and negative sentiment to push through 150 today... yet it held like a brick wall.  The best explanation I have read so far pointed to ([https://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla](https://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla)) stating that the \"market makers\" would lose a lot of money if Tesla was able to push through 150 today which had a rather large spike of open interest and as such had strong incentive to stop that from happening.  So my question to you guys: How are market makers setting up a hard stop like this, and how can I play it better in the future (presuming I want to maximally profit from a reasonably strong confidence in continued downward pressure)?    \n\n\nWithout any more information, I am thinking that in a similar event in the future, I will sell earlier in the day when the iv spiked on the initial drop, then wait till the end of the day and buy weeklies for the following friday at the same or lower strike.  My thought being that market makers are likely buying up whatever volume of TSLA stock to hold the line on friday and accepting the 1:1 loss before unloading on Monday rather than paying out the 100:1 leverage of options that they presumably sold?  Again tho I am pretty new and ignorant to the particulars of how this works and would appreciate any advice or deeper explanation.",

(TSLA) higher on hopes that Musk will refocus his attention on the electric car company he also heads up. \n\nMusk has been running Twitter for 53 days, during which time he's laid off a large percentage of the company's workforce and drawn criticism recently for suspending the accounts of four journalists and then reinstating them. \n\nAdditionally, on Sunday, Twitter announced it would ban accounts that post links or usernames for certain \"prohibited\" third-party social media platforms, only to seemingly rescind the rule about 12 hours later after it stirred more controversy.",

    "selftext": " Yo WallStreetBets,\n\nI just had a genius idea for making some serious cash. TSLA, baby! You know, that stock with the cool electric cars? Yeah, that one.\n\nI mean, I don't really know much about it, but I heard it's going to be worth a ton of money soon. And since electric cars are like the future, and TSLA is making them, I'm pretty sure they're going to make a ton of money. And they're doing other stuff too, like solar panels and home batteries. That's like super eco-friendly and trendy, so I'm sure that's going to make them a ton of cash too.\n\nPlus, I heard the demand for EVs is only going to keep going up. That means TSLA is going to keep making more and more money. It's a no-brainer, really.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"But what about the risks?\" Pfft, who cares about risks? TSLA is a sure thing. Just throw all your money at it and watch it grow. Trust me, it's the smart thing to do.\n\nSo yeah, TSLA is the way to go. Don't think about it too much, just do it. You won't regret it.\n\nHODL on",

    "title": "Insider Trading Weekly Update #018: Sales From $TSLA Execs, Largest Trades + Sector and Market Cap Overviews From The Past Week",
    "selftext": "GM,\n\nFirst, apologies for not getting a post out last week. I reached out to folks about the closed beta a little too hastily and got sentenced to a 3-day timeout. Won\u2019t happen again!\n\n**Onto the TL;DR** \\- Pretty quiet on the buying front, but selling continues! To start below are all $TSLA sales from executives in the past two weeks:\n\n* **December 12th:** Elon sold $3.58B, owns 423,622,432 shares\n* **December 6th:** Andrew Baglino (SVP) sold $233K (-2%), owns 64,259 shares\n* **December 6th:** Taneja Vaibhav (Chief Accounting Officer) sold $670K, owns 95,785 shares\n* **December 5/6th:** Zachary Kirkhorn (**CFO**) sold \\~$2.1M (-4.9%), owns 181,526 shares\n\n**Flagging some notable buys:** \n\n* The CFO of Six Flags ($SIX) purchased $161K, though, in my opinion, that is a low bet size\n* There were also several purchases from 10% owners of Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY), Duolingo, ($DUOL), and Dyne Therapeutics ($DYN)\n* Ignoring the buy from Riley Bryant of B. Riley Financial since it looks like their company from the name and to me, that is already sketchy\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases decreased from $213.7M to $95M (-56%)\n* Sales increased from $4.1B to $7.1B (+73%)\n* Transactions increased from 601 to 811 (+35%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 371 to 444 (+20%)\n   * Net buyers decreased from 71 to 60 (-15%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 300 to 384 (+28%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 505 to 716 (+42%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 83 to 101 (+9%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 412 to 615 (+49%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **December 12th - December 16th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.\n2. **Indirect** transactions are now included in the reports.\n3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 5th - December 9th.**\n4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).\n5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.\n\n# Further Context\n\n1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\\*if\\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.\n3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)\n\n# The Form Fore Closed Beta is *Live*\n\nForm Fore is currently running a closed beta with the public workbooks. You would have access to all Form 4 data and new features. There are still a few slots left. **Message me if you are interested.**\n\n# 1.

At 11:00 Eastern today I closed out all my puts and shorts and I started to accumulate JAN calls.  I continued buying through 14:00 and into the close. I plan to buy more tomorrow.\n\nHere is my chart. Yes, I'm actually autistic. Don't make fun. Just buy calls.\n\n[Stonks.](https://preview.redd.it/ssdayz1z4j7a1.png?width=925&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e8f9327612dc0594681435700771219be479b4)\n\nWhy did I flip long? \"Why does a bear become a bull?\" you're wondering? WHYY??  \nBecause Jim Cramer opened his stupid mouth and starting saying negative things on the name. Don't DM him. Don't @ him. Just remember to always inverse Cramer. \n\nThere's other reasons why I'm long now, mostly technically based. Weekly RSI being overextended to the downside, etc etc. This is not a pie in the sky, new ATH play on TSLA. I'm not looking to make 100K on this trade. My target range is anywhere from 140 to 156 / 164, depending on what we see in the price action. if we start to look weak again, I'll short again. If Elon keeps acting regarded, by EOY 2023 TSLA could see a price as low as $66 / share. I'll be there for it, shorting all the way down. I'm not a bear or a bull. I don't give a fuck about EV's. I don't need the market. The market needs me.\n\nThis just in:   \nElon opened his mouth on twitter just now, and for the first time all year, it looks to have helped TSLA. We'll see if that aftermarket bump holds when the market opens tomorrow. If it goes down, I will buy more calls and shares. If it goes up, I will chase it up and buy calls and shares.\n\nKeep in mind more inflation numbers are coming out tomorrow. Based on the broader market volatility, anything could happen. But TSLA could implode to $0 and I would give 0 fucks. I would give negative fucks. Because I am not an Elon cultist. I don't need this money. The money needs me.\n\nProof:\n\n[Calls.](https://preview.redd.it/484p1wo93j7a1.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d7ba2326ee31886e129a02dea7b13d5829d4b12)",

But there hasn't been bull capitulation yet and when stocks like $AAPL are barely getting a haircut...that doesn't mean Apple is amazing... because they're not. It means the market has a lot lower to go. \n\nRates are NOT going down in 2023 so you can kiss the secular bull market goodbye. The risk free rate is increasing and whether or not we have a recession is irrelevant because inflation is still above the target of 2%. A recession will be good for inflation but it won't necessitate rate cuts. \n\nWhy do I hate Apple? They have 16 BILLION shares outstanding and it's still trading with a market cap of 2T...this is categorically ABSURD.\n\nThe ONLY reason why $AAPL has been trading higher is the same reason why $TSLA is still insanely overvalued...a lot of stupid people are buying and holding it...just because.\n\nYou can't justify Apple's valuation here any more than the bulls could justify $SPY at $480 in January 2022.\n\nI'll stop being a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b when Apple falls back down to earth.

    "selftext": "1. Elon musk bought twitter. Obviously nobody uses Twitter and most accounts are bots. $0 valuation in my part and he\u2019s going to have to pay with tesla shares\n\n2. Teslas are overrated. Even though a lot of my friends still are holding their orders for tax credits next year (and inventory cleared up with the recent $7.5k sale + 10k supercharger miles) I still think they will cancel their order especially since the Kia EV and BMW EV looks nice.\n\n3. Supercharger network - I don\u2019t know too much about this but this sounds too good to be true. NO WAY you can charge 1k miles per hour without going close to causing your car to EXPLODE.\n\n4. FSD beta. Like Dan O\u2019 Dowd is trying to tell you. FSD beta is garbage. Saw his page on the newspaper. Dangerous!!!\n\n5. Batteries - I heard something about child labor mining cobalt. Sounds bad\n\n6. Tunnels - sounds great, but is it even possible?\n\n7. Oil companies - do you really think the world will run out of oil. Also who really cares about the future generations\n\n8. We hate Elon - he\u2019s autistic and they tend to be really blunt. He hurts my feelings\n\n9. Teslas catch on fire!!! Even though gas cars catch on fire nearly everyday and have combustion chambers to explode, are they ever on the news? No! And the media runs the world. \n\nWith these 9 reasons, I want to short TSLA. I\u2019m not sure how to short but trying to figure it out. This is not financial advise.",

The nearest mid-long terms support is around $110.\n\nMy point is that if you short TSLA at $123 with a stop loss of $200 and a risk of $77 for a gain of $13, the trade is obviously not cost effective.\n\nSome people may disagree with my opinion and will say that $110 is only theoretical support and support can be broken.\n\nOn a longer-term basis, I believe TSLA will fall below $100 next year, but after a short term sharp drop, there is no likelihood of a continued sharp drop here. Traders are rational and if it drops to $110, there will be traders to try to long.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8i6jck9j78a1.png?width=1763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=074acc87b6ab002064c681ce9443415e0f993150\n\nThis is my prediction of the future TSLA trend. Rome was not built in a day, and TSLA will not fall below 100 in one breath. So now is not a good time to short Tesla, you can wait for TSLA to rebound and then short it at higher levels.",

While you might say 3-5% can be had risk free from a treasury, that 3-5% could be realized much quicker if TSLA stabilizes or bounces. If TSLA gets a nice bounce, you could probably take 2-3% very quickly and close the position. If TSLA stops dropping, the premium could also quickly evaporate.  \n\nLook at it this way: You're either buying a stock you love at a price that would be like 99% lower than what you've been paying the last 24 months while you had a hard-on for it, or you just pull a few percent in premiums a lot sooner than 12 months.",

However, legacy car makers like Ford and Chevy have since started to ramp up EV and Hybrid car production eating into TSLA market share. Non-TSLA charging stations have also increased over the past two years in response to increased demand.\n\nThe elephant in the room is also undoubtedly Twitter, no matter how you slice it, unless Twitter makes a MASSIVE multi billion dollar turn they are going to no be able to pay their debts. How does this effect TSLA though, didn\u2019t Elon buy it with his own money? No, Elon took out a multi billion dollar margin loan that is the largest of its kind in history using his TSLA shares as collateral. Elon will be forced to sell no matter what he says he\u2019ll do the creditors will demand their money so long as TSLA continues to plummet into the dirt.\n\nMoral of the story, get off the copium when it comes to TSLA stock, they may not go to zero but sub 100 is not off the table by any stretch",

    "selftext": "Investors betting against Tesla Inc. are getting the big bonanza they have been waiting for, with the electric-vehicle maker set to record its worst annual performance on record.\n\nShort sellers in the company \u2014 or bearish investors who stand to gain when an asset\u2019s price falls \u2014 are poised to reap mark-to-market profits of about $17 billion, making Tesla the most profitable short trade of the year, data from S3 Partners shows.\n\nTesla has tumbled more than 42% in December alone, driving it to a loss of 68% this year \u2014 marking a radical about face for a stock that surged during the low-rate era of the pandemic.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare victory for the shorts, whose 89% return comes after several years of significant losses, S3\u2019s Ihor Dusaniwsky said. About 2.9% of Tesla\u2019s free float is held short, according to S3 data.\n\nTesla has faced a tumultuous year, with investors fleeing risk assets over concerns about geopolitical uncertainty, high inflation, rising interest rates and a possible recession. Add to that worries that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s focus will be diverted to his recently acquired social-media company, Twitter, just as demand for electric vehicles is set to take a hit.\n\nDusaniwsky expects short selling to persist until the stock reaches a bottom. But analysts and investors are still struggling to see a bottom, especially as the company is due to report fourth-quarter delivery numbers early next month and has been offering large buyer incentives.\n\nTesla shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading on Thursday.\n\nEven if share price begins to recover, its notorious volatility could continue to linger, according to S3\u2019s Dusaniwsky.\n\n\u201cWhen Tesla\u2019s stock begins to tick upwards, there should be a flurry of short covering which will help boost its stock price higher and quicker as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-29/tesla-s-worst-ever-year-brings-17-billion-windfall-for-shorts?srnd=markets-vp#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-29/tesla-s-worst-ever-year-brings-17-billion-windfall-for-shorts?srnd=markets-vp#xj4y7vzkg)\n\nTesla (TSLA) short sellers and bearish investors are poised to profit of about 17 billion, making it the most profitable short trade of the year according to S3 Partners, as the EV giant is set to record its worst year ever.

    "selftext": "After shares of Tesla dipped by more than 10% on Tuesday deepening a year-long selloff, CEO Elon Musk told employees not to be \u201ctoo bothered by stock market craziness.\u201d\n\nMusk circulated the comments on Wednesday in a companywide email, which CNBC obtained. He told staffers that Tesla needs to \u201cdemonstrate continued excellent performance,\u201d and that \u201clong-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!\u201d\n\nElectric vehicle blog Electrek reported earlier on the email.\n\nTesla shares have declined about 68% for the year, though they rose 3.3% on Wednesday to $112.71. The stock is down 42% in December, and is poised to close out its worst month, quarter and year on record.\n\nMusk has blamed Tesla\u2019s declining share price in part on rising interest rates. But critics point to his Twitter takeover as a bigger culprit for the slide, which has wiped out about $675 billion in market cap this year as of Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\nIn the email, Musk thanked Tesla employees for their work in 2022, encouraged them to push hard for a strong fourth-quarter finish, and asked them to \u201cvolunteer to help deliver\u201d cars to customers before midnight on Dec. 31, if at all possible.\n\nDuring the last days of most quarters, Tesla enlists employees from all over the company to bring new cars to customers in order to hit or exceed stated delivery goals, work that in normal times is limited to people on the sales and delivery teams. The company has been aiming for 50% year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries but has cautioned investors it may not meet that target every year.\n\nMusk\u2019s attention has been focused on Twitter of late. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO sold tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in his electric vehicle company in 2022 to finance the $44 billion buyout of the social media company.\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/elon-musk-tells-tesla-employees-to-ignore-stock-market-craziness.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/elon-musk-tells-tesla-employees-to-ignore-stock-market-craziness.html)\n\nElon Musk has told Tesla (TSLA) employees \"don\u2019t be \u2018bothered by stock market craziness.\" TSLA is down 68% YTD and poised to close out its worst month as the stock is down 42% this month alone.

    "title": "How WSB Can Make Money in the 2023 Bear Market.",
    "selftext": "**Please read this entire post, everything is important here!!!**\n\nSo usually wallstreetbets will find a meme stock and then we all load up on calls and buy shares, shorts have to cover, and then the stock price rockets.  \n\nI know people will get upset when I say this, but most of the price increase is caused by a gamma squeeze and not shorts covering.\n\nNow, because easy money is gone in the markets it is tough to find a stock that can run from shorts covering and a gamma squeeze. **This is where the genius idea comes in.**  Because of the way that the options market works we can: instead of pushing the price of stocks up... send them right into the ground.\n\n**Let me explain:**\n\nTypically when everyone on WSB loads up on calls for a meme stock, market makers who sold you those call contracts try to remain delta neutral (they only make money through the spread of the bid/ask of the contracts).  When the stock price increases the calls that everyone bought become closer to ITM which increases the delta, and because of this the market maker is forced to buy more shares to remain delta neutral.  Which then increases the price more, so they have to buy more and more shares pretty much.  This is what causes that huge exponential run-up we see at the top of meme stocks.\n\n**We can make money the other way:**\n\nInstead of looking for a stock that has way too many people stuck in short positions, buy calls, force them to cover, and profit.  We can do the exact opposite. *Look for a stock that has way too many people stuck in long positions, buy puts, force them to sell, and profit.* \n\nInverse gamma squeezes work the same way here, market makers who sell us the put contracts will want to remain delta neutral so they will sell shares.  When the puts become closer to ITM the market maker will have to sell more shares to remain delta neutral.  This then pushes the price down and they have to sell more and more shares.  It will cause an exponential move downward.\n\nThe most recent stock this has happened to is Tesla.  Way too many people were leveraged on long positions and when speculators started loading up on puts the stock went into a freefall. \n\n[$TSLA 2 Hour Chart](https://preview.redd.it/obkf2nxhd29a1.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a859cdf8820b196d944d8beb43a92338301c3b)\n\nThis stock was at a 700 Billion market cap, and fell almost 50% in one month, that is insane.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cem Karsan](https://preview.redd.it/ix3f0y3ie29a1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6848298768d8912bd82a5f74c391731ebc206bad)\n\nThis guy has worked in quant funds and market making for over 20 years, he knows his stuff and way more than anyone in this sub. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cem Karsan](https://preview.redd.it/tfrug5vxe29a1.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f860ed8f9694b47ac9230ac8dfaafb40a1b5cded)\n\nHe knows that the majority of the recent decrease in Tesla's share price has been caused by an unusual amount of speculators loading up on put contracts.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion / TLDR:** \n\nInstead of looking for good companies that are over-shorted and then we load on calls... We look for poop companies that are over-longed and then load on puts. \n\n[To the moon for 2023, when we load on puts](https://preview.redd.it/fqy89b8jf29a1.png?width=509&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba9b627bed35c6be573edeeba6e0539358d9b4f)\n\n**Please read this entire post, everything is important here!!!**",
