    "selftext": " \n\nGlobal Macro\n\nU.S. bond yields hit another record high, U.S. stock index futures lower\n\nAt the start of the Asian session on Tuesday, the 10-year U.S. bond yield quickly rose above the 1.81% mark early in the session, the highest level since January 2020. 2-year U.S. bond yields also broke through 1% for the first time since February 2020. At press time, U.S. stock futures were lower, with the Nasdaq futures down 1.44%, the S&amp;P 500 futures down 0.87% and the Dow futures down 0.69%.\n\nGoldman Sachs, \"Flag Bearer of the Commodity Bull Market,\" Remains Steadfast in its Bullish View for a Decade\n\nJeff Currie, head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, discusses some of the key themes that could shape commodity prices in the coming decades, and once again reiterates his view that he has been bullish on commodities markets for the past year. Not long ago, the bank reportedly said it was \"extremely bullish\" on commodities and sees a possible decade-long supercycle.\n\nDanske Bank: Fed expected to raise rates 4 times this year, start tapering in September\n\nIf the U.S. economy develops in line with expectations, the Fed may raise interest rates for the first time in March, supported by a tight labor market and still-high inflation. The number of Fed rate hikes this year is expected to increase from three to four (in March, June, September and December, respectively), with each hike of 25 basis points. In addition, it is expected to start tapering in September. Given the strong economy and higher underlying inflation, we believe the risk of tightening tends to increase rather than decrease.\n\nBank of America Survey: Investors reduce net position in technology sector to lowest level since December 2008\n\nBank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey for January showed that fund managers' net allocations to the technology sector fell 20% sequentially to 1%, the lowest level since 2008. They expect inflation levels to fall this year and are betting on a record overall boom in commodities and equities. In addition, a monthly survey conducted by Deutsche Bank found that most respondents believe U.S. technology stocks are in a bubble, as investors remain very pessimistic about the Fed's hawkish turn and rising U.S. bond yields.\n\nHot News\n\nStar Tech Stocks Weak in Pre-Market, Nvidia, Tesla Down More Than 2%\n\nAs of writing, $Nvidia ([NVDA.US](https://nvda.us/))$ and $Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ are down over 2% premarket, while $Meta Platforms ([FB.US](https://fb.us/))$, $Amazon ([AMZN.US](https://amzn.us/))$, $Microsoft ([MSFT.US](https://msft.us/))$, $Apple ([AAPL.US](https://aapl.us/))$ and $Google-A ([GOOGL.US](https://googl.us/))$ are down over 1%.\n\nAnti-epidemic stocks lower in pre-market, BioNTech down more than 6%\n\nAs of press time, $BioNTech ([BNTX.US](https://bntx.us/))$ is down over 6% premarket, $Moderna ([MRNA.US](https://mrna.us/))$, $Novavax Pharmaceuticals ([NVAX.US](https://nvax.us/))$, $Ocugen ([OCGN.US](https://ocgn.us/))$ are down over 3%, and $Pfizer ([PFE.US](https://pfe.us/))$ is down nearly 1%.\n\nGoldman Sachs$ Q4 net revenue of $12.64 billion, down more than 4% pre-market\n\n$ Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://gs.us/))$ reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $12.64 billion, fourth-quarter investment banking revenue of $3.6 billion, fourth-quarter trading revenue of $3.99 billion, fourth-quarter equity sales and trading revenue of $2.12 billion, and fourth-quarter fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities sales and trading revenue of $1.86 billion.

Pindo said, because the page display percentage digit is limited, so they put a percentage with at least 6 digits or more after the decimal point, omitted to show as 0.9%, the 0.9% shown on the bargain page is not 0.9%, but 0.9996427%. For the lawyer invited more than one person to chop but the chopping progress bar did not change, Tang Jiangrong, senior director of Poundland's legal department, explained: \"Because some of the free chopped goods amount is large, pulling a small number of users to chop off the amount is not enough to make the percentage change, it will make consumers think that the chopping price has not changed.\n\nAzure's U.S. subsidiary is reported to have recently signed a ten-year lease for an office building in San Jose, California, doubling the footprint of its headquarters compared to the current one, with nearly 18,580 square meters of office space after the expansion.

The price of the deal has not yet been announced.\n\nApple's self-developed next-generation A16 application processor has been designed and finalized, and will be cast using TSMC's 4nm N4P process, and is expected to enter mass production at TSMC's Fab18 facility starting in the second half of the year.

    "selftext": "Please take this post with a HUGE grain of salt. I am not saying we are going to go down in a straight line. We will likely bounce here and there but yes, I am calling a  major correction/recession.\n\nSpent 2 hours on this to show how fked we are - rates may be eyeballed as I referenced bar graphs\n\n**TLDR: Fed's basically BRRRR'd and left the overnight/interest rates at rock bottom lows (opps?) creating the biggest asset bubble we have ever seen in the entire history of mankind and mind-numbing inflation.**\n\n[SPY monthly chart - with commentary](https://invst.ly/x6shz)\n\n[SPY monthly - 1974 - Jan 2022 \\(48 years\\)](https://preview.redd.it/j80ngysj5dd81.jpg?width=1858&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc040dd32a9b4ee7b5ef6730f0f24fb09cdf550)\n\nEV bubble:  TSLA and EV is probably the biggest bubble from what I can tell and Elon managed to sell the top. EV cars is like gas cars back then but never commanded a huge P/E. Cars are utility, goes A-B. When people see through that self driving tech is a decade away (prob due to city infrastructure to support self-driving and political red tape \\[nobody is rushing to have a self-driving car\\]), we can see some downside or relatively flatness or bearish on it.\n\nReal estate - bubble.... everywhere... Cheap money borrowed from the Feds. Canada's YOY RE prices has gone up 27%. There is no supply issue because we had this supply issue pre-pandemic but we never popped 27% in a single year or even close to it. People are balls deep in mortgage payments, and those who got in late is even more screwed.\n\nmetaVerse - a pandemic by product - too early to tell how to monetize this space. You can tell companies have been doing this, CS GO - skins, Diablo 3 - marketplace. These have not taken off in any dramatic way so we can gauge consumer sentiment to spend money in a virtual reality.\n\nAI innovations- this would be deflation.\n\nSPY top holdings are BIG TECH. Big tech was the major theme of the pandemic hedge which ended up being great winners. Re-opening is a negative for all these companies and the pandemic is basically over after this year.\n\nThe thing trading at 35k right now. This that have no value, is speculation. Speculation ends up being a bubble. EVEN if this thing is the next best thing, we are too early. All this cheap money finding new ideas to generate an ungodly P/L is basically, a matter bubble.\n\nWarren Buffett - ATH cash holdings. Going to wait out for the market to kick out the froth.\n\nChina - Imposing tons of new regulations to soften their markets, whether it be RE market (tax on developers), big tech (listing and fines, all regulations), ensuring the COMMON prosperity can continue (most China markets are/were already inflated before this initiative was introduced). China is basically a step ahead of the US Feds in controlling their economic cycles.\n\nRead this, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp), then reflect on life around you, then read it again.

Now is the time to be buying. Netflix drops from the 600s to the 300s and you don't buy. Tesla enters the 700s and you don't buy. Amd went under 100 and you didn't buy.\n\nDude stop telling me the market is rigged. You're just too scared to buy and hold onto anything. Just don't buy garbage companies like wish and you'll be fine. \n\nThe problem is you guys feel this illogical need to own stocks that will like 2x expectations every quarter, which leads to these insane swings like FB and Netflix. In the real world, not every quarter and not every year is a home run. I think a lot of companies are on sale. I think a lot will bounce back. And I think a lot of you are about to miss the coming bull run over the next few months because you have paper hands like Meet Klevin.\n\nEdit:\n\nMy positions include basically all shares. I have AMD, NVDA, GOOG, NNDM (very small position), SPXL, and I have 4 SPY $500 Calls for June. I consider the only \"bet\" I am making to be the calls and possibly the NNDM. Aside from that, I can just forget about my portfolio for 5 years and know it's going to be up. I did a lot of my buying within the past few trading days. I am holding.",

    "selftext": "Position: NVDA $265x10 Call Feb18\n\nEarnings date: Feb 16 \n\nAlright, here's a play even the most dim witted of you can follow. If any of you have been paying any attention to the GPU and graphics cards market you'd have realized one thing by now. You're shit out of luck if you want to buy a graphics card in the current market - they've been sold out for quite a while now and if you want to buy 1 then be ready to shell out $3k-$4k.. There's even a Japanese retailer selling these babies, the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500. That's right, let that sink in. These bad boys are selling for 3x the MSRP and NVIDIA is set to launch the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, you guessed it, right before earnings. Source:[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/european-pricing-emerges-rtx-3090-ti](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/european-pricing-emerges-rtx-3090-ti)\n\nMoreover, there had been a severe shortage of GPUs and graphics cards over the past year thanks to the Zuck buying a bunch from NVIDIA for his little VR porn project. Coupled with the fact that virgin gamers around the world are ravenous to get their hands on one of these bad boys when the new lot is out guarantees it will be sold out instantly. \n\nDon't believe me? Okay believe the smart money then: One of the world\u2019s largest public pensions by assets made major changes in its investments in large-cap tech stocks as 2021 came to a close. PGGM of Zeist, Netherlands, cut investments in [Apple ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/aapl),  [Intel](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/intc)(INTC), and [Qualcomm ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/qcom)(QCOM) stock in the fourth quarter, and initiated a position in [Nvidia ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/nvda)(NVDA) stock. \n\nSource: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-intel-qualcomm-nvidia-51643844523?mod=bar\\_RHF](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-intel-qualcomm-nvidia-51643844523?mod=bar_RHF)\n\nI would like to end this by saying this is the real world and although NVDA has beat expected earnings 5 years in a row, anything can happen and I do not want to be responsible for any of you having to drink your piss to survive, but if there was a play to bet the house on, this would be it.\n\nEdit: up 250% since when I first bought in!!

    "selftext": "**Week 6 Earnings Plays Analysis and Historical Post Earnings Moves Compilation - $NVDA, $ROKU, $PLTR, $RBLX, $UPST, $DASH, $ABNB, and More**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey Bull Gang, hope you all banked last week! Both $CHGG and $CLF played out as expected, allowing us to profit handsomely. Volatility remains elevated this week due to the looming fed meeting combined with Russia\u2019s potential invasion, meaning we\u2019ll need to be quick on our toes whenever we decide to make a trade. Don\u2019t get caught offside and don\u2019t get greedy! There will be weeks which allow us to make safer money. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUPiE_8Z8-SO0Q20R0JKKILgYP97pI62CtlNW_biM3M/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUPiE_8Z8-SO0Q20R0JKKILgYP97pI62CtlNW_biM3M/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$SHOP has made a positive move post earnings around 70% of the time.** Across the past 26 quarters, Shopify has gone green in 18 of them. I\u2019m not saying that a beat is guaranteed or that profit is inevitable, but the odds are in your favor if you go long. The best way to play this would be to sell an ATM bullish credit spread, as that would net you the greatest return most consistently in this case. If you run binary long calls, you\u2019d need a large move to break even and make profits, while with a bullish credit spread, you would just need ANY green move to realize max gains. If you plan on running this play, keep in mind that past performances aren\u2019t indicative of future results.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$FVRR is extremely mispriced.** At the time of writing, $FVRR has an implied move of 18%, yet historically $FVRR only moves 8.5% post earnings. To make matters even more favorable, $FVRR has only moved more than 18% once since it\u2019s inception, meaning this trade is extremely safe. We can sell straddles or strangles on $FVRR to capture some amazing premiums, and capitalize on the IV crush that will occur the following day. Those afraid of the theoretical infinite loss can look to sell iron condors or credit spreads instead. For more information on pricing inefficiencies, check out this [article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **This week has every reason to be volatile.** We\u2019ve got Consumer Inflation Expectations alongside an Emergency Fed Meeting on Monday, PPI and API Crude Oil Stock Change on Tuesday, Retail Sales, Bond Auction, FOMC Minutes, and a potential invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday, and a boatload of Fed members speaking Thursday and Friday. This is not a week to play the hero, nor is it a week to play with large position sizes. Preserve your capital at all costs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nStay safe out there everyone - Volatility is high this week, and for good reason! That being said, use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUPiE_8Z8-SO0Q20R0JKKILgYP97pI62CtlNW_biM3M/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you\u2019d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading!**",

    "selftext": "Back in mid December 2021 after the fed meeting the market had a rally, all my heavey tech based positions (all in blue chip tech, with no investments in ballooned uniform companies) recovered from the minor dip of November caused by omicron, from the meeting my takeaway was that the market will get oversold early 2022. I\u2019ve then asked advice from a friend a trust with over 30 years of trading and his feedback was that worse case scenario is a 10-15% correction early 2022. I really wanted to liquidate and sit on cash to buy the real dip and avoid loosing my 20% gain from 2021. In the matter of 2 weeks early January I lost that 20% gain and lost 15% of my overall portfolio, out of dispersion I liquidated 30% of my overall positions and started betting on semis( due to the shortages a real opportunity is here) prior to their earnings with the 30% of my overall portfolio, this then did not go as planned and here\u2019s how it went. \n\nASML: lost 3 % on the 30% which is roughly 1.5% gain of overall portfolio\nAMD: Made 13% on 20% of overall portfolio, roughly 2.5% \nGOOG: thought would have a solid quarter so 10% of portfolio was invested sold at 9% uptrend with .9% gain \nFB: with 13.5 % of overall portfolio invested through buying its dips took a hit at earnings, devastating to my overall portfolio with a 6% net loss on overall portfolio. \nQCOMM: invested 10% of portfolio and lost 2% post earnings. \n\nHere\u2019s where shit starts ( continued on earnings plays ) \n\nI shorted Zillow and it rallied.. (shorted more at peak of rally) \nbought CLF and it tanked..\n\nNext moves: \n\nNVDA 30% of overall portfolio\n\nThis is not financial advice, but to get insight from fellas who want to make money. \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019ll try to reply to all serious comments and will ignore shit posts",

This \u2018high demand\u2019 that they are facing could just be apparent relative to the supply. If NVDA could make all the cards to meet the demand, they would  likely attempt to do so (unless they are artificially deflating supply on purpose). This GPU shortage is nothing new and has been going on for a while. The fact that there is still a lingering high demand could mean that it\u2019s not purely high demand and it could be due to a shortage.\n\nInvestors are expecting NVDA to keep growing. If they aren\u2019t showing that they are making progress to combat towards the shortage, this could be bad news for NVDA bulls.\n\nYes I know there is much more to NVDA than just the GPUs, I just want to make sure that the people who are betting on them to crush earnings because of GPUs should at least contemplate this info.\n\nNVDAs earnings could go either way, make sure you\u2019re prepared for that in your trading strategy.",

Yours truly, TheAssExtracter, who has lost 97% of their portfolio and is hanging on by a dick hair, has desperately done several days worth of DD that I would like to share with you. Surely, my market hypothesis will benefit a lot of you. \n\nBiden has been rambling about how Russia plans to manufacture a pretext for war, making the invasion imminent. What if all this media/propaganda is actually manufacturing the pretext for the US to get involved. \u2026. Genius. Tricky democratic president wanting to stick his limp, shriveled vegan penis into a hot, exotic Russian babe. This will of course tank the market and you should buy puts. Combined with JP talking again in March, recession will happen, but it won\u2019t come to pass. \n\nTbh, I sympathize with Russia, they are the victims. All they want is for Ukraine to be neutral, so they don\u2019t have to be neighbors with a NATO ally, who will slowly finger their tight Russian butthole. Meanwhile, Ukraine herself will literally receive a colonoscopy in the form of a German pipe. \n\nReally, alpha Putin has a big red button (200k troops), and pushing it causes US investor panic. He can do this indefinitely, until Ukraine bends the knee. My thought is that the Russian invasion has already been priced in (after hours on Friday, and throughout last week). So buying puts at this point is a trap. \n\nWhy is Russia threatening to invade now, of all times? Inflation. Timing is everything. The truth is that alpha Putin sees the inflation weakness of the US and wants to add pressure, basically shorting the US into a panic-induced recession. Once Biden successfully manages to finally swallow his viagra by lubing it with overpriced oil, he will become hard enough again to push against Russia. Ukraine will not join NATO yet, and Russia will agree to postpone so they don\u2019t face sanctions. They will pull another stunt when the time is right, maybe elections. \n\nIf an invasion were to happen, if you were in alpha Putin\u2019s place, many would agree to save this move for a Republican leadership in America, as they don\u2019t give a fuck about Ukraine. Tbh, no average American really gives a fuck about Ukraine. I expect a market bounce next week, as tensions relieve and peace gets priced in. Maybe this is my trauma from NVDA earnings speaking, retard learning that everything is priced in and that the market is illogical, and so we should think without logic.  \n\nSo, given this dissertation, we should all buy CALLS next week, and sell puts at market open (I doubled my money on DASH puts).",

    "title": "Show Me The Flaw In This Perfect Strategy",
    "selftext": "Alright, my dealy regarded. I'm pretty uneducated, and I've been working on a strategy that can \"guarantee\" returns. I know there's no guarantees in the market, or everyone would do it, so I need someone smarter than me \\[so basically anyone\\] to show me the flaw in this approach. I'm gonna use current numbers even though it's weekend, so just play along.\n\nI buy 100 shares of NVDA for $232. I then sell a NVDA $225C for $15.20. This means, if my shares get called away, my $23,200 investment just netted me \\~$800, or 3.4% return. However, I'm scared of the market right now, so I also buy a NVDA $225P for $3.90, bring my profit upon shares getting called away to $410, or \\~1.7%. Help me see the scenarios were I make less than \\~1.7% on this position.\n\nIf the shares DON'T get called away, so NVDA drops to or below $252, my break even price on the shares is $216.8, at which point I will have made no money on the premium. Anything below that will start to be a loss on the trade. However, if we go the insurance route, that put is now worth at least $8.20, which is over a 100% gain on the put.\n\nFurthermore, I'm doing this on margin. So I can actually buy 200 shares of NVDA for that \"same\" cash balance of $23,200, which essentially doubles the % return in both scenarios. My mindset is that during the current uncertainty, I'd always play with insurance on hand, but once we get back to some sort of predictability or baseline with these stocks, I think the insurance can be foregone if the trader \\[ME\\] is willing to hold shares a bit and continue to sell calls against them at any price between cost basis and original strike price.\n\nAfter typing this up, I see this wouldn't work on a stock where the puts are more expensive than the calls, but I wonder if there's just a reverse scenario where you can do this, most likely not with margin, since I think it would instead require selling puts as the basis.",

    "selftext": "I am the born optimist. I believe in investing for the long term and i will keep doing so.\n\nBut I can't be totally blind to reality: growing inflation, growing interest rates, a war in Europe, and an energy cost shock coming on us. We are likely in for a quarter or two of negative growth. If the war goes on for longer, it might well be more.\n\nI can't imagine this will not impact the markets, particularly as I am heavily invested in more volatile shares (TSLA, NVDA, AMD, QQQ, AMZN, GOOGL to name a few). I also have a Lombard account, which is on the safe side for now, but you never know how things go.\n\nI have made some (limited) adjustments to my portfolio meant to reduce my Lombard. I am now in a situation where I would risk a margin call only if things were to go massively tits up (as in, say,: Nasdaq minus 60% or 70%, or a combination of Nasdaq minus 50% and S&amp;P minus 50%). I am using this as a proxy of general shares decline, if the indices go down badly there's is no way TSLA or NVDA will escape the carnage, though they might fare... less badly (or not, as the case may be).\n\nI know this is, realistically, unlikely, which is why I sleep at night. But I would like to know what your opinions are on a slow, steady, protracted decline like the one in the years 1929 to 1931 (which was way more brutal than the October 1929 crash). I am particularly interested in the risk approach of those who already have a Lombard account and must, I think, make the same considerations I am making.\n\nThanks to all retards in advance",

    "title": "NVDA hypepost",
    "selftext": "I've been holding NVDA stock since 2016 with not a single share sold. I've never been more convinced of the holding and I've always tried to have a realistic, humble view on my gains with it and the company's prospects and risks. But at this point I'm unironically thinking it can compete for #1. Yes, I'm talking **most valuable company on earth in terms of market cap**. The only real competition I see for that could be TSLA fairy retard magic. Other companies above it simply arent growing fast enough to compete. Reasons:\n\nTheir gaming business just keeps serving as a rock solid foundation, it's considered to be their dinosaur business yet it's growing at rapid rates. They had 37% YoY revenue growth with gaming even though there were no major product launches since Fall 2020. It's a proven cash cow to fund completely unrelated projects. Customers have proven that they'll pay anything for a NVDA gpu and I think it's sustainable. Work from home is here to stay and when you spend that much time with your own machine, you want it to be a good one.\n\nData center is up 71% YoY and they just delivered on the H100, securing another 2 years of extreme data center growth with insane margins. Data center will soon overshadow gaming significantly, especially with them being on track with the Grace CPU. Their vision is to deliver the full stack and they're getting close to doing that. One can only imagine what their data center numbers will be 5 years from now. It could be in the medium to high double digit billions of yearly revenue.\n\n[Data center has been chasing gaming revenue and it's set to blast ahead.](https://preview.redd.it/9jb27l21uip81.png?width=2059&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6942f773e6f2f670f0b9f2478d240bbefe098ee1)\n\nNVDA has $11B of automotive revenue in the pipeline and that's just the early innings of that market. They're making smart acquisitions to grow it and are saying it's a $300B TAM. If they capture 10% of that that's going to be already a significant contributor to overall revenue. The analyst models will go wild when automotive revenue starts picking up. You may ditch a high end computer after 5 years but you're not ditching a car after 5 years. The long term opportunity from software services for cars is insane and NVDA is investing heavily into software while delivering the chips also. A car is not a car anymore, it's a computer that happens to be a car and a computer needs uptates. Even if they were to go through rough times which every company does every now and then, they will be cashing in on software services from cars sold 10 to 15 years ago.\n\nAnd on top of that they're going all in on Omniverse. When they announced Omniverse 1 year ago it seemed like a neat little side thing, now it's all over their presentations, they're painting it as a key component to their whole business. Within just one year they went from \"Hey look, we just made this!\" to integrating it as a core part of their AI business.\n\n[Look at this slide and see how many products are already connected with Omniverse.](https://preview.redd.it/aa9fd43ltip81.png?width=1990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2470754161f809d9372adb7a26c0279cfa972aa)\n\nI'm telling you they're seeing something with Omniverse not everyone is ready to see yet. It's pretty obvious when you look at their videos and slides but it's easy to put off as dreaming. And yes, it's too hard to quantify the opportunity yet. NVDA is saying the Omniverse business has a TAM of $300B which is almost a third of their total claimed TAM of $1T. Anything can happen with it. If it takes off seriously NVDA will have transformed as a business yet again and there's no competition in sight for this, they're years ahead. It's so valuable to be ahead in software and to be the first to market. Even if competition starts arising for simulation, everyone will already be used to Omniverse. Getting people to change software is HARD.\n\nI've never been this excited about NVDA. The future is now and they're ahead of everyone else. Their big investment in software is starting to pay off and will lead to margins never seen. To me it's not a question that the stock will see a market cap of $1T soon. I'm ready to believe that they may be going for the homerun, to be the most valuable company on earth. And even if they don't, at worst with the way they're going they'll still a very good company with respectable growth.",

Forecasting the rest of the year and seeing something I don\u2019t like, but maybe one of you is better informed?\n\nNVDA is selling between 25% and 57% of all graphics cards to cryptominers.  In August moves away from proof of work, meaning no more mining it.  This is to get rid of the energy usage to run the currency.  I\u2019ve been watching for 3 months and the amount of cards showing up on eBay is growing drastically and getting cheaper.  Miners are trying to cash out their cards before they take a big hit in value.  \n\nNVDA has enjoyed stock sellouts because of chip shortages and I feel mainly because of miners.  The cost of the highest end GPU\u2019s has almost tripled because of this demand.  NVDA has been trying to ramp production to capitalize and sounds like q2 and q3 they will pump out record stock at record prices.  \n\nIs there an issue if literally 10\u2019s of thousands of the top cards are liquidated on the used market, for next to nothing, more and more heading into August (cards used for mining lose a lot of value).  Right when NVDA is losing their biggest customer (miners) and releasing a new expensive card in huge quantities.\n\n\nTLDR; Possibly the entire market may be swamped by a glut of cheap second hand (top of the line) cards and expensive new cards this Summer.

    "selftext": "  \n\nThe day before CPI\u2026 the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. \n\nThe bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn\u2019t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hpw0uyrqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f\n\nWe actually established yet another downward channel today that I don\u2019t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzmwaslsqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li7lzt7tqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92\n\nWe are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. \n\nBut on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don\u2019t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk5l6gstqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d\n\nThe daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14m0bnhuqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136\n\nThe daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. \n\nChannel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don\u2019t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7xoaqpvqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b\n\nWeekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). \n\nAnother thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). \n\nWednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. \n\nThursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.\n\nThat is a massive amount of OI to the downside that\u2019s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. \n\nWith the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvve2nvwqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6cb5a86ef7f0a6606d8305928378625e0d55be0\n\nApple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. \n\nApple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. \n\nChannel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. \n\nI currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvihq1qxqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818\n\nThe blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. \n\nI am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h42lt6cyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c\n\nFord attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.\n\nFord also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don\u2019t suspect the RSI to be an issue. \n\nAgain took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26yjjyxyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e647a1487ff5cbb7889db0f47334e17a6429f2b\n\nQQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. \n\nChannel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. \n\nI also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qghek3jzqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50292337467bbf1fd1b3d55a377e4955d987401b\n\nThe VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dkbfa40rzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944\n\nWhen you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. \n\nOverall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. \n\nWhile some don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that\u2019s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",

    "selftext": "  \n\nWell the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps\u2026 \n\nWith the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it\u2019s the roaring 20s again\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhw0gco3ydt81.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bb99893e214393da1508cf0b3d7d9515131bead\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er1nkrc4ydt81.png?width=842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662e6b5c948726587f88547f0cba30df32f0f650\n\nToday was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours\u2026 its still a break and that\u2019s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7\n\nAs you can see our red bear channels broken\u2026 lets see if we can find a new trend or not\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace\n\nOverall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. \n\nYou may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked\u2026\n\nCurrent downward trend is presented as follow: Green \u00e0 red. Red. Red. \u00e0 green -&gt; red. Red \u00e0 green \u00e0 red red red \u00e0 green \u00e0 red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. \n\nToday is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9\n\nWe have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. \n\nTomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. \n\nToday was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. \n\nGoing into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:\n\n430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)\n\n435p 49k\n\n440p 77k\n\n450c 62k \n\n445 38k\n\nAs you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)\u2026 we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p\u2026 There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. \n\nJust out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k\u2026. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k\u2026 even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k\u2026 that\u2019s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3s9ml37ydt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caae03fb35e40ce7d87b6e44177c9523ad875915\n\nApple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. \n\nTodays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. \n\nThe interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663\n\nWith Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. \n\nApple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ec85a98ydt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6536fb69f982d3b1953e249887f471e25f9509e\n\nAMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis\u2026 a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again\u2026 definitely odd. \n\nInterestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. \n\nAMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gyfddp8ydt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38157a204b956632b698a1e2b2cf5100e80d564\n\nFord with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uv62879ydt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68d8dcb465098b551f8c4f7fb36d1f9d3bfd5bbc\n\nQQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. \n\nTomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lp9tapp9ydt81.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b08aaafc4107a52badba56b1940331f26be44c\n\nToday was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don\u2019t like to hold positions over night\u2026 \n\nThe 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. \n\nThe 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. \n\nAMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. \n\nFord still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. \n\nSPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there\u2026 but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.\n\nAgain all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nToday was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. \n\nWith that being said I made 4 trades today.\n\nOne 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)\n\nOne 1dte call for 10% \n\nOne 0dte put for 7% \n\nOne 0dte put for 8%. \n\nOverall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. \n\nToday was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. \n\nBut today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don\u2019t believe in what you are trading and you don\u2019t believe in the move that\u2019s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. \n\nDiscipline in trading is 100% crucial.",

    "selftext": "  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something\u2026 In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That\u2019s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cbff1k4flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c88e247274869141c67e29ea0f55e342e3a046bf\n\nTuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a \u201cnormal\u201d spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to \u201crest\u201d before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. \n\nHistorically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move\u2026 Spy dipping to 440.6 \u00e0 it involves a rest period\u2026 SPY breaking back above the 8ema\u2026 Spy breaking to 442.3 \u00e0 then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move\u2026 so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\\_\\_\\_-. \n\nMy point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6kk5555flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a29142cfd1fc794a4766fe400267a253eafb9f76\n\nThis mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx249ku5flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536a61250fbef3166d9bc55010541985bffb8c82\n\nI also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h7c2ne6flt81.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a846b916b4e8e867a1203b63d3b04a0eff9595\n\nI had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. \n\nBull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. \n\nBear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. \n\nWe have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   \n Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&amp;J\n\nWednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)\n\nThursday- more airlines, at&amp;t, SNAP\n\nFriday- nothing too notable\n\nSo the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fmnby77flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2231bd8a40a188a3ff7940aee0560dc908475c63\n\nApple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. \n\nBull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. \n\nBulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. \n\nBear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. \n\nToday I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvg7y9w7flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80c743f2529336a5252a6e5ec363ef449d3f2805\n\nAMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. \n\nThis will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. \n\nLooking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 \u00e0 $85 \u00e0 80 \u00e0 and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. \n\nFor the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet\u2026 some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h8w8sk8flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cad9975294ee40cd03342febaf5cb1275945383f\n\nSomeone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it\u2026 Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. \n\nI make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high\u2026 that\u2019s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aoul8wb9flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c127767a9d0855bea07795907eef9c5100b08de\n\nFord actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. \n\nI will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. \n\nFord is 40% of its 52 week high\u2026 Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. \n\nI will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/roawb1w9flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30d527874a2a3aac8f2450fb9959decfe350880\n\nAh yes last but not least\u2026 the QQQ\u2019s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793\n\nIts one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the \u201cshoulder\u201d yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this\u2026 I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). \n\nBull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. \n\nBulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. \n\nBear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  \n\nBears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/latynl7bflt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=891d7a74268c3d05db9b6a2e7b5c0202301636e8\n\nThe VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my \u201clevels\u201d on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tq8tztcflt81.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=906d7d725ab77b74b5f9b6ffba5ef37639fe14ab\n\nI am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for \u201cyou are a great trader but you aren\u2019t a weather forecaster.\u201d Me being me who is dead inside and doesn\u2019t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. \n\nThe one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a \u201csmall\u201d position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. \n\nI had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. \n\nI close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. \n\nWhy did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn\u2019t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn\u2019t sit well with me. \n\nI am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and \u201ccommitment\u201d on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. \n\nI have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.\n\nWeekly trade log-\n\nI made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). \n\nMy total weekly win rate was 72%. \n\nPut win rate was 79% \n\nCall win rate was only 40%. \n\nMy biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. \n\nMy weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. \n\nRealized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. \n\n20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%\n\n10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. \n\nThis is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. \n\nLooking back at the last month of data for more information\u2026\n\n76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate\n\n30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. \n\nThat\u2019s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. \n\nI look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. \n\nNOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. \n\nThis also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. \n\nThursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.\n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",

    "title": "General Thoughts (updated from the start of April) for the summer",
    "selftext": "So, to start off, the decline happened a little faster and more intense than I anticipated. On Monday, SPY was sitting right in that 100% continuation down area that I figured we would bottom out at for the end part of May. The move lower I think was the wash out event investors were looking for. It dropped off hard into 385 territory, which is smack in the middle of the 380-390 area many were looking for as the entry point. We rallied hard from there to end out the week. The same was true for NVDA, a stock I follow closely. It was flirting with the 180 support repeatedly, then plummeted down to 155 this week before rallying hard back to 179.\n\nThis does appear to be the wash out event to lock in a short term bottom. There will continue to be volatility, but so long as we don't touch down to the lows in the next two weeks, we could see a very strong rally right into the end of June. I'm looking for SPY to break 415 before the end of May and NVDA to break 200 before earnings on May 25th. I think SPY could rally all the way to 445 before the end of June, while NVDA could rally all the way above 240 before the end of June. I could see plenty of companies getting swept up in a general market rally despite deteriorating conditions within their own segment of the market.\n\nSo what is the cause of this rally? For starters, I think we hit a short term peak on yields. The high set on Friday/Monday on the 10 year is likely as high as it gets, meaning I think buying resumes from here. For the last 6 weeks, we have seen a ton of selling off in bonds and equities. That's not sustainable. Last quarter (ending at the end of March), we saw equities crashing and the selling of bonds hadn't kept up pace. In order to rebalance portfolios, we needed to see a mix of bond selling and equity buying to get back into alignment. So the 10 year went from about 2.15% to almost 2.5% in a matter of a couple weeks. We also had a vicious equities rally. Once that was achieved, there was a short bit of bond buying before we saw a sell off of both bonds and equities to a strong degree. In a matter of about 6 weeks, the 10 year has jumped from below 2.4% to cracking 3%, while equities has shed all the gains from the rally and then some as it achieved a new low for the year.\n\nThis was compounded by tax season during the month of April. According to Charles Schwab CFO Peter Crawford, \"Client cash disbursements during this year\u2019s tax season were the highest we\u2019ve ever seen at Schwab.\" resulting in billions of dollars in outflows. Still, tax season alone doesn't explain the sheer degree of liquidation across the board. Even companies like Apple haven't been spared, officially entering bear market territory this week. Where are people putting the money from this selling?\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal:\n\n&gt;Investors are moving their money out of stocks and into ultrasafe assets that had largely been unloved for the past decade\u2014such as cash, Treasury bills, certificates of deposit and money-market funds. Investors put $51.4 billion in global money-market funds in the week through April 27, the most for a week since October, according to Refinitiv Lipper. During the entire month of April they yanked $19.2 billion out of stock exchange-traded funds\u2014the biggest outflows since 2019, according to [Morningstar](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MORN) Inc. Meanwhile, 47% of global fund managers surveyed by [Bank of America](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BAC) Corp. in April said they had larger than average cash positions in their portfolios\u2014the highest level since April 2020.\n\nCash and short term treasuries are very popular right now, but as anybody on here can tell you, they aren't a long term solution, or really a solution at all. They are merely a short term reprieve for when you believe the market is in a panic and you want to avoid the worst of the sell off. You can't stay in cash and short term treasuries over any significant duration with inflation as high as it is right now. So these safe havens are absolutely a short term move.\n\nWhat they are looking for is stabilization. A signal that we won't see any sharp sell offs to new lows over the next couple months. That is the signal I believe the market is going to get over the next two weeks. As the market starts to put in higher highs and avoid lower lows, the buying signal lights up and the overweight cash holdings will start to flow back into the market, then pick up momentum. Yields will stabilize and short term safe havens won't look so attractive anymore since the primary point of buying them (avoiding short term panic selling) will have subsided some.\n\nSo, my thinking is that as the buy signal turns on the next two weeks, and we see inflows rather than billions in outflows like we have the last 6 weeks and buying momentum will build. This leads us into June. On June 17th, we will have quadruple witching, when the expiration of stock-index futures, options on stock-index futures, single-stock options, and index options all happen at the same time. This create a ton of volume and volatility. That volatility COULD go either direction, but you have to take context into consideration. With the end of the quarter in June, portfolios need to rebalance. They can't be weighed too much in one asset or another. They definitely don't want to be overweight in cash and short term treasuries.\n\nIf the market has successfully rebounded the next few weeks into June, the volatility is likely to end up on the buying side. I definitely wouldn't want to bet against it. Not only that, but if they see this as a buying opportunity, it could be seen as a way to make up some of the losses as equities rise, and position them to have more shares per dollar than they did before. So long as we aren't retesting lows the next few weeks, this combination of quadruple witching and end of quarter rebalancing could create an explosion rally, just like it did the last couple weeks of March.\n\nThen, take into consideration the put call ratio. Short terms puts are bought up in market downturns like this to protect investments. You buy a bunch of puts, say June 17th, expecting a downturn. This allows you to protect your current holdings to some degree. You have say, 1000 shares of X at 100 dollars. You buy 10 puts at 90 dated to June 17th, meaning you have the right to sell at 90 on June 17th. You just limited your downside in the short term for a small fee relative to the holding of X. Even if it fell to 70, you can still sell it for 90. Well, that's exactly what you do. You can either exercise the option, then rebuy at 70, or you can close the options out, reap the profit, which you will promptly reinvest into the market to keep a good balance in your portfolio.\n\nSo when we look at the put call ratio chart, what does it tell us? Well, for one thing, it tells that on dates like December 17th and March 17th, the put call ratio drops hard. Telling us that a lot more puts come off the market than calls. On March 15th the put call ratio was .7, then by the 18th it was .45, a significant drop. That drop off stayed low for the next two weeks. We had a massive rally during that time. Now I'm not saying the drop caused the rally at all. What I'm saying is that all that protection that had been bought came into fruition. These weren't being used as lottery tickets like we idiots do. They were used as legitimate protection for holdings. When expiration came, they utilized them as intended, and while those selling the puts got crushed, it created a ton of buying ability for those who reaped the rewards. And they piled back into the market.\n\nRight now, we are averaging a much higher put call ratio than any time in the last year, and it makes total sense. We are selling off, setting new lows, so people are rightly buying protection. But that protection is short term. Just like cash and short term treasuries, they have been liquidating some holdings to buy protective puts for weeks now. When those puts expire, at a profit, they aren't going to just sit in cash. They are going to use the gain to increase their holdings. It's not just the smart short term play, they're obligated to maintain a risk appropriate overall profile. So they will do exactly that.\n\nSo bond yields will stabilize or even fall some. Equities will rally. This will last until the end of June when this whole maneuver has played itself out. That's when lower volume will resume, and we will have continued volatility. We will probably trade in a range. That range will depend on how strong the rally ends up being. And that range could last a few months. We will get more economic data, inflation numbers, jobs numbers, which will take us to the second quarter earning results, where things could get really interesting (and dire).\n\nMy numbers for SPY are largely just technical resistance and support levels. I think the retracements make sense and so I don't think SPY can break 446, just like I don't think NVDA can break 259.",

I bought a put on ORCL today and SNOW just tanked after earnings. It brought down other cloud software companies with it. But IV on Orcl was only 40%. Snow had IV over 200% and will have to deal with crush. Orcl should print big. \n\nCould've done the same thing with Costco when Target had their earnings. Cheers.",

That compares with an $8.44 billion average analyst estimate. Gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining after deducting costs of production, will be about 66%.\n\nThe outlook reflects the continuing supply-chain chaos in China, where lockdowns have disrupted production and transportation lines. That\u2019s made it harder for companies like Nvidia to capitalize on still-growing demand for chips. Nvidia also cited Russia, which invaded Ukraine and drew widespread sanctions earlier this year, for hurting its outlook.\n\nRead more: Cisco\u2019s outlook hurt by China supply crunch\n\nThe shares fell as much as 10% to $152.20 in extended trading. Nvidia\u2019s stockhad gained 5.1% in regular trading on Wednesday, but remained down 42% for the year -- the victim of a broader rout afflicting the chip market.\n\nInvestors have grown concerned that the surge in demand during the pandemic years will fade, setting up one of the industry\u2019s hallmark boom-and-bust cycles.",

    "selftext": "**tl;dr**\n\nA better strategy for tracking Pelosi is to only copy her trades of companies headquartered in California and DC, because those are the companies that feed her that good good insider information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wj7fw6k1z2391.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797e4676ae286a4e85c242f1a49e7c75fe8cfe25\n\n**Background**\n\nWe all just wanna trade like Pelosi and ride that sweet insider information to glory. But as I noted in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uu6hc6/if_pelosi_cant_beat_this_market_what_hope_do_we/), Nancy has had a disappointing reversion to the mean after several years of outperformance. Did she get greedy? Was it a classic game of telephone where the information was distorted and led to bad trades? Is she human after all?? Who can say... But it's up to me to figure out how to get our dear Speaker back on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The New Strategy**\n\nIf the opposite of Pro is Con, then the opposite of progress is... This is the kind of high level logic I used to determine where ole Nancy wen't wrong. Surely she's getting insider information from companies, but she has to mask that with some garbage trades (probably sourced from WSB). How can we identify  the good trades from the bad?\n\nLocation, location, location.\n\nPelosi is a powerful figure in California and Washington D.C. It makes sense that she would be connected with companies headquartered in those states. The tech giants of Silicon Valley and legacy companies headquartered in D.C. that keep Congress' pocketbooks full in exchange cost-plus government contracts. **So I made a new Pelosi tracking strategy that follows her trades, but ignores any companies headquartered outside California and D.C.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Results**\n\nThat's more like it! This Pelosi tracker is back on top with a 50% outperformance over the S&amp;P 500 in the past 2 years. Even with the massive drawdown to start 2022, Pelosi would be killing it in the market if she just stuck with the companies she's connected to.\n\nCorrelation with the S&amp;P \u2014 73.51%  \nAnnualized Volatility \u2014 54%  \nSharpe Ratio \u2014 2.4 ([calculation](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/sharpe-ratio-definition-formula/#:~:text=Sharpe%20Ratio%20%3D%20(Rx%20%E2%80%93%20Rf)%20%2F%20StdDev%20Rx&amp;text=Rf%20%3D%20Risk%2Dfree%20rate%20of,portfolio%20return%20(or%2C%20volatility)))  \nMax Drawdown \u2014 67.5%  \nAnnual Return since 2020 \u2014 7.87%\n\n**Positions**\n\nAAPL, AMZN, CRM, DIS, FB, GOOGL, MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, PYPL, RBLX, V\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v49g3gk003391.png?width=1304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9720d3aaaf89d0d314d8c5affe765992d550e57",

What is interesting are the holdings:\n\nI like this Leveraged ETF because of the following:\n\nI would never buy shares of Google, Nvidia or Amazon with other high growth stocks being beaten down so far, but all three companies are having stock splits that are bringing their share prices for Google, Amazon under $150 and NVDA will be under $50!  The rest of the holdings are quality high growth stocks.\n\nAt the high FNGG was $33.50, this is a 82.5% drop.  If ATH is reached, that's a rise of 500%, and the best part is you don't need to pick sketchy stocks or put all your money into one stock to make a 5x gain.  All you need to count is the QQQ will go back to ATH sometime in the future, and that means so will FNGG.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Zen is the codename for a family of computer processor microarchitectures from AMD, first launched in 2017 with the 1st gen of its Ryzen CPUs. It is used in Ryzen (desktop &amp; mobile), Ryzen Threadripper (workstation/high end desktop), &amp; Epyc (server)\n\nRYZEN, a combination of 'horizon' &amp; their codename 'zen' &amp; EPYC, connoting a 'new epoch' or 'era' in server computing, &amp; change of 'epic' scale\n\nAMD Ryzen microchips are used in Tesla cars replacing the Intel Atom chips\n\nTesla started installing an upgraded accelerated processing unit (APU) in the newly-built Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y cars \u2014 the AMD RDNA 2-based Ryzen APU. Before this upgrade, the Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y had the basic low-level Intel Atom graphics processing unit (GPU)\n\nTesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, &amp; much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it\u2019s going to regularly update its computers with more performance. that\u2019s both for driver-assist/self-driving systems &amp; for the media center &amp; that is a scientific fact\n\nAMD is designed into data centers by some of the world\u2019s largest hyperscalers. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Tencent Cloud\n\nMS analyst reinstated\u00a0AMD\u00a0overweight $103\u00a0price target, I think $180 is to be fair ... I see a more\u00a0attractive valuation following the recent pullback in AMD which can rise 120%.\n\nFor those not in the know, the Ryzen (formerly Atom) is responsible for handling infotainment duties on Tesla EVs. It\u2019s directly responsible for the screen's responsiveness when activating menus, playing games, loading apps like YouTube or Netflix, &amp; swiping around the navigational map &amp; the new AMD Ryzen chip absolutely smokes the old Intel Atom chip\n\nTesla originally used Nvidia SoC's in its older vehicles, but switched 3 years ago to Intel' Atom CPUs for the infotainment centers in Model 3 &amp; newer versions of the Model X &amp; Model S. Tesla now switched the Model S &amp; X to AMD chips, &amp; completing the transition with the Model Y. Tesla's new AMD graphics chipset has PS5 Performance\n\nTesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, and much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it\u2019s going to regularly update its computers with more performance, that\u2019s both for driver-assist/self-driving systems and for the media center\n\nI am citing\u00a0strength in AMD's partnership with Tesla &amp; its server business warrants a higher multiple due to a wide moat &amp; growth trajectory, the valuation is really compelling. NVDA has been the winner up to this point, now it's AMD's time to shine, as it's notably cheaper than NVDA based on multiple valuation metrics\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[charts primed to go nuts](https://preview.redd.it/asv2hd7my5891.png?width=3492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842310a0e02e992e62f50eab1081c1944c485742)\n\nAMD next ER 07-26. daily chart 100% + upside",

Is there some way to figure out the proportion of share-holder type (institutional vs. individual)?\n\nFor example, right now, $TSLA is down because of *noise*.Sure, poor delivery numbers should bring $TSLA down, but firing data-labelers shouldn't.The value of Tesla is not just limited to EVs &amp; electric battery, it's also the tech that Andrej Karpathy &amp; team are building. Tesla is closer towards being able to do something that Uber never could. Ideally, more researchers should be hired &amp; Elon is cheap, so yeah, those risks are real. And yeah, that tech can be easily stolen (eg. Uber-Waymo), but Tesla is uniquely positioned to win in the EV market.For what it lacks (luxurious interiors), it makes up for it with tech.

Here is a link for the story.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-husband-just-bought-151000595.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nancy-pelosi-husband-just-bought-151000595.html)\n\nApparently, you dufuses don't know how bills work their way through congress.  \n\nFirst of all, the original bill to subsidize chipmakers was introduced in 2020.  Here it is if you don't believe me:  [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7178](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7178)\n\nYou will notice that the actual bill that incorporated the previous session's bill was incorporated in a bill that passed in January 2021.  [https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does)\n\nThe vote that Paul Pelosi supposedly had inside information on was to merely provide the $52 billion to make sure the bill passed in 2021 is implemented.  [https://fortune.com/2022/06/28/globalwafers-intel-tsmc-congress-semiconductor-plants-chips-act-funding/#:\\~:text=Congress%20actually%20passed%20the%20CHIPS,and%20funding%20for%20the%20year](https://fortune.com/2022/06/28/globalwafers-intel-tsmc-congress-semiconductor-plants-chips-act-funding/#:~:text=Congress%20actually%20passed%20the%20CHIPS,and%20funding%20for%20the%20year).\n\nSo, we have a bill introduced in 2020, passed in 2021, and funded in 2022, but please tell me how Paul Pelosi is dirty. Instead of acting like he's dirty, maybe we should follow his lead, and track legislation that we can use to find winning stocks.\n\nWe should return to the original intent of this sub where we find little gems where we can make some money before the big dogs jump in.  I mean heck, Rule #5 of this sub literally says no \"Political Bullshit\".\n\nPeace and Love.  Go make some money.",

    "title": "Bullish Argument for $INTC",
    "selftext": "Before I even start, take all this with a tiny grain of salt, I currently have \\~600$ in my Robinhood, and \\~500$ of it is in a long call for Intel expiring in 2024. Also took a lot of Adderall today, so I'm feeling a bit frisky w my money. So yeah, don't take this as financial advice, just my thoughts on the matter.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nAs of January 2022, the industry average PE ratio for semiconductors was \\~113, while $INTC has a PE ratio of 6.51. For example, $AMD has a PE ratio of 32.68, $NVDA has a PE ratio of \\~45, and $TSM has a PE ratio of \\~17. While all of these are great companies, I feel they are a tad bit overvalued at the moment - I could be completely wrong with this, but I think Intel is catching up in terms of technology.\n\nOther than PE ratio, Intel has plenty of other positives on their balance sheet - they are still one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers, they have little debt (at least according to FinViz), they have good margins etc.\n\n(source: [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\\~adamodar/New\\_Home\\_Page/datafile/pedata.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html))\n\n**Current Policies**\n\nWell, at least from what I understand, the political tensions between the US and China are fairly high, and I think that's really because of Taiwan. The pandemic really exposed how weak some aspects of our supply chain are, and one thing that came out of it was this global semiconductor shortage, primarily because a majority of our semiconductors come from $TSM, so the stability of semiconductor supply chains is, to a reasonable extent, dependent on the stability of $TSM and hence Taiwan.\n\nI think this semiconductor shortage opened the door for government support of the domestic semiconductor industry, and this gave rise to the Chips Bill, in which the government is allocating billions of dollars toward domestic semiconductor manufacturing. From what I understand, this funding will most likely go towards the three major semiconductor manufacturers in the world: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.\n\nWe all know how \"frugal\" the US government is with our tax money. In recent years, all three companies began constructing many fabs throughout the US, but both TSM and Samsung are building fabs for their current generation chips, ie. chips that will be outdated by the time these fabs are even constructed and operational. That only leaves Intel with fabs that are actually, at least according to their timeline, up to date with their technology. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chips-bill-advances-in-senate-heres-whats-in-the-79-b-legislation-161413736.html))\n\nWhile the Chips act may be a major catalyst for these companies, I remember watching a video that Intel is working with other governments too, particularly the German government, in order to build more fabs and relieve the strain on the semiconductor supply chain. (source: [https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel\\_germany\\_tsmc/#:\\~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/08/intel_germany_tsmc/#:~:text=The%20German%20subsidies%20for%20Intel's,the%20project%2C%20according%20to%20Kr%C3%B6ber).)\n\n**Recent History**\n\nIn the past decade, Intel has fallen behind its peers in the semiconductor world. Personally, I think this was because of their CEO, Bob Swan - he was into finances and cut the R&amp;D budget for share buybacks and such, giving time to companies like AMD and TSMC to make their products more competitive, eventually overtaking INTC. I remember in July/August 2020, when Intel announced for like the fifth time they are running late, their stock plummeted. Naturally, I threw in a lot of money into calls (and subsequently lost money on all of those in the coming few months).\n\nSometime after that, Pat Gelsinger took over and became CEO of Intel. He is an engineer and began to push for a higher R&amp;D budget for Intel. He has a pretty ambitious plan, but I really think he's going somewhere with it - I saw an interview with him a few months back, and he said something along the lines of \"I probably have more construction trucks working for me right now than anyone else on this planet\" in reference to the new fabs Intel is building around the world. I'm sorry I don't have references for these, I just remember seeing it on youtube a while back.\n\nAlso, another big change he announced was that Intel will begin making chips for other manufacturers, ie. Qualcomm, Amazon (source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/)). I feel this has the potential to extend to much bigger companies if Intel gets it together, ie. Apple, Samsung, etc just to reduce their dependencies on TSM as their sole manufacturers.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThe biggest argument I have for Intel is that this is the company that literally invented the CPU - Silicon Valley is literally named after Intel and its work. I do not see it failing to this relatively minor roadblock.\n\nAnother thing to note is that, yeah intel right now is behind in terms of performance to their peers, but their architecture is not in the worst shape. Like yeah in terms of nanometers, intel is not doing all that great right now, but that is not the entire story. Intel has always put more emphasis on transistor density. For example, the transistor density of Intel's 10nm chips is equivalent to that of TSM's 7nm, and the density of Intel's 7nm chips is actually greater than TSM's 5nm chips (source: [https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:\\~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30](https://www.granitefirm.com/blog/us/2021/12/28/tsmc-process-roadmap/#:~:text=Intel's%2010nm%20transistor%20is%20100.76,TSMC's%205%2F4nm%20of%20171.30)) The only real advantage of smaller ones is that they are more power efficient - there is not much of a difference in performance. In general, more density equates to more transistors, and hence, better performance.\n\nWhile smaller, less performance more efficient cpu's, like those of TSMC/AMD etc, might favor consumers for typical laptops and such, greater performance more power hungry cpu's, mainly INTCs CPUs, will always be required for servers. And just seeing the rate of growth in our dependency on cloud or server-based infrastructures, I feel Intel has a solid positive in the long run.\n\nIntel has a really ambitious plan, but I really believe the company is headed in the right direction with its recent moves, especially so if more and more governments agree to fund fabs in their countries. And that's my bullish case for intel, totally let me know if any of this is wrong or if you guys have any comments and such. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here, please be kind (especially the AutoMod) to me. You're welcome to discuss from your own viewpoint so that I can broaden my own viewpoint as well. Sometimes I may express investment misconception and you can of course point this out too.\n\nI adopted Value Investing as my method of making money a few years ago, buying cheap good stocks at bargain price. \"Good\" means a company with at least a thin moat (and well known) while generate satisfactory earning growth and having a healthy balance sheet,\n\nNow, as I tried to find those stocks I ended up almost nothing on my shopping list. For example, I went to scan the Australian market for low P/E and low P/B stocks and occasionally some high dividend paying stocks. Those stocks that passed my filter are like cyclical commodities stocks with temporary high profits, another was a well known department store but with a history of exec misconduct and I left with nothing but the bunch of unknown small companies (yes, greater risk -&gt; greater return or nothing!) with swinging profit and some are highly leveraged. What a waste of time.\n\nI tried with other developed markets such as Germany, Netherlands, France, ... but the results are appearing in the same way as in Australia, the bunch of unknown small companies. The good companies are always have a high multiples like $ASML, $MSFT, $NVDA, $TSLA. Those with low multiples are either commodities related or companies with shrinking earning forecast.\n\nAt this point, I start to believe that everything are priced in and the market is efficient in itself. Thinking about stocks as limited resources while there are new investors every year coming to find good stocks (and hold on for dear life) like me, and of course many of them are much advanced than myself and how in the hell am I going to compete with them to find such a good stock as most or all are taken. Shall I concluded that Value Investing are not working anymore? I don't even scanning the US market as I think there's always someone who monitor undervalued stocks using advance programming and take that opportunity instantly.\n\nWhat's your take?",

Among these 3 famous semi-conductor stocks (NVDA-INTC-AMD), which one would you prefer to invest in the most?\u00a0\n\nThe global semiconductor shortage that has left consumers waiting on coffee makers, computers, cars and medical devices \u2014 anything with a computer chip \u2014 might have an end in sight.\n\nAfter three years of stops and starts, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $52 billion package last week designed to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and improve competitiveness with China. The bill passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support, and will now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.\n\nThe bill, known as the CHIPS-plus or Chips and Science Act, addresses concerns expressed by both parties that the U.S. needs to bring the production of these vitally important components back home and rely less on Asia-based manufacturers. Supporters, including companies such as Intel and Global Foundries, argued that the bill was necessary since other countries subsidize their semiconductor industry, making it hard for U.S. companies to compete without help.\n\nLast month, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, speaking with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, emphasized just how critical it is for the U.S. to begin making more chips at home and why passage of the CHIPS Act was central to that happening.\n\n\u201cMark my words, if Labor Day comes and goes and this isn\u2019t passed by Congress, companies will not wait, and they will expand into other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cThe U.S. will lose out.\u201d\n\nThe bill, of course, doesn\u2019t preclude U.S. chip makers from also producing in Europe and elsewhere, but it does provide financial incentives to make manufacturing facilities in the U.S. more attractive. Intel has already pledged to build a $20 billion chip plant near Columbus, Ohio. The facility is expected to employ 3,000 workers along with 7,000 temporary construction jobs.\n\nThe package making its way to Biden\u2019s desk has a few components, including $39 billion that would give direct financial assistance to companies building chip manufacturing plants at home. A separate $11 billion is earmarked to advance chip manufacturing research and workforce training, and a $2 billion slice is set aside to move lab innovation into military and other applications.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/after-chips-act-us-has-long-road-to-rival-asia-in-semiconductors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/after-chips-act-us-has-long-road-to-rival-asia-in-semiconductors.html)\n\nThe US Congress has passed the $52 billion package Chips-Plus Bill Act and President Biden is expected to sign the bill into law.

In South America and other tropical locales, oranges are green year round. But in the U.S., where it's colder, oranges lose their chlorophyll and take on the color that matches their name. And because North American shoppers are [used to oranges](http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs195) that are actually orange, imported fruit is either exposed to ethylene gas or shocked with cold water in order to remove the chlorophyll.",

Bears are repeating what they've heard from their favorite Tiktok analyst about QE, how our economy can't handle 3%+, etc. When the shoe shine boy says the doom is here, inverse that fucker. But look, I looked. I looked at Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and your mom. I've got mom fetishes like I got 10-Q fetishes, and the generals--the kings of the Nasdaq? They're getting old. They had their best years. What do you think covid represented? The peak of technology. You think it gets better from here? AWS gonna keep breaking records? Think advertsing in Google and Meta are going to go up when we have TikTok, the new advertising king? If your dumbass company hasn't already switched its marketing budgeting and accruals to tiktok spend, your company is lagging. Only boomers use facebook now. Google hasn't done anything innovated in 10 years. AND **TSLA??????** REALLY???????? Do you know Elon just bought the idea from the real innovate guys from his  Paypal equity? That doesn't really matter, but look. I learned literally probably five important things pursuing a useless ass Economics degree. One of those is that **CAPITAL INTENSIVE COMPANIES ARE LITERALLY THE WORST COMPANIES TO INVEST IN. The one thing that separates TSLA from its competitors is not its innovation-- fucking everyone's got the same shit as them.** ***Elon has been promising FSD tech for a 2.625 years. He's been telling you lies and financing everything from equity investment.. Why raise capital through debt, when there's a limited liability through equity financing? But in the end,*** **Man's been overpromising and undelivering. Always, and forever. Someone once told me \"the chicken comes home to roost.\" He was talking about CMG when I told him it was a good investment after its salmonella poisoning, so he was wrong. But that quote has stuck with me. Elon isn't really Steve Jobs, its all a fa\u00e7ade. He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable. Man's worth 222+ billion now, so it's more likely I die before my man Elon gets exposed. But fuck em. I'll tell you something. Elon's company, just like AAPL, just like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, etc., -- we're fucking fucked. Why? The dream is never as good as reality.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnough yelling. Let me tell you something about human nature. **We count our chickens before they roost; we rest on our laurels.** God damn you see you that ring true in America. Fucking  Fucking Americans have so much security BEING American. We have Americans claiming they're so damn good when Elon has skewed average income to levels average persons never reached. We got bulls celebrating commodities peaking from UNSUSTANAIBLE LEVELS. Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, \"but that's another topic\" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost.

    "selftext": "**Key Figures:**\n\nAverage Volume: 9,690,000* (69% increase in the last 3 months)\n\nShares Floating: 216,000,000 (125% increase in the last 3 months)\n\nShares Short: 62,750,000 **(146% increase in the last 3 months)**\n\nShort Interest Percentage: 29% **(up 146% in the last 3 months)**\n\nDays to Cover: 6.5 (44% increase)\n\nSource: [Benzinga](https://imgur.com/a/Vutzigb)\n\n*volume figures varied slightly across sources, I used the highest to be conservative but I saw figures as low as 8,000,000\n\n\n**Company Overview:**\n\nI\u2019m sure some of you are familiar with Desktop Metal (DM), a popular stock that went public via SPAC in 2021. They produce a revolutionary line of incredibly fast 3D printers that can compete with casting on price per part. They hold over 650 patents and can print in over 250 different materials. Their flagship product is the [Production System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/production) which began to ship last quarter. Designed for mass production of end use metal parts, it is over 100x faster than traditional 3D printing technologies putting it leaps ahead of its competition. Their product offering also includes the [Shop System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/shop) for mid-volume production, the [Studio System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/studio) for prototyping, Fiber for the 3D printing of a variety of carbon fibers, their new unit [Desktop Health](https://www.desktophealth.com/) for a variety of uses including dental, bone regeneration, soft tissue fabrication, and organ 3D printing. As companies look to shorten their supply chains, Desktop Metal provides a compelling product to reduce material waste and cut costs. Their printers are already used by companies like BMW, Lockheed Martin, Stanley Black and Decker, and many more. Their products have additional aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, medical, and military applications. Their revenue has grown significantly from $26mm in FY 2019 to an estimated $260 in FY 2022, and an estimated $940mm in FY 2025. They\u2019re currently on track to hit all of their growth targets. [Here's a figure from the company detailing their revenue.](https://imgur.com/a/jr0Tx1w)\n\n**The Lowdown:**\n\nDesktop Metal sold off pretty significantly when the meme-stock bubble burst around February of 2021 as it was a company with a little under $50mm in revenue and burning $100mm+ in cash each year. It struggled this year due to market headwinds, high cash burn, issuing new shares to fund an aggressive (yet strategic) acquisition spree, and recently in May having issued $115 convertible notes to bolster short term liquidity, further diluting existing shareholders. Shares fell from $3.4 to a low of $1.33 after they announced plans to issue $115mm in convertible senior notes to bolster liquidity during Q1 earnings. Things were looking down.\n\nHowever, on August 8th, [Desktop Metal reported better than expected earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/desktop-metal-announces-second-quarter-200500454.html). They posted revenue of $57.6mm up 204% from Q2 2021 and beating analyst estimates of $54mm. They also posted GAAP margins of 14.6% and non-GAAP margins of 26.7%, up 170bps from Q2 2021. Blue chip adoption of their printers was going well, with names like Tesla, GM, Ford, Saudi Aramco, Lockheed Martin, and others purchasing additional printers. The key figure was the net loss of $297.3mm, primarily due to $229.5mm from goodwill impairments as a result of stock declines during Q2 and $2.4mm in restructuring charges due to their **Strategic Integration and Cost Optimization Initiative**. This is a big driver but I will touch on it more later. They also reaffirmed FY 2021 revenues of $255.7mm up 131% from 2021 and FY 2022 EBITDA of -$90mm. With assets of $1.4bn and liabilities of $140mm, Desktop Metal has a total capitalization of $1.25bn. Desktop Metal has been on a tear recently, closing today with a market cap of $940mm, still less than their total capitalization. For a company with such a strong balance sheet and incredible growth prospects, this valuation is insanely low. You can read their full Q2 earnings [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/120/desktop-metal-announces-second-quarter-2022-financial).\n\nThe main thing that DM has struggled with is cash burn. To address this, on the last earnings call DM announced a cost cutting measure leading to total savings of more than $100mm over the next 24 months keeping them on track for breaking even towards the end of 2023. You can read an article on it [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/desktop-metal-to-cut-more-than-160-jobs-as-part-of-cost-reduction-plan-2022-06-13#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20its%20cost,million%20over%20the%20next%2024). \n\nInvestors loved the news that the company was taking cost-cutting measures seriously. If Desktop Metal was not going to go bankrupt, the stock was seriously undervalued from even a **value** perspective with over $1.4bn in assets and less than $110mm in liabilities giving them capitalization of $1.25bn, more than 3x their market cap at their low. The day after earnings (8/9), the stock opened up about 12% before falling flat as the S&amp;P slumped on NVDA\u2019s earnings miss. Today (8/10), Desktop Metal closed up 14% at $2.99 bringing their 2-week return to over 50% and their 3-month return to 125% with a market cap of only $930mm.\n\nInvestor sentiment seems to be turning. CEO Rick Fulop purchased 128,250 shares at $4.0 worth $525k on 3/16 bringing his total share count to over 22,000,000. Despite this, short interest has spiked 146% in the last three months. Volume still remains relatively low, with between 8.5 and 9.5 million shares traded a day. If DM continues to rise as the market continues to improve its outlook on growth stocks, DM should continue to climb at LEAST to its initial opening price of $10. \n\nDespite all the positive news, short interest has risen dramatically in the last month as hedge funds continue to bet on missed earnings and higher than expected cash burn. Considering their cost cutting initiative, significant misses remain unlikely. If short interest remains constant or increases as hedge funds and other boomers look to short it similar to Tesla back in 2019, DM could absolutely pop as short interest grows and hedge funds are margin called to cover their shorts as they get blown out.\n\n\n**My current position:** \n\n500 shares @ $3.14\n\n10 $2 calls for Jan 19th, 2024\n\n10 $5 calls for Jan 19th, 2023\n\n5 $7.5 calls for Jan 19th, 2023\n\nI\u2019m looking to grow my position, but as a broke college senior it\u2019s all I can wager at the moment. \n\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet me know what you guys think. I think the only potential weakness is that shares are relatively cheap. If there is interest I will write a longer and more detailed reddit post either at the end of this week or early next week. I think that this is a company with solid growth potential and I do not mind buying and holding long term, short squeeze or not short squeeze. That being said, I think that Desktop Metal could double or triple on its own merit before EOY, sending shorts covering.\n\n\n**TLDR: Desktop Metal ($DM) is positioned for a significant short squeeze in the near term due to good fundamentals, low volume, and short interest rising fast as hedge funds bet against this potential big-time winner.**\n\n\nGodspeed.\n\nBrakonic\n\nEdit: Formatting and a typo\n\nUpdate: \n8/11: More good news! CEO Ric Fulop just purchased an additional 30,000 shares at $3.10 today.\n\n8/12: Found a better resource for tracking daily short volume [here](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=DM). Of the nearly 8.5mm shares traded yesterday, **6 minion were short**. DM rallied over 8%. Again, today, of the nearly 4mm shares traded, shorts made up 2.5mm of them, **more than half** at 56%. Short interest is still growing despite the recent 3-month rally. Bought 5 more $5 calls for Jan 19th, 2023 at market close. I also wrote a new post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wmx0uu/short_volume_on_desktop_metal_continues_to_rise/).\n\n8/13: I wrote a brief weekend update [here](https://ns.reddit.com/r/DesktopMetal/comments/wnfnn2/desktop_metal_dd_weekend_update/).\n\n8/16: Strong reversal off of a 7% drop with heavy short interest. Will update with short info when it is published AH.\n\n8/18: Another strong 8% rally even with **50% short volume today**. Will update EOW!",

This may be a spot of resistance in coming days.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aww8lrqeazh91.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8950372dd41965339fffb204a134c6a0307760\n\nQQQ pushed through its base today and provided an opportunity to open a position. Similarly to SPY, more volume would have been nice but we are still seeing decent price action. QQQ is a bit further from the 200 EMA and its April base, so there may be more room to advance.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nSince the markets have been acting decisively more positive I have taken on several new positions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33md33hfazh91.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=558b4e030a305cb0f1cc7966ba2e0430c49fb36c\n\nQLD is 2x bullish ETF that tracks the NASDAQ 100. For every 1% move the NASDAQ 100 has, QLD will move 2%, positive or negative. I opened this position Friday as QQQ broke through its base. Even with the overall markets behaving better I was still cautious and bought a small starting position of 20% of what I want my final position to be. For example, if my total position of QLD will be 100 shares, I opened this position with 20 and will add more if QLD continues to advance. By doing this you are able to keep your loses smaller since you have a smaller position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/of0eaq3gazh91.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31582ff01000eab0fb98ae3caa8eeb082c0a3513\n\nGOOGL also provided and entry on Friday and I opened a small positions of 20% of what I wanted my total position to be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtfhmungazh91.png?width=2280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef5eb6337c9015c7dea9934aab6c149ab40a0051\n\nAAPL pushed through tops from April and also provided an entry on Friday. Can you guess how much I bought \u2026 20% of what my final position would be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucajtu4hazh91.png?width=2257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90b87b4e5034e4081252a8460a73a0ad5df49175\n\nON pushed through tops from December and I opened a positions of 20% of what I want my total shares to be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36gtrunhazh91.png?width=2275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b66571adaa9bae40ef7dfd08b86d313535e9549\n\nELF is approaching a short base and may push past the trigger prices of $38.20. ELF is on the list because Sales are up 26% and Earnings Per Share are up 71% year over year. ELF also has 3.9 days of short interest. If we see a push through $38.20 with good volume and a good market this could be a buy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10ifg49iazh91.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba5a3a899303179c90471df17b41c8bdd72bacc1\n\nCLR is approaching a slightly longer base with a trigger of $69.50. Similarly we would need to see a good volume increase through the trigger price and a good market overall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83w78myiazh91.png?width=2267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04ff3e90305974fd518af490c78ffbe356c80c1f\n\nLastly, NVDA is approaching a long base from early June and has a trigger price of $192.80. NVDA is a large cap stock and can really move once it gets going.\n\nWith all of these potential setups it is important to remember that overall market sentiment can impact how individual stocks behave. If the market is in a bad place it is best not to buy. Also do not go heavy on your exposure, I would only purchase 20% of what you want you final amount of shares to be.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nThe stock market is in a healthy rally and many individual stocks are setting up for potential buys. It is important to keep watching for new stocks that may be breaking out. If a stock is breaking out do not heavily increase your exposure at once. Carefully plan out you buy points incase the market or stock reverses suddenly. Also FOMC minutes are being released Wednesday and that may add some extra volatility to the markets. Overall, we can begin to add exposure but should still have a slightly cautious mindset in case the market turns around quickly.",

    "title": "Cadence DD",
    "selftext": "There's been some mention of a crash in the air, in the event of one let me give you a silicon industry insider stock pick, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS). From [Cadence's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_Design_Systems), they produce \"software, hardware and silicon structures for designing  integrated circuits, systems on chips, and printed circuit boards\".  However, anyone who has ever done a chip-scale layout in the age of  computers knows Cadence as one thing only, the name of the CAD software  EVERYONE uses. There are a few competitors in this space (Altium \\[ALU\\] and Synopsis \\[SNPS\\] notable among them) but Cadence is a clear  winner in terms of ease-of-use and depth of features.\n\nCadence's software is used extensively in industry and elsewhere, and there's  only two things in the near term that affect their bottom line:\n\n[a) Silicon foundry production grinds to a halt](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/china/china-taiwan-strait-new-normal-mic-intl-hnk-ml/index.html), hurting larger design firms and killing smaller ones\n\nb) A competitor creates a better product, then in 5-20 years wins all of Cadence's contracts\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nCOMPETITORS\n\nBefore  researching for this DD, I didn't know of any up-and-coming chip-scale  CAD circuit design/simulation suites that have a serious foot-hold in  Cadence's market, but here are the companies who are offering other  \"design verification\" tools.\n\nLike  I've mentioned before, I think ALU is a looming threat to CDNS, but as  of now they're not selling too many contracts. I've seen Altium's design  software used both in college and in industry, but they are certainly  less popular as of now than Cadence.\n\nAlso  worth noting is ALU is (as of now) only really used commercially as a  circuit board design tool, the market for which is broader than the  chip-scale design market. There are probably MORE engineers laying out  circuit boards than chips, but these engineers work for the end  customers of the silicon industry, and not the foundry-wielding  behemoths we ought to be interested in investing in. Altium also faces  some entrenched competition in this space, from Cadence (which nobody  really uses for circuit boards, as far as I know), NI Multisim/UltiBoard  (which plenty of people use), and other names I can't think of off the  top of my head.\n\nAnother VERY  notable \"competitor\" is Synopsis, but they are not a real competitor as  of yet, as their monopoly is on a separate layout tool for the DIGITAL  space. They have commercialized a very clever algorithm to take logic  device CAD models called cells and logic statements as inputs, and  output full chip layouts. Notable clients of theirs include NVDA.\n\nMy  understanding is that this software is used to generate a mostly  functional design that engineers will then take into Cadence and tweak,  because Cadence has a full and DEEP electromagnetic field simulation  suite that much better predicts chip performance than can the set of  rules by which cells are placed and automatically connected. I believe  NVDA licenses both. However, if Synopsis develops a substantially better  tool for design verification ([and it looks like from their website they are trying to market/develop one](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/physical-verification.html)), they might start winning Cadence contracts over time.\n\nFor  now, they're both widely used, but if you see CDNS revenues begin to  fall, assume SNPS is gobbling it up. Both companies have had steadily  growing revenues since 2009. If we are going to see a mass exodus from  Cadence to Synopsis-offered alternatives, this will not be the case for  long.\n\n\\----------------\n\nTHE PLAN\n\nBuy CDNS and SNPS when market crashes. They will both feel the shock of firms dying like they did around the early 2000s and 2008, but both will likely emerge with contracts and profits intact.\n\n[Chart has non-linear y axis](https://preview.redd.it/6kgfrudy9yi91.png?width=1429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2ae094d8e317b6ef3958057accee983a2edd2c4)\n\n\\-------------------\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCDNS  is a DEEPLY ENTRENCHED favorite of the silicon industry that should  outlive a crash. Although we are seeing foundries go up all over the  globe, if China reclaims the land of Taiwan A LOT of high performance  digital firms will have to pay more per chip. However, even if they  don't, I smell a panic brewing.\n\nTLDR: Tried to write a defense of purchasing CDNS when shares go belly up, ended up planning a purchase of SNPS as well",

Not to mention beginning to surpass Nvidia (NVDA) in several metrics.\n\nRocket is primed to +10x again by 2030 thanks to good fundamentals and not just memevestors. Stock is way down, perfect time to jump on the train, or hold out for possibly a bit lower entry thanks to poor Nvidia (NVDA) performance and consolidation dragging this stock down in recent weeks.\n\nViable candidate for a quality meme stock as well.\n\nMy position in AMD: All in at about $41k, HODLed since it was about $9 in 2018 (now $95) and continued to buy in since.

    "title": "Real DD: ON is the company TSLA will choose next and is positioned to overtake AMD and NVDA.",
    "selftext": "# TL;DR:\n\nAMD and NVDA are Thanos without the infinity gauntlet. **ON is Tony Stark about to snap.** \n\nWhat we have here is an extremely well-run and well-positioned company with viable in-demand technology that posts both strong **value and growth** numbers. I will be keeping a very close watch and you should, too.\n\n# What's Their Schtick?\n\n**ON Semiconductor Corp.** provides industry intelligent sensing and power solutions that enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the efficiency of solar strings, industrial power, and storage systems.\n\n*Its intelligent sensing technologies support the next generation industry allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible.*\n\n# The Problem with AMD and NVDA\n\nWe are at a point in history where fabless chip companies like *AMD* and *NVDA* can design ever faster and more power-efficient chips **but manufacturing lags.**\n\nThe largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), being headquartered in Taiwan, has long been extremely vulnerable to geopolitical pressures from China creating even more pressure and doubt on the viability of chip manufacturing in its current state.\n\nIn addition, *Intel Corp. (INTC)* has been mismanaged for far too long, leaving chip manufacturing without a true leader and opening opportunity for adopters of **new manufacturing technology like ON to grab market share from these failing giants**. More on this below:\n\n# U.S. Government Chips and Science Act\n\nNow that the U.S. Government passed Chips and Science Act giving additional financial and tax support to semiconductor manufacturing that has caused the entire semiconductor industry to bounce up off of support.  One good thing about the bear market that we have been in is that valuations \u2014 especially for economically sensitive areas like consumer discretionary and technology that see big swings in valuations during bull and bear runs, respectively \u2014 come down very quickly, and too far, for some great companies.\n\nOne area that is sure to lead us out of the bear market is semiconductors.\n\nThe group's long-term fundamentals as essentially unchanged by medium and long term economic forecast . Still, valuations in the sector have plummeted and that has created opportunity for the right companies to make substantial gains.\n\n# Positioning into Power\n\nThe power business for semiconductors is no longer cell phones or PCs, that are shrinking about 6% y/y at this time, but the booming automotive market. Namely, chips for EVs are projected to grow exponentially faster than any other type of semiconductor.\n\nFor ON Semiconductor, this means, it\u2019s all about positioning into this power area, that as of Q1 of 2022, produces 65% of the companies revenue as the EV baseline growth rate is around 22% Y/Y. To further this argument, ON already deals with top automakers in on the EV bandwagon such as **Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, GM**  and now firm rumors of a **forthcoming chip manufacturing deal with Tesla.**\n\n**Silicon Carbide - The Next Gen Choice**\n\nON\u2019s positioning within the EV wave is solidified by its employment of chips made from Silicon Carbide (SiC). Electric Vehicles are very large electronic devices with large inverters that required chips to manage power at much higher voltage than your average electronic device. Thus, traditional semiconductors \u2014 made from traditional silicon \u2014 are exponentially less efficient in terms of handling these higher voltages and staying cool while in service.\n\nFacts about SiC chips...\n\n* **10x stronger** allowing a drift layer that is **90% smaller**.\n* SiC **supports 9x the voltage** due to its higher dielectric strength.\n* SiC chips have **2.2% higher thermal conductivity over silicon** allowing them to disperse heat much better and preventing expensive heat sinks that detract from auto design quality.\n* SiC boasts 2X band gap allowing for **much less power loss (around 20%)** while conducting.\n\nThis all adds up to huge benefits from EV designers with the employment of smaller, better conducting chips that can handle these higher voltages required in such a large electronic device and empowering better range, shorter charge times, less cooling countermeasures and many other benefits.\n\nTesla converted to SiC chips back in 2018 and NIO (the Tesla of China) converted to SiC chips in 2021 with most other major EV manufacturers converting their inverters to SiC chips as of this writing. **We are on the precipice of SiC benefiting from widespread adoption**.\n\n# Company Fundamentals\n\n**Margins and Profitability**\n\nON has maintained impressive margins across all of its legacy business reporting a gross margin of 43.8% up 5.6% from FY2018. VERY IMPRESSIVE. As a result, ON also reported much-improved profitability, with net incomes of $1.45B and net income margins of 20.1%, indicating a tremendous increase of 230.1% and 9.4 percentage points from FY2018 levels, respectively.\n\n**Industry Growth**\n\nIt\u2019s evident that the automotive (EV) and growing industrial segments will be significant for at least the next decade \u2014 with EV revenue projected to grow 38.3% and industrial at 48.1% with all its legacy business projected to grow 14.8% Y/Y.  ON has proven to execute well from an operational management perspective maintaining an extremely efficient operating ratio and even growing the companies profitability in this current environment with inflation and rising cost of production.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nON has also reporting rising Free Cash Flow representing 90.7% over FY2018, boosting cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The same is true of the company\u2019s debt remaining pretty stable around $3B and EBITDA declining from 3.98 in FY2019 to 1.36 due to the greatly improved margins and profitability. These trends are projected to continue.\n\nON is **both a value and a growth stock** trading at \u2014  11x C2023 EPS compared to 14.4x for its peers and 3.0x EV/C2023 sales compared to 4.5x across the same peer group.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nON will be one of the names to lead out of this bear market. The relative strength that is has showing is super impressive. The demand for chip SiC manufacturing across EV and industrial is white hot and only going to grow. The company is run extremely well only continuing to increase it growth number while still trading at a decent value compared to peers.\n\nON is not a growth name to miss when we start to see upside in technology, my thinking is it is the name to watch in the whole sector. That said, it is very tied to the auto industry, industrials and durables \u2014 all industries dependent on a strong economy \u2014 which is why we see the volatility and strong reaction to economic outlooks and is very important to keep in mind while we keep a close eye on this incredibly well-positioned and essential company.\n\nEssentially, we have an extremely well-run and well-positioned company with viable in-demand technology and posts both strong value and growth numbers. I will be keeping a very close watch.",

    "title": "Nvidia reported second quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations. Q3 forecast misses.",
    "selftext": " Nvidia reported second quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings per share.\n\nThe report is in line with Nvidia\u2019s preliminary earnings two weeks ago. The chipmaker warned that it would miss Wall Street estimates and that growth had slowed significantly because of disappointing gaming sales driven by macroeconomic conditions. It also warned its gross margin would drop.\n\nNvidia missed on revenue but Refinitiv estimates didn\u2019t change after the company warned on guidance and said it expected to report $6.7 billion in the quarter. Nvidia stock fell over 4% in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s how Nvidia did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:\n\n**EPS: $0.51, adjusted, versus $1.26 expected**\n\n**Revenue: $6.7 billion versus $8.10 billion expected**\n\nThe chipmaker said it expected $5.9 billion in sales in its fiscal third quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates of $6.95 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s gaming department revenue was down 33% year-over-year to $2.04 billion, which was a sharper decline than the company anticipated. Nvidia said that the miss was because of lower sales of its gaming products, which are primarily graphics cards for PCs.\n\n\u201cMacroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand\u201d for the company\u2019s gaming products, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a call with analysts.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/nvidia-reports-slowing-growth-after-earlier-warning.html#:\\~:text=EPS%3A%20%240.51%2C%20adjusted%2C%20versus%20%241.26%20expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/nvidia-reports-slowing-growth-after-earlier-warning.html#:~:text=EPS%3A%20%240.51%2C%20adjusted%2C%20versus%20%241.26%20expected)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is down 3.47% premarket. This comes after the company reported its Q2 earnings that missed expectations for revenue and earnings per share. Howmuch further do you think NVDA will fall?",

    "selftext": "**I still believe in the long term $NVDA story.**\n\nNVDA's 2nd quarter collapse in gaming has created an opportunity to buy a solid company on declines, ($120 to $150)\n\n1)The collapse of GPU's used for mining is expected to lead to a drop of 38% in gaming sales for FY Jan 23.\n\n2) Furthermore, used GPU mining cards which  were returned to the market, will also lead to further sinking ASP's. (Average Selling Prices)\n\n3) Gaming inventory will take at least 2-3 quarters to clear. As a result, NVDA's FY Jan 2023 EPS will be closer to $3.5, a huge drop over FY 2022.\n\nWhy am I buying on declines?\n\n* The long-term growth story is still intact; owning this stock for the next 3-5 years will pay off very well.\n* Data Center growth will remain strong - Data center overtook gaming for the 1st time in 2022 and should grow 53% YoY to $16.3Bn for FY Jan 2023, as Gaming drops 38% to $7.8Bn.\n* As NVIDA clears out its bloated gaming inventory over the next 2 quarters, I except decent growth in gaming as well in FY 24 and FY 25, especially on what is now a lower base.\n* NVIDIA's CUDA software is a big competitive advantage and allows it to price its hardware much higher than competitors.\n* The introduction of Hopper, besides additional revenues from its Mellanox acquisition will also contribute to revenues \u2022\n* NVDA also has an 11Bn auto pipeline over the next 5 years.\n\nI plan to start buying below $150, 20% at a time. Given the current market conditions after Powell's hawkish speech, this stock could tank to $120.\n\nAt an estimated average cost of $135, I hope to make 33 times Jan 2025 earnings of $6.5 or $215 - a return of 60% over two years.\n\nMy revenue estimates for the next 2 years are as under. All numbers are in $Bn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[NVDA Est Revenues FY 2024 and FY 2025](https://preview.redd.it/6mrl4x2qtrk91.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd70b68b7b3184e37eff007d8f8ff8420bdd019d)",

This shit faks me mentally.\n\nDo you think its good idea to sell my shares now? I dont want to be paperhanded but as i said, this guy is new to investing, i didnt yet see my holding down like this.\n\nShould i wait and buy more? Or sell a certain % then buy back later? (btw i'm mostly out of cash)\n\nAlso in my country with my paycheck i can mostly afford to put 200$ in a month, maybe less.\n\nSo again, how you handle constant red days?

Basically, the prospective buyers would have to fill out a form acknowledging that the Chinese military wouldn't be able to use the AI accelerators they wanna buy. Then they would get a non-military-use license. Read up Nvidia's SEC filing on it - [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581022000146/nvda-20220826.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581022000146/nvda-20220826.htm).\n\nThe SEC should investigate if journalists intentionally misreported the news initially to advance the financial interests of some groups.

    "title": "CNN reports - Apple is set to unveil iPhone 14 at \u2018far out\u2019 event | Will they also reveal their satellite partnership with Globalstar (NYSEAMERICAN: GSAT)",
    "selftext": "Apple is widely expected to give a first look at its latest iPhone lineup on Wednesday, as the tech giant has done every year in September for about a decade.\n\nThe latest iPhone is expected to be slimmer, but with a larger screen. It\u2019s rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model \u2013 meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.\n\nFinally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company\u2019s flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday\u2019s event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.\n\nApple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple\u2019s bigger breakout successes in recent years.\n\nApple\u2019s event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: \u201cFar out.\u201d \n\nThis has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.\n\nWhile the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.\n\nMany analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.\n\nApple\u2019s stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.\n\nBut with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales \u2014 and all the subscription revenue that comes with that \u2014 be enough to turn Apple\u2019s stock from red to green?\n\nInvestors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. \n\nAnalysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.\n\nThe company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.\n\nOne analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That's because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple's initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with \"macro storm clouds building.\" So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.\n\"This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years,\" Ives added.\nApple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.\nAccording to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\nApple is that rare beast, a stock that still is exciting enough for the growth crowd but is also attractive to value investors thanks to its reasonable price, penchant for stock buybacks to boost earnings and a steadily growing dividend.",

    "selftext": "Instead of type it all out I just took some notes  that show why I\u2019m pretty sure GME will continue to Jump tomorrow and next week.  In the other post I made I stated that GME is likely to jump because there is a correlation between earnings and large gains with Game Stop.  On top of that, here I also look at short interest, max pain and recent golden crosses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n:::::::::::EDIT::::::::::::::To all you naysayers.... People who think GME is Dead... I have to explain something.\n\nAnd this is above and beyond everything I write down there .... I want to be very clear about this.GME fluctuates (on average) 14% in ONE DAY, at least once a week (over the last year).  Every week, on average, there's a day where it moves 14 fucking percent or more!Over the last year, it has moved 8% in ONE day HALF the time.   When you wake up on ANY given trading day, there's a 94% chance GME will move at least 3%, a 50% chance it will move at least 8%, and a 36% chance it will move 10% or more.  And that's just your average run of the mill day.  Then there's days like what I'm talking about is likely to happen.  The three best days of the last year, GME moved 64%, 58% and 40%. Days like that happen every 4 months on average.  Do you understand how much money you can make when the stock jumps 50% in one day? Approximately 25 TIMES your investment (if you bet on options).  $300 is all of a sudden worth $7500.  $1000 is all of a sudden worth $25,000.\n\nI can only give you facts.  But any one who says this stock is dead?  You're out of your mind.  \n\n\n  \nEDIT 2::::::  \nI'm fucking banned for 5 days for missing my NVDA prediction.  So I'll see you guys next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ilxeogzoqm91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc71ddb045e0af912f21e03c97b3003c30248c9d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ym3olgzoqm91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf01f46c09edb62b87368de82193217fe7dd3029\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1eeg1lgzoqm91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7b1e9226121bb08aab3c9eeff1cc57ffe871e34\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pgi6lgzoqm91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c26dc96a762533cd5afa31fc926160709bb496e8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyfy5lgzoqm91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68b741a85e9eb7a74237d94759099f192867700d",

    "title": "AMD revenue warning signals deep chip slump; shares currently down 10%",
    "selftext": " Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Thursday provided third-quarter revenue estimates that were about a billion dollars less than previously forecast, signaling the chip slump could be much worse than expected.\n\nAMD shares dropped 4% in after hours trading, dragging down shares of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) by over 2%.\n\n\"The PC market weakened significantly in the quarter,\" Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said in a statement, adding that macroeconomic conditions drove PC demand lower than expected.\n\nRunaway inflation and the reopening of offices and schools have led people to spend less on PCs than they did during lockdowns when many bought computers for work and school as they stayed home during the pandemic. Chipmakers are also under pressure from COVID curbs in key PC market China, while the Ukraine war has worsened supply-chain snarls and dragged demand further.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (.SOX), which tracks prices of major silicon-producing and allied businesses, has fallen 36.4% this year so far, compared to a 41.2% rise in 2021.\n\n\"I think AMD is showing that nobody is safe from the post-pandemic PC downturn, and those inventory corrections are also impacting the company,\" said Anshel Sag, chip analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. \"Overall, this looks to be more of a cyclical correction within a single, albeit large, business unit rather than a structural or strategic one.\"\n\nSu said AMD's data center, embedded, and gaming segments maintained strong growth.\n\nThe company said it expects third-quarter revenue of about $5.6 billion. That compares with its forecast in August of $6.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million.\n\nAMD is the latest chipmaker to be hit by the sector's slump. Last week memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O) warned of tougher times and said it was cutting its capex investments in fiscal 2023 by over 30% to a total of $8 billion. Nvidia Corp and Intel Corp both delivered much worse than expected earnings in their latest reports.\n\nAMD said its earnings will be released Nov. 1.\n\nSource: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-sees-third-quarter-revenue-56-billion-2022-10-06/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-sees-third-quarter-revenue-56-billion-2022-10-06/)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is currently down 10% after the chipmaker cut its Q3 revenue estimates that were about a billion dollars less than previously forecast. AMD is set to release its earnings report on November 1. How much further do you think AMD will fall?",

All of these stories told of an ominous fate for  the tech sector above all others.  \n\n\nThe S&amp;P had closed lower from peak to trough some 300 days .  \n( further than the average bear market)  \n\n\nThe Tech heavy Nasdaq ( home of some of The most profitable companies in the world was off 38%)  \n\n\nit was a.moment of Jubilee for the DoTards of this world.  \n\n\nThe  rally that followed was looked on with suspect , Yet the chip companies  started reporting blow out earnings and sold out product launches at  prices that were the fodder of rampant jokes and much cajoling prior to  launch.  \nThis will never fly they told us as if their experiences with  flying objects ( perhaps broomsticks - fitting in the month of October)  portends the fate of the RTX4090 which launched at what was then  considered an absurdly high price. Then the proverbial launch and follow  on sell out of the product literally in hours set the outlook for NVDA  in a different light .  \n\n\nIt shined a light on the darkness that had  enveloped the chip sector and made everyone realize the narrative of  higher rates somehow miraculously impacting the tech sector demand more  than all of the others ( even though most electronic products sell for a  few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars not requiring a home  equity line of credit to purchase.) was a flawed narrative not supported  by facts but conjecture.  \n\n\nThe 13th was the day that made the rate  pundits rethink the narrative that rates would hurt small ticket  purchases as opposed to very large ticket purchases which would require  expensive loans .  \n\n\nSo the 13th will also be remembered as the day  that destroyed the heretofore rate narrative hurting techs stocks more  than others and driving the Nasdaq down 38% .  \n\n\nImportant to  understand tech stocks continued to post record profits and experienced a  multiple compression unlike anything we ever have saw based on a flawed  narrative associated with rate hikes during this 3 quarter sell off  period and wrecked returns for everyone.  \n\n\nSo now I say run hard chip stocks and reclaim that lost ground.  \n\n\nSet new Q4 highs that boggles the minds of the Simpletons.",

    "title": "NVDA GPU prices are skyrocketing ...",
    "selftext": "TLDR: NVDA will likely beat the low-ball $5.9B and raise guidance for next quarter easily... \n\n4090 GPUs are selling in hot demand after absolutely shattering the gaming records set by the 3090 last year at the same price point. The selling prices right now are &gt;$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. \n\nAlthough NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule.\n\n&gt;If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind.\n\n&gt;People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. \n\nNVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. \n\nThere are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei. I was bearish on Nvidia short term due to China, but after the recent hot 4090 and H100 demand and the 4090 benchmarks, I am bullish on NVDA. \n\n[1] https://wccftech.com/nvidia-allegedly-shifts-geforce-rtx-4090-gaming-gpu-production-to-hopper-h100-ai-gpus/\n\n[2] https://wccftech.com/china-biren-gpus-cant-be-made-at-tsmc-due-to-us-regulations-competition-with-nvidia/\n\n[3]  https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/NVIDIA-RTX4090-ML-AI-and-Scientific-Computing-Performance-Preliminary-2382/\n\n\nedit: some more good news from Supermicro 11-15% preliminary guide higher.\n\n2nd edit: With the release of 4000 series, the 3000 series gpu price declines that started from Feb 2022 to Aug have stabilized with some prices actually going up in October.

    "selftext": "I've just recently finished university and working full time now. In 2021 to early part of 2022, I had around 10k saved from the previous 4 years working internships and summer jobs, and I started investing during that time and as many others, I lost legit all of it.   \n\n\nFor a long time, almost all of 2022, I just didn't even want to look at any of this anymore, was so burnt out. But now I've started work full time and I have money I should be looking to invest, and I think it's a good time to do so for my future.  \n\n\nCurrently, I have around 15k I can invest and per month I can squeeze out around 500 to continuously invest.  \n\n\nI want to have a fresh start, and this time make some more smarter decisions. I've spent some time to compile a list of companies from different sectors I could star to look into which maybe good opportunities:\n\n**TECH**:  \nGOOG  \nFB  \nMSFT  \nAPPL  \nTSLA  \nNVDA  \nAmd  \nShop  \nSnap\n\n**Consumer Goods**  \nPG  \nWMT  \nACI  \nMCD  \nJNJ  \nNKE\n\n**Finance and Banking**  \nV  \nMA  \nTD / BMO / RY (Canadian Banks)\n\n**ETFs**  \nQQQ  \nFNGU  \nARKF  \nXEQT  \n\n\n**Others**  \nBRK-B  \nTSM  \nNio  \nSofi  \nUpst  \nAfrm  \nTDOC  \n\n\nNow, I'm still young in my early 20s, so I can still tolerate some risk.

    "title": "MVIS - Lasers are the future and the future is NOW!!",
    "selftext": "Early birds catch the juiciest worms!\n\nIts Monday cocksuckers.. And lady cocksuckers. And boy do I have a spicy one for you today...   Lasers BITCH!\n \nApril 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it\u2019s clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouch\u00e9e for what will happen next.\n\nDevelopments since April 2021 include:\nMavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It\u2019s getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.\n \nMVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for \"good business practices\".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.\n\nMVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. \nMVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an \u201cOEM friendly\u201d white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\n\nNow the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..\n\nMavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...\n\nMavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. \n\nMavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.\n\nMavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.\nMVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&amp;A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. \n\nMVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/\nTo which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???\n\nSumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.\n\nMVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...\n\nSingle Unit - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/3.jpg\n5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg\nTalk about classy..\n\nMVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July\u2019s earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying \u201cMavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen\u201d. Sumit\u2019s character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...\n \nThe MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   \n\nTheir investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. \n\nThey have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  \n\nIn January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That\u2019s a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. \n\nIn addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ\n\nDone so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   \n\nMany AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. \nThen factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. \nIt\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it\u2019s inevitable.\n\nOh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.\n\nListen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to \"short squeeze these nuts\" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.\n\nTLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW\n\nP.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.  \n\nPositions \nhttps://imgur.com/Z2dvqdS\nAnd a Spreadbet account that makes Bill Hwang look like a genius",

    "title": "ASTS - An Investment and A Trade (I)",
    "selftext": "# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade\n\nIf you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to \u201cbe right,\u201d \u2014 you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.\n\nThe challenge obviously is that it\u2019s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we\u2019ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said \u201cbe something when others are something\u201d? Yes, and today is your opportunity.\n\nRight now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential \u201cmillionaire maker\u201d name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.\n\nI am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.\n\n# 2/ The Background and the Backers\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.\n\nASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite \u201ccell towers\u201d in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn\u2019t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.\n\nAll sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.\n\nRight now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start \u201cunfurling\u201d on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.\n\n[BlueWalker 3 satellite and the ASTS team](https://preview.redd.it/33cpnveensx91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7059c581f68dd7f8adb8bb5663bea60f99ba61e1)\n\nThe TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.\n\nThe guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.\n\n[Abel Avellan, ASTS CEO](https://preview.redd.it/2x5ig8d6qsx91.png?width=1577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c58394f173020322517f0df528d7dc472ae80aa)\n\nOther direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational.

To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.\n\nThe market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It\u2019s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I\u2019d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% \u2013 we\u2019d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it\u2019s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman\u2019s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.\n\nDeutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:\n\n[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)\n\nInterestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.\n\nASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock \u201cwinners\u201d they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.\n\n[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)\n\nASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength \u2014 compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.\n\nPretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% \u2014 during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.\n\nNow we are back at the \u201csupport\u201d or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.\n\n# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts\n\nThe no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the \u201ceasy\u201d trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.\n\nThis year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.\n\n1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just \u201criding with tide\u201d as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the \u201ceasy\u201d bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.\n2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.\n\nAfter Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 \u201csupport area\u201d and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.\n\nI think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.\n\n# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts\n\nWe have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.\n\n1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.\n\n[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)\n\n[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)\n\n2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.\n\n3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.\n\n[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)\n\nOne of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there\u2019s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they\u2019ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)\n\nThe reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.\n\nOnce ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we\u2019ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.\n\n[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)\n\nDisclaimer, Risks:\n\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.\n\nTLDR:\n\nThe no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.\n\nPositions: 8,000 shares at $6.27\n\n[I prefer a larger share position than options as it is easier to manage risk. Will add more on positive momentum.](https://preview.redd.it/o0qfch6bssx91.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9575b7c4bc93d94bc85f20c402c9de08c42d8b)",

    "selftext": "# 1/ ASTS - An Investment and A Trade\n\nIf you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to \u201cbe right,\u201d \u2014 you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.\n\nThe challenge obviously is that it\u2019s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we\u2019ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said \u201cbe something when others are something\u201d? Yes, and today is your opportunity.\n\nRight now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential \u201cmillionaire maker\u201d name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.\n\nI am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.\n\n# 2/ The Background and the Backers\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.\n\nASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite \u201ccell towers\u201d in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn\u2019t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.\n\nAll sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&amp;T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.\n\nRight now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September.

Moreover, there\u2019s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they\u2019ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.\n\n[Note on warrant funding](https://preview.redd.it/ezj8i9n2gsx91.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6636812be27cf933dab429f7d34ae9097caac87)\n\nThe reason why I think the moves up are going to be violent is because of high interest from short sellers, including Kerrisdale. A lot of them will have to get out of the way on positive catalysts. Quick information from S3 and Ortex.\n\n[S3 information from Mr. Ihor](https://preview.redd.it/50m9ynmagsx91.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6777efdc98eb8a64f45ca01a22d52fc359ae21b3)\n\n&gt;Information from Ortex: 28.4% SI, 31.1% on loan, CTB 19.4%, DTC 8 days\n\nOnce ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we\u2019ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.\n\n[ASTS, 1D timeframe on TV. Imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/7gi5lhwlgsx91.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea893f025a23bd720618e445b213e2bad44da647)\n\nDisclaimer, Risks:\n\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero. If you think this is a P&amp;D feel free to short and add fuel to the fire. Good luck.\n\nTLDR:\n\nThe no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.\n\nPositions: 8,000 shares at $6.27\n\nI prefer a larger share position than options as it is easier to manage risk. Will add more on positive momentum.",

    "title": "The Netlist (NLST) Saga: How One Company Is Taking On Big Tech Giants Like Google In A Case That Can Change History",
    "selftext": "Many thanks to [**/u/DaveySauce**](https://www.reddit.com/user/daveysauce) for sharing this knowledge, research, and wisdom with us. This is all from memory, and he admits he might be slightly inaccurate on dates or information. I would urge everyone to double-check the facts. **He will be focusing mostly on the 912 patent...** His original response can be found in this [**Reddit post.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netlist_/comments/yg5xal/can_someone_share_an_easy_digestible_summary_on/)\n\nThis new post is v2 of his original response.\n\nBefore we dive in... For those that don't know Netlist and what they do, read the following. Otherwise, feel free to skip ahead if you do know them already.\n\n# About Netlist (NLST)\n\n[**Netlist**](https://netlist.com/), which was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Irvine, California, is a leading provider of high-performance modular memory subsystems to the world\u2019s premier OEMs. The company specializes in hybrid memory, combining DRAM and NAND flash raw materials to create memory solutions. Their patented memory technologies provide superior performance and high density at a cost-efficient price, with use spanning a broad variety of markets and functions \u2013 a market that only expands as technology use grows.\n\nNetlist has a long history of being the first to market with disruptive new products. For example, they were the first to develop the load-reduced DIMM, HyperCloud\u00ae, which was based on Netlist\u2019s distributed buffer architecture. This architecture was later adopted by the industry for DDR4 LRDIMM. Netlist was also the first to bring NAND flash to the memory channel with their NVvault\u00ae NVDIMM. These innovative products were built on Netlist\u2019s early pioneering work in areas such as embedding passives into printed circuit boards to free up board real estate; doubling densities via quad-rank double data rate (DDR) technology, and other off-chip technology advances that result in improved performance and lower costs compared to conventional memory.\n\nNetlist is continuing this tradition with the introduction of HybriDIMM, the industry\u2019s first Storage Class Memory product built on commodity DRAM and flash. HybriDIMM is the first SCM product to operate in current Intel\u00ae x86 servers without BIOS and hardware changes, and the first unified DRAM-NAND solution that scales memory to terabyte storage capacities and accelerates storage to nanosecond memory speeds.\n\nNetlist has a broad portfolio of patents, many of which are seminal, in the areas of hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication, and load reduction, among others. The size of Netlist\u2019s patent portfolio reflects its extensive research and development over the years, as well as its history of bringing innovative new products to market.\n\nNetlist\u2019s strategy is to combine its unique board-level intellectual property with a thorough understanding of semiconductor building blocks and system-level applications to deliver performance, cost, and time-to-market advantages to OEMs. This strategy is made capable with state-of-the-art, wholly owned, ISO- and OSHAS-certified manufacturing and testing facilities in Suzhou, China.\n\n# A Forerunner To What Could Be America\u2019s Largest Patent Infringement In History\n\nGoogle was presented with Netlist technology in the mid-2000s under an NDA. Google test-drove the product, and they liked it a lot. What they did not like and fought against was the cost Netlist wanted (per Google\u2019s argument). Netlist alleges that they decided to steal the product by making it themselves or coercing other manufacturers to create copycat versions of the technology to bypass any royalties to Netlist. In 2009 Netlist officially brought forth a lawsuit. The judge in the 2009 case ordered a random cross-section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. In that time frame (the mid-2000s to now), Google went from being one of several competing search engine/email providers (AOL, Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Bing, etc.) to have a practical monopoly on the entire market due to the broader storage and retrieval capabilities. This leads Netlist to assume that their intellectual property is one of the direct reasons why.\n\nNetlist has 130+ patents, and with all ongoing litigation, there are roughly a dozen patents in question across Micron, Samsung, and Google. The biggest of which is the 912 patent.\n\nGoogle's priority was to invalidate Netlist\u2019s patents since they had no argument for innocence (already caught red-handed with the technology described in the 912 patent specifically). With this and other patent disputes arising, certain authority figures in law and patent litigation (many of whom overlap with the same legal council that has represented Google and others in the past) arranged to create the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) as a way to capitalize on the complex and growing field of intellectual property law. This board was formally founded in 2012. The PTAB is supposed to represent an objective third-party resource to review patent validity and make the legal landscape much cleaner to navigate for district courts handling disputes. In reality, it seems to be an entity fueled by big tech to invalidate patents to get out of paying appropriate royalties for fair use. The PTAB is paid case by case, so they are unfairly incentivized to take on cases. Moreover, the judges have been discovered to regularly get kickbacks or bonuses on patents they can invalidate. These IPRs take a year on average. When a big tech company steals a smaller company\u2019s intellectual property, it will use the PTAB to request a stay on the case pending the review. It is easy and understandable for a district judge, who is paid a salary no matter how many cases they see, to accept the stay as it simply cleans their docket for the moment. Then post-review, a district judge will often adopt the PTAB\u2019s decision as their own without question. For reasons you may speculate, district judges have the authority to question or disregard PTAB at their discretion but often do not. Big tech has deep pockets and is happy to pay for this service as it is often much cheaper in the long run than paying fair royalties.\n\nThe PTAB grants reviews on over 70% of all requests, knowing that conservatively 50% of these reviews stand no chance of invalidation in whole or even part. Also, the PTAB allows multiple companies to request and have practically identical IPRs granted when reviewing similar patents - most of the time only enabling more time to be wasted at the detriment of the patent holder. In several instances, these little companies go out of business, allowing big tech companies to absorb their patents whether invalidated or not.\n\nNetlist is a rare example of a company that has only improved over time despite the odds and has more cash on hand, better sales, stronger hiring numbers, and increased r&amp;d in the meantime. So they are more than able to go the distance and see justice served.\n\n# The \u2018912 Patent\n\nA description of the '912 patent is [**found here**](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/08/04/netlist-progresses-in-samsung-dimm-patent-case-with-google-in-its-sights/)**.**  \n\n\n&gt;The \u2018912 patent refers to the use of rank multiplication in an LRDIMM (Long Range DIMM) memory module. Such DIMMs can have four ranks or blocks of memory, and the patent describes IP to present the LRDIMM logically as only having two ranks, thus getting over system memory controller limits on the maximum rank count.  \nAgni Research explained \u201cNetlist asserts that the \u2018912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning-fast search results. The \u2018912 patent played a large part in Google\u2019s dominance in search.\u201d\n\nSpanning a decade (which is unprecedented), Netlist and Google have fought over the 912 patent. It went through several reviews, appeals, etc. until being validated at the federal circuit in 2020 unanimously as SEMINAL and valid. The status of seminal indicates that it is a patented product that gives users a tremendous advantage and thus, explaining why Google went from one of many to the monopoly of the industry making trillions since. This is unwavering. Google withdrew its right to appeal further to the Supreme Court as this historic rule 36 style verdict (where the federal circuit affirmed lower court's rulings without any input or amendment) has never been overturned at the Supreme Court level. Google then tried to invalidate all 78 claims of the 912 patent for past infringement (accepting the claims and 912 validity from the time it was recognized in court and post-any \u201camendments\u201d done by Netlist to update/rewrite the claims as they are relevant today). So 2021 to the present, as well as future royalties Google acknowledges and will pay for. They are simply playing damage control on how much money this is going to cost them - and a guilty verdict on past infringement spanning over a decade can be worth billions.\n\nThe next battle was with \u201cclaim 16 intervening rights\u201d, as it was the only claim out of 78 to survive back to inception/infringement and is worth a substantial amount. As momentum built towards the claim 16 hearing in November 2021, the night before the hearing Judge Armstrong in the Northern District of California stayed the case for no clear reason for 3 months (it was assumed personal undetermined reasons). 3 months later she did a second consecutive stay. At that time she was offloading several cases and not hearing any, so it was likely for personal reasons and unrelated to the case itself.\n\nThis delay was unacceptable, so we switched judges successfully to Judge Seeborg. Seeborg went through with the claim 16 intervening rights hearing and ruled in favor of Netlist that Google is on the hook for 4-rank DDR4 DIMMs (a product that was used by Google between 2014-2020).\n\nGoogle was successful in limiting its exposure by avoiding 8-rank and 16-rank DDR4 DIMMs. A settlement would likely not come close to the actual cost of all infringed products multiplied over years, but this claim 16 ddr4 rank 4 victory alone could manifest in the largest patent infringement in US history (the current record is $2.54 Billion).\n\n# Google Is Not The Only One In Trouble\n\nIn related cases within the same timeframe, Netlist sued SK Hynix, Inphi, Micron, and Samsung (amongst others like Diablo and Sandisk). Samsung, in particular, had a contract with Netlist from 2015-2020 ish, but early on there was compelling evidence that Samsung was in breach of the contract and not fulfilling its obligations to Netlist. So Netlist unilaterally withdrew their contract and Samsung fought it in a breach of contract suit, ultimately losing as they were proven to be in breach in December 2021. It was tricky because Netlist was only allowed to give limited info to a jury at that trial and the jury saw the contract was breached and should be voided but awarded no damages. The jury deliberated quickly on a Friday evening and it was seen as a miscarriage of justice as you cannot have a breach without there being clear damages. The judge came back and granted Netlist nominal damages so that the breach would be legal and binding in February 2022. Samsung is currently in appeals with this suit but it\u2019s not a strong case for them at all.\n\nTo throw another variable in the mix, SK Hynix in spring 2021 got to the Markman Claim Construction trial (despite requesting stays for ongoing IPRs) and they were forced to decide between the discovery of their records or settling outside of court. An overwhelming majority (90%+) of these cases settle outside of court around this event. When companies run out of time-wasting ammo, they don\u2019t want their dirty laundry seen in the litigation public domain (because it's either a losing battle or possibly because it could further incriminate them with a plethora of other less-than-ethical business practices). Four weeks after the Markman hearing SK Hynix settled. $40 million in damages (pretty nominal) and a $640 million product sharing agreement so Netlist could have access to SK Hynix manufacturing at a discount to sell and pursue other smaller markets. This has already proven to be worth more than the initial agreement and has been very advantageous for both Netlist and SK Hynix.\n\nGoogle was on the verge of either showing its cards or settling. Samsung had no solid contract to stand on, SK Hynix already settled, and Inphi's trial was withdrawn without prejudice. Perhaps Inphi agreed to share incriminating information about Google/others on behalf of Netlist. Their infringement was limited in scope and they were since bought out by Marvell. Begs the question that maybe they wanted to avoid carrying over legal issues to the new firm. This is yet to be determined, but it was done without prejudice, meaning Netlist can always reinstate the lawsuit if they wish. Additionally, Netlist's verbiage has changed on motions filed from \u201con belief\u201d to \u201con information and belief\u201d - it leads us to speculate that Inphi could be providing information. The micron trial was also gaining momentum for several patents and was recently added to those that infringe on the 912 as well. Half the patents are in the West District of Texas (where there is a stay on the case currently) and the other half is being tried in the East District of Texas with judges who are not as prone to stay - more on that to come.\n\nThe 6 months of stagnation really hurt Netlist's momentum but morale was still high. Then Samsung blindsides us with a Delaware suit against Netlist where they requested a 912 inter partes review (a NEW trial proceeding to review 912's patentability) with the PTAB - something that was already reviewed 5 times and went to the highest court in the land and deemed SEMINAL meaning transformative to the industry. This particular product cut energy costs by 50-95% and significantly increased search/retrieval speed. No wonder Google became the monopoly they are today. So this was very puzzling because why would Samsung request this 912 review considering that Netlist wasn\u2019t even suing Samsung over that patent?\n\n...Moreover, since the patent is already valid, it CAN NOT be overturned, but Seeborg's ruling on claim 16 potentially can. The Google case was stayed for 90 days until there could be clarification as to what exactly is going on with this tactic.\n\n# Recent &amp; Developing Events - Fall 2022\n\nThe PTAB in October 2022 disappointingly granted an IPR (not surprising given their unobjective big tech bias) on the basis that the claim 16 definition of \u201crank\u201d multiplication differs ever so slightly from a definition of rank used in one of Netlist's older patents. So it\u2019s a simple wording technicality. It\u2019s difficult because rank wasn\u2019t introduced until the DDR4 DIMMs so that\u2019s what\u2019s being fought over. Same technology and method, just some use more material. By definition the core requirement of rank is to have at least 2 or more memory devices in order to wire them to achieve high memory capacity with lower DIMMs\u2026but never only 1 DIMM because that doesn\u2019t help to achieve low-cost high memory capacity - which is the entire aim of the patent 912. Samsung argues the definition should mean \u201cone or more\u201d whereas Netlist argues \u201ctwo or more\u201d as the use of rank implies that there is a row (or more than one). According to Wikipedia, \u201ca memory rank is a set of DRAM chips connected to the same chip select, which are therefore accessed simultaneously\u201d. Even the internet uses the word SET! A set can never imply a single unit. A single-rank DIMM has one SET of memory chips that is accessed while writing or reading from the memory. A dual-rank DIMM is similar to having 2 single-rank DIMMs on the same module, with only one rank accessible at the time. A quad-rank DIMM is, effectively, 2 dual-rank DIMMs on the same module. Samsung is trying to change the definition or sneakily imply that Netlist is only entitled to single-chip servers potentially, instead of stacked servers which is what Google primarily uses.\n\nIt is more disappointing by how obviously it appears that Samsung and Google are parties of interest. This has been overlooked by PTAB since Samsung skirted around any direct answer to there being an indemnification agreement between the two. To explain PTABs blind eye to this sort of thing, in 2019 in an unrelated case against SEVEN Networks, LLC, Google was able to \u201cconvince\u201d the PTAB that its parent company Alphabet, which oversees and controls Google, was not a real party of interest- so go figure. This is one of many examples of all that is wrong with the PTAB as an institution, and why the tribunal is hopelessly broken and in need of a complete teardown and rebuild.\n\nOn 11/3/22, Irell and Manella attorney Philip Warrick requested that the PTAB convene a Precedential Opinion Panel in accordance with Standard Operating Procedure 2 (revision10) to rehear the panel decision, asses the basis of Google\u2019s real-party-of-interest (RPI) status as well as the \u201csecond bite at the apple\u201d standard prohibiting consecutive wasteful IPRs on the same patent, and REVERSE the panel\u2019s institution decision. The facts presented are clear that the PTAB committed a blatant injustice in allowing the IPR on the merits of the claim alone and the fact that Samsung admitted in the declaratory judgment action complaint to requesting the IPR in order to indemnify Google upon Google\u2019s request. Clear party of interest. PTAB failed to have Samsung defend that Google is NOT a party of interest - as it was not Netlist\u2019s burden of proof in a typical procedure. Mr. Warrick presented 6 case study references to show evidence that PTAB acted unorthodoxly and antagonistically to establish a precedent. Even if the odds are down to a coin flip, it is very promising!\n\nIt is important to know that Google and Samsung have worked together often in the past decade to muddy IP litigations, double dip on time-wasting opportunities, and even fund each other's lawsuit defenses. There is no limit to the deceptive practices they are comfortable using. This includes incorrect annotations on word-limited motions to unfairly use more words to argue their case, manipulatively using the PTAB while being clear parties of interest together, lobbying legislation and political/judicial individuals, etc. If we simple retail investors can see this from publicly available information, then so can the ethical honorable legal representatives working to see justice prevail. Needless to say, reform is absolutely needed. With this news, Google and Netlist agreed to stay the Google case until the Samsung case wraps up as this is the final straw Google has to stand on. The consolation prize to all this is that Samsung was cornered into the Eastern District of Texas with judge Gilstrap.\n\nJudge Gilstrap has seen over 25% of the nation's entire patent litigation cases! He does not slow down for unnecessary time wasters and has a history of denying PTAB IPR-based requests for stay. Samsung and Micron are caught up in Gilstrap's web, unable to escape despite their many requests to stay or transfer to another district. Judge Gilstrap is adamant that the similar patents across Micron and Samsung be tried together for efficiency even though a few of Micron's patents are tied in the Western District of Texas and currently \u201cstayed\u201d.\n\nAs of today, Gilstrap is moving forward with the trials and Samsung just had their Markman Trial with Magistrate Payne (a pretrial hearing in the U.S. District Court during which a judge examines evidence from all parties on the appropriate meanings of relevant keywords used in a patent claim) on November 4th, 2022 for a basket of patents not involving the 912. On 11/17 there\u2019s a case management conference scheduled to set up a Markman Trial date for the 912 and other patents with Gilstrap.\n\nA wild card in all this is that Gilstrap's daughter sadly passed away recently. I am unsure of how much time he will take away to grieve. Family comes first.\n\nIf Gilstrap can push through and get one or both Samsung and Micron to be compelled into discovery, the chances are strong that they will offer a settlement instead of showing their dirty laundry just as SK Hynix did. The hope is Gilstrap will not be entertaining any more stays despite ongoing IPRs on some patents. Gilstrap is the authority, not the PTAB so ultimately nothing they do matters if Gilstrap is adamant about keeping the case moving, which outside of his family tragedy, he has shown no desire to waste time.\n\nJudge Gilstrap often utilizes the expertise of Magistrate Payne in the same ED of Texas to oversee a majority of Markman claim construction hearings. Judge Payne has construed a significantly HIGH number of patent claim terms (over 8,200 terms as of 2022) - the highest claim construction record of all time compared to other judges in past polls or rankings. Moreover, in terms of actual Markman trials conducted, Judge Payne ranks among the top five federal judges, magistrates, or districts, who have conducted the most hearings of all time. Gilstrap is also in that rank.\n\nPayne and Gilstrap have already had cases against Netlist\u2019s infringers (Google, Samsung, etc) before, and they are NOT friendly to them. As one example, back in 2014 in SimpleAir, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., et al, 2:13-cv-416-JRG, an east Texas jury entered a damages verdict against Google for $85 million for patent infringement. In this lawsuit, most of the defendants, including Microsoft, chose to settle. Google, however, proceeded to trial. On Jan 18th of that year, the East Texas jury entered a verdict against Google finding that it infringed on the \u2018914 and \u2018433 patents which were deemed valid. The jury struggled at first to reach a determination on the issue of damages of which Google moved for a new trial on all issues. The Honorable Judge Gilstrap DENIED Google\u2019s motion and set dates for jury selection and trial on just the issue of damages on March 17th and by the 19th the jury entered its official verdict for $85 million!\n\nIn two separate recent cases involving Samsung (Uniloc 2017 LLC v. Samsung Elecs. America, Inc in 2020 and Staton Techiya, LLC v. Samsung Elecs. Co 2022), Judge Payne repeatedly denied Samsungs request for stay due to ongoing appeals or third-party IPRs, respectively.\n\nOn 11/4 the Markman Claim Construction hearing took place over the 054, 506, 339, 918, 060, and 160 patents. Payne asked several questions to Samsung throughout the trial every time Samsung presented arguments and he was mildly arguing with them. The only patent that Payne seemed to question for clarification on the netlist side was the 339 patent. Netlist attorney answered very matter of fact. Samsung's attorney was very long-winded. For perspective, the more the judge needs to ask questions, the worse it is. Claim construction needs to be simple and concise. Not a complicated word salad consisting of several paragraphs. It appears Samsung tried really hard to finagle things to their advantage and it seems Payne was not entertaining it. We look to hearing in the near future about Payne\u2019s final decisions on claims and move forward from there.\n\n**In the meantime, all court Jury trials have been proposed and go as follows:**  \n\n\n* May 2023 - Samsung Texas Jury Trial over non-912 patents\n* May 2023 - Germany Jury trial (Samsung, Google, and Micron)\n* January 2024 - Micron Texas Jury trial\n* February 2025 - Samsung/Google Delaware Jury Trial\n\nOften these disputes settle outside of court before Jury trial. Netlist does not have the resources to continue paying legal fees and support a weak market demand (as seen in q3 2022 results and hinted that will continue for one or two more quarters) if nothing were to be resolved until the latest trial date established without having to dilute shares or dip into their line of credit available. That is something to be aware of but not frightened by. Many opportunities for settlement before that time. It is safe to assume a strong stock price recovery within 7-8 months from now with the hopes of the Samsung Texas case going to a jury trial or settling outside of court.\n\nThe first company to settle will lose the least. All other companies will likely fold shortly afterward. Once Samsung folds, Google will too. In my opinion, it is not a question of guilt or innocence at this point, but of who won and how much the winner will be compensated. Since they have been fighting so hard for so long, it leads many to believe the damages and future licensing could be substantial across all companies.\n\n# Future Stock Price Speculation\n\nTo emphasize a similar legal battle against Googe we must understand the Vringo case 2012-2014. Vringo owned 2 patents on AdWords and AdSense (software that increases search engine optimization for advertisements on search engines) and the judge ruled in favor of Vringo and it went to a jury trial. The jury awarded damages (30 million) and a percentage of royalties moving forward. This was re-examined by the USPTO (now PTABs job) and both patents were able to survive the IPR intact (but not seminal). It was then taken through the first round of appeals on the merits of the whole case. They agreed with the district judges ruling and jury ruling and even doubled the original royalty percentage!\n\nThen in the federal circuit of appeals, one judge out of 3 showed reasonable doubt to the patent validity (basically saying the patents weren\u2019t special and they were so easy a caveman could do it) and everything fell apart and all winnings reversed. The company still exists but went private and rebranded. It was a major rug pull after everything was won and verified many times.\n\nOur 912 patent has survived where Vringo\u2019s patents failed at the federal circuit of appeals. However, this is a tactic that worries me with all other patents not already seminally verified by the federal circuit of appeals if there is not a settlement outside of court.\n\nIt is worth noting that the single judge to discredit Vringo\u2019s patent was Judge Raymond Chen. He was appointed to the Federal Circuit of Appeals in 2013 by President Obama. Obama\u2019s biggest political donor: Google.\n\nEven if this isn\u2019t the biggest settlement in history, it\u2019s still substantial and the future licensing is worth more. With settlements in place, Netlist should be deep in the black and placed back on the NASDAQ instead of staying OTC as soon as they reinstate a Board of Directors. Plus, Netlist has an ace in the hole with future Hybridimm technology of which the CEO, Chuck Hong, says is worth more than $10B annually and already patent-protected. Netlist has all the makings of being the industry leader in memory storage technology. Search engines, streaming services, email, social media, cars, etc all need this technology and many are already using Netlist's tech without properly paying. They will all pay especially with the legitimacy of these litigations behind us.\n\nAs stated previously 90%+ of these cases settle before jury trial and before discovery into the infringer's records. So that\u2019s the rough timeline to anticipate prior to jury trials listed above.\n\nFor perspective, in 1999 Qualcomm sued/won against Ericsson and Motorola in a seminal patent victory and within 12 months post-settlement the stock went from $3-$90 (settling longer term around the $60 range). This was during the dot com bubble when the rest of the market crashed. I anticipate similar results with Netlist given enough timeline post settlements.\n\nI compare Netlist's technology similarly to how revolutionary NVDA tech was back in 2016. In 5 years NVDA went from roughly $20 to $700. If Netlist can garner the right licensing and their future tech is as magnificent as Hong states, then that\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility.\n\nIn desperation, Google had an agreement with the government and the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Sept 2022 to pay for microchips to be built by SkyWater to use as open-source research and development for future microchip technology. Why would Google be so generous? Perhaps it\u2019s their Hail Mary attempt to design around Netlist patents so they don\u2019t hemorrhage money paying for fair use. My thoughts are if they haven\u2019t designed around the tech already in the last 15 years, they won\u2019t be able to now. And you better believe they\u2019ve tried.\n\nNetlist is a true David and Goliath story where big tech has fought harder than ever to not have to pay for Netlist tech. Why fight so hard if it\u2019s worthless? Why settle with other companies often and not Netlist? Most litigation + appeals take 2 to 4 years. This has lasted more than 3 times longer than that and still counting.\n\nThe risk of Netlist losing and getting paid nothing is not even relevant as Google accepts the terms of the 912 patent and their infringement from 2021 to the present. Netlist is not a patent troll and they have an underlying business that is flourishing despite the litigations. The risk is more so to the time and patience of retail investors. On OTC there\u2019s also the element of broker/dealer price discretions as well as more manipulation from market makers who like to trade round lots consecutively throughout the day to walk the price down.\n\nThe way I see it, this is a powder keg waiting to explode and these prices are very enticing. If there\u2019s a worst-case scenario event and things drag out as long as possible, the underlying company itself in a bad economic environment is still worth $0.80 - $1.20. So it\u2019s not likely to go to 0 and go bankrupt.\n\nThe stock hit $10 on the Sk Hynix settlement and the exuberance of the noose closing in on google + others next. Progress has been made on all cases since that time only reinforcing the merits Netlist has on all fronts. The SK Hynix settlement was anticipated to be the weakest settlement of all current ongoing cases. The stays to the case for specific periods made the stock ripe for manipulation and impatience which is why the stock price has walked down most of the year (9 months of the last 12-month period have been in a stay). Many who are bullish long-term took the chance to trade the stock around the catalyst dates in the meantime, adding to short-term volatility. Longs will probably add more without selling the closer we get to finalized court decisions.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s a no-brainer, easy to hold and I have time. For others, they must weigh the pros and cons of the entry price and duration of holding. I argue it\u2019s a long-term hold with lots of tailwinds in the future. With positive earnings post settlement and relisting to NASDAQ, this could be astronomical as THEN institutional investors and FOMO retail will likely buy like crazy. Combine that with the short float outstanding and there\u2019s truly no telling where the SP (stock price) goes.\n\nSafe to assume $10 to $30 as a soft initial SP target POST settlements\u2026which WILL most likely happen in time. Could be sooner rather than later and happen outside of court if these companies are cornered into discovery.\n\n# A Final Message From [u/DaveySauce](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaveySauce/)\n\nI\u2019m happy to open up to any feedback or input on the matter as I didn\u2019t discuss all the other relevant patents and progress made on that front.\n\nBest of luck to all investors\u2026but know that truly good investors are not as lucky as they are patient - relying on their wisdom and research and then simply succeeding on purpose. Warren Buffett said the stock market is a device that takes money from the impatient and gives it to the patient. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. Many investors bought in for pennies and are already in the black. For newer investors, they may be temporarily holding a bag but if they can manage their short-term emotions I have no doubt it will pay off 2-40x with enough time.\n\nJust my opinion. This is not advice\u2026 as it is merely stating the facts as I see them and why I remain happily invested and follow closely.",

I do think given the last CPI  housing and energy will be very important as they are really the last  piece of the puzzle.\n\nThat being  said the only possible play this week is we might get a spike on PPI  release, but beyond that, there isn't much data this week that the  market reacts to\n\nThe Biden-Xi  meeting is going to be extremely important even though we might not know  what comes out of it anything for a while, most of the inflation is  supply side and if china relaxes covid zero policies we can see a major  shift in inflation\n\nThe UK budget  is going to be very important too. I think Sunak has no choice but to go  in the exact opposite direction of Truss just to restore faith in the  government and the UK economy. I'll be Long GBP before the budget  announcement\n\n# Earnings\n\nSome commonly asked questions I get a lot:\n\n* Earnings are lotto, lotto plays are 5% max position size for, 10% if I feeling wild. Please don't full port into earnings.\n* Check  IV before buying, the best time to buy options for earnings  is at an  IV lower than 50%, that's usually not the week of earnings, so buy  further out expiries to avoid crush, or buy 1-2 weeks before earnings\n* I  don't hold my earnings plays i sell at the open to get the delicious  spiked premium, and then IF the stock runs again i'll then buy some more  as an independent play\n\nTue 15 Nov\n\n**Before Open - Home Depot Inc ($HD)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST\n* Estimates: EPS $4.12 &amp; Revenue $37.9B\n* Options pricing in a 6.1% move on earnings\n* My  Play: Given what's going on with the Housing market and latest CPI  numbers, i don't see people investing in their houses, going with Puts  here\n\nWed 16 Nov\n\n**After Close - NVidia Corporation ($NVDA)**\n\n* SemiConductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $.71 &amp; Revenue $5.8B\n* Options pricing in a 11.1% move on earnings\n* My  Play: With $AMD not doing so well, I don't see how NVDA is not affected  as well, NVDA has not fully priced a miss, so there is room to the  downside here.\n\nThu 17 Nov\n\n**Before Open - Alibaba Group ($BABA)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST\n* Estimates: EPS 1.66 &amp; Revenue $29.3B\n* Options pricing in a 13% move on earnings\n* My  Play: With everything going on china i can't see how BABA is not  affected, they even canceled their guidance, not a great sign, goin with  puts here\n\nOther Notable Companies reporting that i excluded\n\n* CSCO - Small implied move\n* $TGT &amp; $LOW - I would wait for WMT on Monday and playing those accordingly\n* Tencent &amp; $JD - - Similar to $BABA, will make sympathy moves and earnings move will be small\n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- $LLY Long**  \nThe  idea that LLY sold off because of a tweet, is commical at best and  stupid at worst, doesnt mean we get a techincal recovery here, LLY is  approaching the 1hr 200MA, will take ATM calls to play the 21MA test,  which will be my exit, will leave runners in case it runs some more\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnwx8xq3luz91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c84ebc3fc27e4f4e2b5aaa52dc505a2c0efff1f\n\n**- $SPY Short**  \nWe  are very overdue for a pullback, i'll be taking a small short position  with expectations of a small pullback before the bigger run, My first  take profit target is 395 and second target at 392\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o9pdr313luz91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d76fb3034390adbe0c11b7cb9504bb5e0feb7cd4\n\n**- $SPY Long**\n\nAfter  the pullback is done depending on whether it holds at 392 or above , i  will take calls from there, with my Take profit at 200MA on the daily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/okoxoxa2luz91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e18cd4e6cb8774c702f0d18137c78b465600d75\n\n**- $VIX Short**\n\nI  expect in case we get the pullback VIX will shoot up to 24.4 resistance  level, and then on the SPY run will crash down to August levels at  19.5. Will be taking Puts at resistance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9668bjg1luz91.jpg?width=1488&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d36e1f703164989d98f94dde07a876e2e04297c\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nI'm  going to give some political analysis but please don't take this as an  endorsement or condemnation of any politician (they all suck our blood  equally)\n\nDWAC!!! We all know that Trump promised to make a big announcement on the 15th. IF he does 99.9% is announcing his run for 2024.\n\nWe  all know that the midterm election is ongoing, and expectations were to  get a \u2018\u2019red wave\u2019\u2019 with the GOP controlling the Senate and House, So  far the Dems got the house and the senate is a toss-up, a lot of Trump\u2019s  candidates didn't do so well, a big blow for his plans.\n\nAdd to that rumor that he initially delayed the announcement, to see what would happen with Nevada, and they lost.\n\nThe smart play here for Trump is to wait to see what goes on with Georgia later in December than announce right now IMO.\n\nSo  my play is DWAC puts, now this is a risky play so I'll be hedging with  some calls as well. But if the 15th comes and goes, DWAC will go back  where it came from quickly.  \n\n\nAlright,  so that's it for this week. I'll be doing this every week and going  through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.\n\nIf you have any  questions let me know!\n\nI wish you all a very green week",

I don't. So that will be two consecutive quarters of lower growth YOY. Not a good look, but obviously some of this is being priced in. We will see if they were too conservative. If they beat their own estimates, obviously that will be a good thing. So have these numbers written down and when all the news outlets start reporting the numbers, see for yourself if they did well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Keep in mind that companies don't always follow the traditional calendar year.

HD is more of the same, not a big move on earnings. Lots of chop and IV crush killed the puts. Got out of these with a small loss at the open. Not a great week for earnings plays. \n\nOur 10x Play did great though, DWAC was a sell-the-news situation and died even after the trump announcement, and hit our target of $21 and it was 300%+ play, not 10x but ill take it.\n\nFor those who don't know, I'm 31 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.\n\n**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $10,014  \n**Port % Change:** 1001%\n\n**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  \n**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  \n**Port % Change**: 102%\n\nWe are down $300ish this week, honestly not bad at all, its been awhile since i had a red week,ill take down $300 for a red week, any day every day. Its not as bad it seems, im currently have \n\n* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C\n* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C\n* COIN 01/20/2023 55.00 C\n* NFLX 12/30/2022 330.00 C\n* TQQQ 12/09/2022 22.50 C\n* SPXW 12/06/2022 4100.00 C\n* TSLA 11/25/2022 180.00 C\n* TWST 04/21/2023 25.00 P\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktsckvjk471a1.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd43491be55f5724603e31a41f722b82e9a3653a\n\nAnd plenty of cash, some of these are down a little so its pull the account value down, i got alot of time on most these. As the account grows im looking to do more swings than daytrades. Im overly long so i will likely add some short expsourse to hedge/balance the account a bit.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\nThis is a very short and uneventful week i almost didnt put out the watchlist, but its important to know whats going on. \n\nWe got thanksgiving on Thursday (Happy thanksgiving everyone!) and Friday trading ends 1pm because of  Black Friday, most institutions and traders will likely be taking a long weekend, so its a 3 day week pretty much. \n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Wednesday 11/09**\n\n8:30 AM Durable Goods Orders MoM Oct  \n9:45 AM S&amp;P PMI Flash Nov  \n2:00 PM FOMC Minutes\n\nAs i said very slow week, nothing much we can play off, FOMC minutes might give the market a little pump but nothing worth playing, will be good to see what was said behind closed doors, might give us a play off that, but likely nothing.\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Monday 21 Nov\n\n**After Close - Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)**\n\n* Technology Services\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.832 &amp; Revenue $1.09B\n* Options pricing in a 15.6% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow is slightly bearish but its important to note they never missed earnings since inception, its usually the guidance that kills them, i dont understand why ZM is a 25B company, going with flow on this on one, puts.\n\n# Tue 22 Nov\n\n**Before Open - Best Buy Co, Inc ($BBY)**\n\n* Retail Trade\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:05 am EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.032 &amp; Revenue $10.3B\n* Options pricing in a 11% move on earnings\n* My Play: With most of retail beating and very bullish options chains, im bullish on this one, will be selling BBY 2022-11-25 P $69.00, you can also take calls if you dont want to sell options, with IV too high, id rather sell\n\n# Wed 22 Nov\n\n**Before Open - Deere &amp; Company ($DE)**\n\n* Industrial\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST\n* Estimates: EPS $7.12 &amp; Revenue $13.5B\n* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings\n* My Play: Flow pretty bearish on this one, will go with puts here, makes sense with latest CPI numbers out.\n\nOther notable earnings this week: $DELL $DLTR $HPE \n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- NFLX Long**\n\nRight at 21MA on the daily chart and with a gap up to fill, i already have a position 12/30 Calls but you dont need to go so far out 2-3 weeks should be ok\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b822iml471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7ca2769c4f20251ab7413e26ee0305c6452ee9\n\n**- META Long**\n\nHolding the 21MA on the daily after multiple tests and in middle of a gap fill to $124, will also be taking 2-3 weeks out swing on this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se5xtv8m471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a49615a9f7b4f176a5517366fb5f1fde90cb3ec6\n\n**- TSLA Long/Short**\n\nAt major Support that has held 3 times so far, making it possibly weak here, if this level holds we get a a double bottom and likely move back to 200s, if not we will go back 150, watch for a retest and break/fail before entering\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04ud0cwm471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e7d0bb3d61d723824c57302a3b727410c5560c5\n\n**- COIN Long**\n\nCrypto taking hits left and right and new scandals coming out everyday, as we approach $41 coin becomes more appealing, will be slowly building a position here for when things calm down and COIN rebounds, looking at Jan-Feb Calls\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gs9pibln471a1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c67c9f39558996148549530fec9a8ca90d2fbb\n\n**Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play**\n\nNo 10x as this is a short week, not enough time for any plays i have to play out, i would say maybe short GBTC but everything out there is circumstantial so far, but actually be a long. So yeah nothing this week.\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "selftext": "I understand that you need to have level 4 options available. I'm interested in hearing from people that have level 4 options and a bit of knowledge about selling naked calls. \n\n\\- How did you qualify for L4 and through which broker?\n\n\\- Is there a limit to how many naked calls you can sell? \n\n\\- Are there collateral requirements?\n\nJust to give an example... Let's say that you want to sell 12/2 NVDA $210 calls. They're currently worth $1 and require the underlying to gain like 40% in the next week and a half. \n\n\\- Can you sell an unlimited amount of them, or is there a limit based on your portfolio value/buying power?\n\n\\- If there is a limit, what does that look like? Let's say you have $100k in your portfolio; how many of these calls would you be able to sell?\n\n\\- Is there any funny business that happens if the option gains in value but is still OTM? e.g. if tomorrow NVDA rises 5% and the options are worth $5/piece instead of the $1/piece you sold them for, will you be required to sell them to minimize risk or deposit money for collateral or anything like that?\n\nthanks so much",

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment\u2019s price.\u00a0 I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a Market-cap of no less that 500 million.\u00a0 The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used ( Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\u00a0  Things to consider when finding the plays-\u00a0  If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.\u00a0 If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I would consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.\u00a0\u00a0( If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out. )\u00a0 The trades are researched afternoon daily\u00a0\u00a0To find possible tickers making a big move.          | |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |",

    "title": "Nvidia: The Comeback Kid of 2023",
    "selftext": "Attention, options traders! If you're looking for the next big thing in the world of graphics cards, you need to be looking at Nvidia (NVDA 3.14%). I know, I know, the company has had a rough time in 2022. Its 4000 series GPUs were a bit of a disaster, and its shares are down 43% since the start of the year. But hear me out, because I think Nvidia is going to make a comeback in 2023 and crush AMD's efforts in the GPU market.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about Nvidia's position in the market. Despite its recent struggles, the company is still the undisputed leader in the consumer graphics card market. In Q3 2022, Nvidia's share of the discrete graphics card market increased to 88%, up from 80% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, AMD's share fell from 15% to 8%, and Intel, which only entered the market this year, has a 4% share.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"But what about that disastrous 4000 series launch?\" Well, sure, Nvidia miscalculated its line-up and ended up \"unlaunching\" one model and cutting the price on others. But let me tell you, the company's pricing flexibility gives it a huge advantage over AMD. It's rumored that Nvidia's RTX 4080 16GB costs as little as $300 to manufacture, while AMD's RX 7900 XTX costs as much as $500. That means Nvidia can watch what AMD does and adjust its prices accordingly.\n\nBut wait, there's more! There are also rumors that Nvidia is working on a new line of GPUs that will be even more powerful and efficient than the 4000 series. If these rumors are true, and I have a feeling they are, Nvidia will be able to offer gamers even better performance at a lower price than AMD.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm bullish on Nvidia for 2023. The company may have had a rough year in 2022, but its market share, pricing flexibility, and rumored new GPUs give it the potential to crush AMD and dominate the market.\n\nTLDR: Nvidia had it rough in 2022, but its share price, pricing flexibility, and possible new GPUs give it a strong shot to crush AMD in 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/12/why-nvidia-can-crush-amd-once-again-in-2023/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/12/why-nvidia-can-crush-amd-once-again-in-2023/)",

    "title": "Which one would you buy the dip? $NVDA VS $AMD",
    "selftext": "Who\u2019s better? $NVDA VS $AMD \n\n  \n$NVDA and $AMD stocks are down 60% in the last year. Is it a good time to invest or too dangerous?\n\n  \n$NVDA started off making chips for video games and now is leading with high-performance GPUs for PC gaming, augmented virtualization, and data centers. Also, getting into new projects with their AI, powering the metaverse, creating EARTH 2 (helping predict climate change), data centers, and simulators in the AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES industry (with clients from $MBG.DEDE to $NIO).\n\n  \n$AMD similar to $NVDA is a semiconductor company that operated in the computing and graphics segments. Some of $AMD's main projects are, Google Cloud Confidential Computing, advancing data centers, discoveries on mars, and the advance of AI getting into smart homes and autonomous vehicles. Also, $AMD recently acquired Xilinx to tap the high-performance and adaptive computing opportunity.\n\n  \nAt the height of the pandemic, semiconductors stocks witnessed a high demand and growth, with everyone upgrading the devices while staying at home, making three years of sales in two.\n\n  \nNow worldwide PC shipments reported their steepest-ever decline of 19.5% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa reported the sharpest dip of 26.4%.\n\nMany businesses lowered their technology spending due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\n  \nWhich one would you buy the dip?\n\n* $AMD has a market cap of 104B and $16.434B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 29%.\n* $NVDA has a market cap of 400B and $26.914B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 16.5%\n* Debt/ Equity ratio of $NVDA is 0.492 compared to $AMD 0.053\n* Price to FCF of $AMD 27.635, $NVDA is 83.393\n* $NVDA P/S is 14.066 compared to $AMD 4.139\n\n$AMD like $NVDA has a lot of similarities and will probably benefit a lot from its work with open AI and autonomous vehicles. $NVDA has an advantage in GPUs for PC gaming but $AMD has a diverse product portfolio of CPU, SoC, FPGA, and GPU.\n\n  \nLooking at its financials, projects, and company history I would invest in $AMD.\n\n  \nWhat would you invest in?",

    "selftext": " PCE report in the morning makes or breaks today's rebound.\n\nThe  tech(s) sector ( many but not all stocks in that sector ) are insanely  overvalued with price to sales ratios in the high double digits for some  stocks in that sector and many of those have not turned a profit and  most likelyy will not for many many quarters or years even. \n\nSome highly profitable stocks in that sector have p/e ratios that are in the mid to high triple digits.\n\nThe \"  rule of 40 \" growth stock narrative is a flawed method for ascribing value.\n\nProfit is the only thing that pays the bills. Hopium accounts for no slow down in the economy.\n\nThen we have the issues with the semi sector  \n( Biden Policy change, supply glut, pc sales slow down , i-phone sales slow down and the bev slow down . ) \n\nThe question is , has all of that been priced in ?   \nI called the tech sector rebound on October 13th ( NVDA was 108 ,AMD 54 ,etc)   \nBut  the point is, having rebounded ( the aforementioned bear market rally)  whereby S&amp;P hit 4145 or so and NVDA hit 187.90  and then the follow  on sell off to today's low makes me wonder how much downside or upside  is left in that sector. ( perhaps it is now a sideways trade ? )\n\nAs  for me, the easy money has been made and i need to see blowout earnings  and what i consider to be oversold conditions before i play that sector  again.\n\nif SOXL goes down to mid to low single digits again , i may be all in again.\n\nFor  now, we have a 50/50 chance of a very strong rally if PCE is favorable  to a fed pivot but absent that we have a questionable path .\n\nTime for some serious reflection .\n\nI  look for Powell to make a mistake with yet another hawkish raise and he  is not going to get to 2% GDP in my mind and neither should he.\n\ni see no problem with current growth as long as prices are coming down.\n\nI  don't think he has factored in the Economic reopening impact which  would make abundant jobs available and the stimulus money running out in  many cases which would cause people to go back to work  and neither has  he factored in Wage inflation and or tax increases and the government  spending.\n\nall of these factors , imo, are enough to produce a 3% GDP constant .\n\nBut perhaps i am wrong and he gets to his 2%   \nif so, i think he will have severely overshot on rates and totally thrown us into a recession.\n\ncaveat Emptor.",

    "title": "Let's talk chip stocks - what's still oversold and overbought in this macroeconomic shitshow.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: NVDA, AMD, overbought, TSM, INTC oversold with limited downside +5% dividends on INTC and 2.39% dividends on TSM\n\n**Tech macrosector analysis:**\n\n\nCrypto GPU mining is essentially dead, killing the \"gaming\" market for both NVDA and AMD, with INTC largely unaffected. \"gaming\" revenue accounts for roughly 40% of NVDA's and AMD's revenue. Although if we factor in forward looking trends, there is significant investment in INTC for manufacturing within USA, while NVDA/AMD still rely on TSMC for chip production, this can significantly boost the revenue and outlook of INTC if supply chain issues continue with the global trends looking negative with international relations with China being largely negative. Although TSM has invested in manufacturing plants within the US, it's questionable if it can support the current volume demand or future volume demand for the west. \n\nOne advantage NVDA has is its GPU market share dominating the AI space, with its GPUs being the predominant brand used for AI research and DIY at home use. As AI tech picks up steam, we may see NVDA's forward looking revenue improve within the next year or two. AMD lacks both manufacturing investment advantage as well as a growth outlook for AI sector, therefore I am most bearish on AMD from a technological innovation standpoint.\n\n\n**Fundamentals**:\n\nEPS:\n\n\n\n\n\nStock| EPS | 3-YR Qtrly EPS drawdown| 3-YR Stock Drawdown | current P/E ratio\n---|---|----|----|----\nNVDA | $0.27 | 77% | 57% | 60x\nAMD | $0.04 |  97% | 59% | 38x\nINTC | $0.25 | 87% | 62% | 8x\nTSM | $1.78 | -283% (growth)| 45% | 13x\n\n\nAlthough initially the price drawdown for INTC may seem fair given the quarterly EPS decline, I believe the significant drawdowns on INTC is due to investment into manufacturing plants and processes within the USA, which I believe will pay off in the coming years compared with NVDA and AMD. TSM drawdown seems unjustified given the continued increase in EPS through the economic downturn, although we may see a drawdown at some point if macroeconomics worsens, TSM remains a strong bet as semiconductors will always be in continued demand for the foreseeable future. NVDA and AMD are extremely overvalued from a P/E ratio standpoint, as a ton of growth and hype was priced in given their exposure to cryptomining and technical outlook vs their competitors, but I believe AMD is falling behind in both processor and graphics vs Intel and NVDA. I believe both AMD and NVDA has significant downward price momentum to reduce their P/E ratio to be more in line with the macroeconomic outlook and improve their realistic evaluations.\n\nHow I would play the market:\n\n**Long side:**\n\nIf you want to take a long position or positions with minimal downside through the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, I would invest heavily into INTC and TSM as these both continue to perform in terms of dividends and have P/E ratios that are very reasonable. Plus they also provide significant dividend returns even while stock price dips. I would take a lesser position in TSM if any, due to uncertainty with China, but if you want exposure to any upside from NVDA and AMD, it may be better just to take a position in TSM rather than either NVDA or AMD, as any demand growth from them will be passed through to TSM.\n\n**Short side:**\n\nI believe NVDA and AMD both have significant drawdowns in share price to go. Given the P/E ratios of both companies, I have taken short position in NVDA multiple times since Q4, but I also do not believe that the 97% EPS drawdown is priced in for AMD either.\n\n**Current positions:**\nOut of the above mentioned, I hold:\n\nLong: 600 shares INTC\n\nShort: 10x 130P 17 FEB 23 NVDA\n\nNone of this is investment advice, not guaranteed to be accurate, DYOR, I hold no liability, I wrote this for entertainment purposes only. etc. etc.",

    "title": "My thoughts before I take a break.",
    "selftext": "I'm going to take some time off Reddit &amp; other social media + from being super active in the market. I'm doing very poorly in school, and my mental &amp; physical health has deteriorated with my obsession with making money and watching the market 10 hours a day. It has paid off so far, but there is more to life than just money. Let me share some of my thoughts before I take a break.\n\nCurrent positioning across all 7 accounts:\n\n\\~250k $ASTS shares long.\n\n524 shares short $CAT.\n\n\\~6000 shares short $NVDA.\n\nI am currently using margin.\n\n**Quick Highlights:**\n\n**For $ASTS long:** AST Spacemobile wants to provide cellular broadband connectivity to the entire world. There are billions of people worldwide who don't have reliable access to the internet, and AST wants to close the digital divide through its patented technology. They will have little to no customer acquisition costs and are strategically partnered with AT&amp;T, Vodafone, Nokia, American Tower, Rakuten, etc. I personally believe that it provides one of the most asymmetrical r / r on the long side of the market right now. There is a chance that the stock goes to 0 if the tech/funding does not work as planned, but if the tech/funding works as planned, a 100x+ is possible (run your own DCF model). The tech has been partially validated through BW1 (cell phone in orbit) and BW2 (antenna on the ground), and also their strategic partners have done extensive DD on them. Full validation of technology is currently set to be completed in the coming months. There are also funding risks, but there is the possibility that the Rural 5g Fund and their strategic partners might close the current funding gap. This is a high-risk potentially high-reward play so only risk what you can afford to lose. There might be some risks that I am unaware of. Do your own DD.\n\n**This is both a trade and an investment for me.**\n\nHere is some more extensive DD\n\n[https://transhumanica.com/asts](https://transhumanica.com/asts)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast\\_spacemobile\\_the\\_starlink\\_of\\_smartphones/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast_spacemobile_the_starlink_of_smartphones/)\n\n**For $NVDA short:**  A lot of demand was pulled forward during COVID in the semiconductor industry. There's geopolitical risk. Sales are slowing. Insane P/E in a risk-off environment. It's still priced like a hypergrowth stock when it's already one of the largest companies in the world. Margin compressions. Supply chain issues. The growth story is dead right now, and the current market is just unforgiving. Etc. Etc. Etc. I don't think these factors are fully priced in yet. And the rally from recent lows was just insanity. I'm not going to give a PT, but I'm still holding my short at the given moment. I personally think we see much lower, but the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent.\n\n**For $CAT short:** Pretty simple thesis: It's a cyclical business and we're entering a recession. + Risk-free rate has changed. No reason it should be up \\~50% from the yearly lows and trading at/near all-time highs in this type of environment. I don't believe the growth story here. Construction should slow down worldwide as the recession hits, and assets will be repriced with the change in the risk-free rate.\n\nOne of my theories that Jeremy Grantham shares are that not all sectors/stocks will fall at the same time. They fall in a staggered fashion. This will let us rotate our shorts around and keep compounding gains if you can get the timing down right.\n\nLet me share another interesting thing (\\*wink-wink\\*): Look at the Dow, and the individual stocks that make up the index. There are a lot of institutions hiding there, and a lot of the recent moves in those individual stocks do not make sense in this risk-off environment. I'm looking at you $CAT (there are a bunch more).\n\nBe careful of bear market rallies, inflation coming roaring back (look at history), earnings recession etc. Stay rooted in reality.\n\nI will be active till the new year, and I am not sure when I will be back.\n\nNone of this is financial advice, and without notice, and at any given moment, I can open new positions and close any position that I may have. I might also change my mind on how I view these companies and the broader market. As always, do your own DD, and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing. Love you all, and wish you all the best. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "First off, I am aware that NVDA literally got cut in half YTD.\nSo, on average, shorting it throughout 2022 has been a massively profitable undertaking and \"the time to buy puts was exactly 1 year ago\".\n\nWith those snarky comments out of the way, NVDA is still sitting on a PE of ~62 and forward PE of ~38.\n\nThat seems way too high in the current macroeconomic environment.\n\n* Fed isn't done raising rates yet. We are yet to reach the terminal rate and they have been clear in wanting to keep it there for a while.\n* Rates take some time to work through the real economy. I do think we haven't seen the pain JPOW spike of, at least in the real economy.\n* There's been real and heavy gamer backlash against the 4000 series GPUs when prices where revealed. Gamers genuinely think NVDA has lost the plot and think they can charge whichever price.\n* Coupled with the end of GPU crypto mining, the market is flooded with cheap and still very high performance 3000 series GPUs, not generating any revenue for NVDA.\n* Their GPUs are used for state of the art AI projects in other companies. I'm far from an expert but those are expensive projects and could easily be perceived as \"not  essential in these trying times\" making said companies pause these projects, reducing yet again demand for NVDA's GPUs.\n\n\n\nAs I said, yes the stock has lost 50% in 2022 so some of the above has definitely been priced in.\n**What is going to drive demand for their products in such a way that they meet revenue and EPS targets? Let alone allow them to give upbeat guidance?** \n\n\n\n***Positions***: none so far, thinking about throwing a few grand into longer dated puts.\n\nCalling all devil advocates to come up with a bullish reasoning to spark discussion and gauge if the ship has sailed for this dumb gamble or the bearish reasoning does hold merit and is an educated guess that should net profits.\n\nHave a great NY and may our portfolios be green in 2023.",
