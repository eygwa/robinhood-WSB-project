    "selftext": "By now we should all be experts at realizing how powerful the fed is. Especially proven by the declines today (which will continue, slowly).\n\nAnd with Inflation flying, job growth is booming, GDP for the most part hitting its targets, and JPOW looking like he has aged 40 years.\n\nWe can assume that jpow is officially and finally losing access to his money printer. (bears are in control).\n\nThese should all be things you guys understand, no real big brain shit.\n\nHowever, How to make money off this is what separates the Retards from the Autists.\n\nI by no means have a crystal ball, but I would like to point out a few things that everyone should be thinking about when it comes to trying to make money in in 2022.\n\n1. Companies that live off of cheap debt are going to be crushed, examples: Doordash, and real estate companies - Zillow, and Blackstone.\n2. Banks are being handed a gift here, higher interest rates means banks can charge more in closing fees. Long WFC, BAC, MTB (they'll become more profitable, Revenues may reduce)\n3. Interest rates are rising, Which really means bond prices are falling. TYO, TTT and other short US treasury Etfs will absolutely kill it.\n4. Although all stocks will likely take hits, Companies like MSFT, T, FB and other monsters that have taken out cheap loans in 2021 to repurchase stock in 2022 will likely fare better than the rest. (TSLA, NFLX are not a monster in this way.)\n5. Its also my opinion that 2022 will be the year the fundamentals start to actually matter again as money becomes more scarce. TXRH is a $72 stock max.\n\nI'm only trying to help, pls dont rip me. I do \"work\" in finance (not financial advice, do your own DD).",

    "title": "Options Mechanics And Principles For Beginners",
    "selftext": "Title says it all. I'll keep this at a Barney-level of elementary so you guys can understand the content.\n\nI'm tired of seeing the \"stock went up but I still lost money. HELP!?!?!\" posts.\n\nComplicated concepts are just made up of smaller concepts.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n**Fundamentals I: The Basics)**\n\nAn option is the right but not the obligation (hence: option) to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock (the *underlying* asset) at a specified price (*strike price*) and expiration date.\n\n**A call is the right to buy 100 shares; a put is the right to sell 100 shares**\n\n**Intrinsic value:** Value of an option at expiration\n\n**Extrinsic value:** Value of an option at current price minus value of option at expiration (additional value derived from time and volatility rather than inherent, intrinsic value)\n\nIf you buy a $300c on $MSFT, and the stock gains $10, you gain $1000 of intrinsic value ($10 x 100) as long as the option is **in the money (ITM)**. ITM means that the option is above the strike price. The advantage is that an ITM option retains its value better, but is more expensive and offers less leverage per dollar, though has the same actual 100x leverage.\n\nIf the stock is BELOW (on the bad side of) the strike price, it is considered **out of the money (OTM)**. This means that the option is inherently worthless. The point of an OTM option is that it is cheaper, offers the same leverage, and has proportionately more leverage per dollar. The disadvantage is that it decays and loses value quickly if the stock goes down. Think *Feast or Famine.* **This is the spirit of WSB.**\n\n**At The Money (ATM)** means that the option is at or very near to the strike price of an option. If you couldn't extrapolate that the advantages/disadvantages of this option are between ITM and OTM, please stop reading and disable options access in your Robinhood account.\n\n**Fundamentals II: The Greeks)**\n\nThere are variables that describe the change in value of an option over time, volatility, and price. These are called \"The Greeks\". You don't have to memorize the exact definition, but you should know what each of them mean.\n\nIn actuality, there are at least 16 Greeks. First-order, second-order, and third-order to describe rate of change of rate of change of (nonsense). You don't have to know that many.\n\nHere are the main ones:\n\n**Delta: Change in option price per $1 change in the underlying stock**\n\n**Gamma: Change in option Delta per $1 change in the underlying stock**\n\n**Theta: Decay of an option price per day of passed time**\n\n**Vega: Change of an option's price per 1% change of implied volatility**\n\n**Rho: You don't need to know what this is. Option price change vs Interest rates. Barely matters. I'm including it because you autists use Robinhood and it's on there.**\n\n*Q: \"Why are these important?\"*\n\n*A: Because you can still lose money when a stock goes the \"right\" direction of your Delta, but Theta and Vega gut your option beyond profit. For example, earnings calls - Volatility drops intensely after the earnings call, and since both puts and calls have positive Vega, you will lose a LOT of value due to Vega.*\n\nTakeaway: Directionality is NOT enough to make profit off of an option. An ATM call or put has, on average, a 33% chance of profit.\n\nAlso, the Greeks are a very good yet imperfect representation of option prices. The Black-Scholes equation has limitations and makes some assumptions, but theoretical finance is beyond the scope of this write-up.\n\n**Fundamentals III: The Elusive Intelligent Play)**\n\nUnderstanding option mechanics is NOT enough to make intelligent moves. Shorting volatility on earnings is statistically positive, yet barely better than guessing even though it's the \"right\" move.\n\nTake, for example, an ATM TSLA call. Do you know what the profit trajectory looks like? It looks like this:\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/0v66erz6lub81.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c836cd1e16c2cfe7d381ebfb8e5cd7c25d028c2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people knew that this is what they were agreeing to when they bought an option, much fewer people would participate. OTM options are even worse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/thgxd8p9lub81.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa4141ceba39668a17bff67b94e7fdbcb117227)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nITM options are weaker, but still unimpressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ITM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/3632951blub81.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4948fe3971b48db878c229d28c3b48e7c590b04e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals IV: Turning a Profit)**\n\nSo what is an option good for? Luckily, if you are illegally using insider information, then options are a great choice to multiply your information advantage! If that doesn't apply to you, then you can use them as lottery tickets to scalp sharp price swings for the greatest amount of leverage possible.\n\nIf you expect slow but certain price movements, then you may prefer LEAPs, Margin, or Spreads.\n\nBeware leveraged ETFs: The max drawdown can offset profits. For example, a 10% drawdown turns into a 30% drawdown with 3x leverage. Your position goes from 100% to 70%. Upon regaining 10%, you regain 30%. Your position is now at 91% of its original value. Unless you have an infinite bank roll, losses are more severe than gains of equal magnitude.\n\nA 50% gain can be lost if you give back 33%\n\nA 50% loss can be recovered if you gain 100%\n\n**This is why overallocation in a zero-sum game will ultimately lead to $0, and it's easy to overallocate with leverage. This applies to every form of leverage and volatility. Granted, that's the spirit of wsb. This is why a casino will win with only a 51% advantage and also why they have max bets. You are facing off against insiders, analyst firms, and HFTs, all while you don't have an infinite bankroll, so your advantage is sub-50%.**\n\nThat being said, leveraged ETFs aren't terrible. Just be aware of the risk that are involved in it. Leveraged ETFs rebalance their leverage daily, whereas Margin leverage is not rebalanced. To put this into a simpler perspective, if a stock goes from $100 to $80 one day, and $80 to $100 the next, margin would return you to the original value whereas a leveraged ETF would return you to 96% of your original value. This is usually inconsequential, but over many many days of stagnant/sideways returns, this may add up.\n\n*Q: \"How do I turn a profit?\"*\n\nA: Get lucky, obtain an information advantage, or invest long-term to reap inflation &amp; appreciation\n\n*Q: \"How do I get an information advantage?\"*\n\nA: With hyper-autistic levels of DD, or befriend a senator/other insider.\n\n*Q: \"Okay thanks, that's everything\"*\n\nA: I'm glad you asked. An option spread is a combination of two or more options together to form a play. The advantages are that you can negate Theta, Vega, and even short volatility without having to sell naked (which is not an option on the Robinhood platform). You may recognize the term \"Box spread\" from a particular retard who made Robinhood change their terms and conditions.\n\nHere is an ATM call debit spread on TSLA ($1045c 1/21 buy, $1050c 1/21 sell for $258 entry $500 max profit):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL DEBIT SPREAD](https://preview.redd.it/3ylgs3rkoub81.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52f98cb900aae5264619f7bf8099040c1fede19)\n\nA 48% chance to almost double your money is much more in line with what most of you are looking for. Double $8k four times and you will have around $128k.\n\nAdvantages: Neutral theta (positive or negative depending on whether it's ITM or OTM), little to no Vega, very efficient leverage, cheap option spread (the pictured above only costs $258 to enter). You retain a lot of value near expiration if the stock is not going your way. Look at -2% from 2 days out on the above chart. You lose roughly half of your spread's value despite being OTM and very close to expiry. However, as I will mention again soon: The lower liquidity will likely make this a worse deal upon entry and exit.\n\nDisadvantages: Much less opportunity to scalp. Option is meant to expire to receive full value, so you're usually riding the option until it's dead. On rare occasions, the ITM option you sold may be exercised, but your broker is supposed to take care of this for you. There is less liquidity, so you will have a harder time entering and exiting trades at fair prices since you're eating liquidity two times upon entry, and two times upon exit (if you choose to exit at any point). And, most importantly, there is less overall leverage. There is not a linear leverage like options with infinite gains; your gains are capped with a max gain and max loss. Though Risk/Reward is superior, the maximum possible reward is inferior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYOLO $TSLA 1150c 1/21",

Here is in detail.\n\nI've been on this sub almost year, one of those who a meme stock attracted and I knew pretty much nothing.  Since then, made some gains, made some losses, slowly declining until I was over 50% down. I traded pretty much every meme through August though only in piddly amounts, a few shares at most (Robinhood is my play account, I do most of my serious investing in Fidelity) and more or less staying even through most of 2021.\n\nOver time I found the real DD was in the comments, how to ignore the pumpers and dumpers, even read a book or two on options and trading. Lots of youtube videos too.\n\nAugust I started trading SPY calls and had some successes with small amounts of safe calls.\n\nI get cocky and buy 30K in SPY short expiration calls at the end of August, and September 2021 hits my port very hard. I sell for a loss, and had been clawing my way back up to break even, when I saw the news about ATVI's scandal and the stock dropped. I had sworn not to gamble on individual stocks anymore or FD's or expiration calls less than 6 months to expiration, but ATVI news for some reason caught my eye.\n\nNovember 3rd 2021 it closed at $66.25 down from a previous $79.29 and for days it stayed down. I decided to buy 1 call on November 16th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[And regretted it within days.](https://preview.redd.it/nydickqvphc81.png?width=486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed66ee41c31a540897b1976f9a3e17c41a8fc61)\n\nI've been addicted to video games since I was a preschooler dragged kicking and screaming by my Dad from his friend's house where I encountered my first Pong game. I figured, they'll do damage control, they are a juggernaut  in the industry, they'll pretend things have changed, the sentiment will change when people get distracted by other things like Theranos and the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. I think the culture does need to change in the industry, but I also figured this scandal would be like demilitarizing Japan. What do their schoolbooks say happened back then? Sorry if it sounds cynical.\n\nIn fact, I think I'll by a couple more!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ I still think I'm on to something, so I buy a couple more contracts.](https://preview.redd.it/1ql3ru8oqhc81.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e8b5c05374f1ffd4e2475d73eaed2a311c6074)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There would be some news about changes being made, people being punished possibly, and I kept thinking, it'll shoot back up.

Not long ago, the bank reportedly said it was \"extremely bullish\" on commodities and sees a possible decade-long supercycle.\n\nDanske Bank: Fed expected to raise rates 4 times this year, start tapering in September\n\nIf the U.S. economy develops in line with expectations, the Fed may raise interest rates for the first time in March, supported by a tight labor market and still-high inflation. The number of Fed rate hikes this year is expected to increase from three to four (in March, June, September and December, respectively), with each hike of 25 basis points. In addition, it is expected to start tapering in September. Given the strong economy and higher underlying inflation, we believe the risk of tightening tends to increase rather than decrease.\n\nBank of America Survey: Investors reduce net position in technology sector to lowest level since December 2008\n\nBank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey for January showed that fund managers' net allocations to the technology sector fell 20% sequentially to 1%, the lowest level since 2008. They expect inflation levels to fall this year and are betting on a record overall boom in commodities and equities. In addition, a monthly survey conducted by Deutsche Bank found that most respondents believe U.S. technology stocks are in a bubble, as investors remain very pessimistic about the Fed's hawkish turn and rising U.S. bond yields.\n\nHot News\n\nStar Tech Stocks Weak in Pre-Market, Nvidia, Tesla Down More Than 2%\n\nAs of writing, $Nvidia ([NVDA.US](https://nvda.us/))$ and $Tesla ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ are down over 2% premarket, while $Meta Platforms ([FB.US](https://fb.us/))$, $Amazon ([AMZN.US](https://amzn.us/))$, $Microsoft ([MSFT.US](https://msft.us/))$, $Apple ([AAPL.US](https://aapl.us/))$ and $Google-A ([GOOGL.US](https://googl.us/))$ are down over 1%.\n\nAnti-epidemic stocks lower in pre-market, BioNTech down more than 6%\n\nAs of press time, $BioNTech ([BNTX.US](https://bntx.us/))$ is down over 6% premarket, $Moderna ([MRNA.US](https://mrna.us/))$, $Novavax Pharmaceuticals ([NVAX.US](https://nvax.us/))$, $Ocugen ([OCGN.US](https://ocgn.us/))$ are down over 3%, and $Pfizer ([PFE.US](https://pfe.us/))$ is down nearly 1%.\n\nGoldman Sachs$ Q4 net revenue of $12.64 billion, down more than 4% pre-market\n\n$ Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://gs.us/))$ reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $12.64 billion, fourth-quarter investment banking revenue of $3.6 billion, fourth-quarter trading revenue of $3.99 billion, fourth-quarter equity sales and trading revenue of $2.12 billion, and fourth-quarter fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities sales and trading revenue of $1.86 billion.

    "title": "Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts",
    "selftext": " **Microsoft - Activision Blizzard Deal Thoughts**\n\n*Originally posted on my* [blog](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2022/01/19/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-thoughts/)*. Disclosure: I am long Activision Blizzard and Microsoft.*\n\nBig news in the gaming world. Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI) in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion (net of cash $68b), or $95 per share . This is the largest gaming industry acquisition ever, which crushed the previous record established last week when Take Two bought Zynga for $11 billion. The deal is also Microsoft\u2019s biggest ever.\n\nMicrosoft offered a 45% premium. This is a hefty premium compared to where ATVI traded in recent months, but ATVI traded at higher prices one year ago (52-week high $104). The recent scandals have hurt ATVI.\n\nAt the moment, ATVI trades \\~$82 per share. This implies that the market is skeptical that the deal will close. There\u2019s an arbitrage opportunity here. If the deal goes through, it offers a 16% upside. ATVI also distributes a small dividend once a year. Let\u2019s discuss this arbitrage opportunity. .\n\nDisclosure: I am long ATVI and Microsoft. I\u2019ve been a shareholder of both companies before the announcement. I\u2019m pleased with the offer. I\u2019m biased. I don\u2019t see the risk the market does and that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s not the capacity to pay. Microsoft has the cash and won\u2019t dilute shareholders. So it sounds like possible antitrust issues. Is there anything else I\u2019m missing?\n\nHere\u2019s a brief background on both companies:\n\n**Activision Blizzard**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the company behind blockbuster games like Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo is going through a rough patch, to say the least. I\u2019m not going to rehash everything that happened (years of sexual harassment, discrimination, and misconduct). But what happened and how it was handled is business/PR 101 on what not to do.\n\nATVI\u2019s reputation is damaged. Talent is leaving. There\u2019s probably more skeletons in the closet. Bobby Kotick built a great company, great games, and rewarded shareholders very well along the way. But Kotick mismanaged the crisis and lost the trust of the gamers, public, employees, and the market. We don\u2019t have the full story. I suspect more internal problems, more culture and development issues with games. And it\u2019s not just the scandal, ATVI has made some missteps in the past.\n\nThe thing is the scandal would have followed the company for a long time. These things don\u2019t go away easily. The media and the Internet will keep bringing up. And if you underperform operationally, game quality and growth is affected, the pressure will just keep going up. Your culture might be so tainted that gamers don\u2019t want to be associated with your games. A crisis like that would have taken years to fix and in the process possibly lose your competitiveness and sales. Who knows if the stock would ever recover.\n\nWith this background, I understand why ATVI accepted the $95 cash offer. It\u2019s probably better that ATVI is under a different home. Fix the issues away from the public. It\u2019s been reported that Kotick will leave if and once the deal closes. In a sense it gives him a graceful exit.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\nMicrosoft has been making a lot of deals lately. WSJ reported that MSFT had long been interested in ATVI and had discussed a potential acquisition in the past.\n\nIf you are going to spend $75 billion for a business, you have big plans. It\u2019s also telling of their gaming ambitions. For the last ten years MSFT has been boosting their gaming portfolio.\n\nFor the last ten years Microsoft has been boosting their gaming assets. Microsoft has been working on building the \u201cNetflix\u201d of gaming. A subscription based cloud gaming service. Cloud gaming is an emerging technology that allows people to stream games via nearly any internet-connected device (issue is that game requires a lot of data to run smoothly). And because Microsoft owns Azure, they have the cloud infrastructure to support such a strategy.\n\nThe strategy is to persuade gamers to abandon their expensive hardware and play on the cloud. If Microsoft could convert some of Activision\u2019s close to 400 million monthly active users into subscribers, it could significantly bolster its cloud-game business.\n\n**Issues**\n\nI believe it comes down to antitrust. But because I\u2019m set to benefit I don\u2019t fully see the risk the market does. John Hempton from Bronte Capital brought up some of the same issues on a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_Hempton/status/1483540883333324802). But I don\u2019t see anything substantial in the Twitter comments. I share some of his views. Here\u2019s what I think and please let me know what I don\u2019t see:\n\n* Is there a precedent where the Gov/Justice Department/FTC blocked a gaming transaction?\n* The deal is not expected to close for a while (ATVI Fiscal 2023) but that is still a big gap.\n* I think the #1 factor is Lina Khan, the chair of the FTC. She\u2019s been very vocal about taking on big tech. She\u2019s writing papers about. That\u2019s why she got the job. The 32-year-old antitrust scholar and law professor is not Microsoft\u2019s ally.\n* This deal poses an important test of the Biden Administration\u2019s generally unfriendly view of large technology acquisitions.\n* However, from a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other big tech (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google).\n* Microsoft will pay a $3 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn\u2019t go through. This indicates to me that they are confident the deal will go through.\n* The games will need to be on multiple platforms (Playstation, PC, Nintendo, mobile etc\u2026). If not it\u2019s a deal breaker. The deal won\u2019t get approved and you will get a gamer mutiny. And gamers are crazy.\n* Keeping the games multi-platform also makes business sense. If you fence off Call of Duty to only Xbox, you will kill part of the gamer community and hurt the branding. If you pay $75b you want to see some returns at the end of the day.\n* If these get hairy they might have to sell a couple titles.\n* I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much concentration. In terms of gaming sales (excluding hardware) Microsoft is #4. Tencent, Sony and Apple have more gaming revenues. ATVI is #7. The deal will make Microsoft the third largest gaming company in terms of revenue.\n\nI think the deal will go through. Let\u2019s hear other views and why.\n\nBrian",

Right now it's probably the best time to invest in some more or less adequate small cap companies that are targeting for growth. Do your DD, there's a plenty.\n\nLarge caps are being corrected these days. The big tech sell off is the ultimate reason why S&amp;P and NASDAQ are pointing down, since big tech was pulling major indexes up in 2021.

    "title": "Missed the NFLX ER? A look at upcoming earnings - MSFT, TSLA, INTC, AAPL, HOOD and V.",
    "selftext": "Missed the $NFLX ER? You and everyone else is currently looking at the next $NFLX like earnings play. One thing is for sure, tech earnings will be volatile and results at the tail end will be more likely than usual. Tail ends are usually hard to predict and the statistic models that calculate premiums usually underestimate them. So it might be the best time to steal from thetagang.\n\nThat said, I think we'll see two types of tech ER scenarios going forward. Type 1 will be a $NFLX repeat, taking everyone by surprise. More likely will be type 2, everyone is getting scared and the stock tanks before ER and goes up after or stays flat. \n\nLet's look at next week, afaik all of these are after hours:\n\n**Tuesday -  $MSFT**\n\n\nDown 13.5% from ATH (historically a lot for Microsoft). \n\nP/E is 33.11, EPS is in a healthy uptrend (P/E - price / earnings, EPS - earnings per share).\n\nI think this will be type 2: will tank like the rest of the market before Tues, but the actual ER will be fine. Might even be a good idea to go long on this.\n\n**Wednesday - $TSLA $INTC $NOW**\n\n\nThat's where it gets real interesting. Tesla. P/E at an astronomical 306, that is, it is priced for high growth. Everyone already expects a super bullish $TSLA ER, the slightest hint at growth problems and it might tank spectacularily. Elon is currently also down on gambling with company funds on \ud83c\udf3d, but its probably not gonna be significant enough of a loss. \n\nI preface this that anyone betting against Elon is already bankrupt, but I think this could be a type 1, given that there is a chance for guidance and growth expectations to be lowered. They will probably still beat earnings for the quarter though, as they beat their delivery goals. Downside is that puts will be expensive and only pay out on a large enough move.\n\nThen there also Intel reporting on Wednesday, $INTC is a boomer shit stock that likes to drop on earnings as well. P/E is currently at 10 though. The current market seems to punish high P/E companies more than low P/E companies. While we wouldn't expect much growth with a P/E this low, at 10 we could also say that Intel is a value stock currently and there's better tech stocks to go short on.\n\nServiceNow ($NOW) also is one of these P/E high flyers. Trailing P/E of 90.99 (so averaged over 12 months). Based on the last ER some sites report as high as a 466.29 P/E, but obviously that may be wildly off if their earnings are a bit more seasonal. But I've seen forward estimates over 100 as well. They have a product for companies for tracking and managing business procedures. I haven't used it but seems it overall NOW seems to track and correlate a lot with SPY.  \n\n**Thursday - $AAPL, $HOOD, $V, $TEAM**\n\n\n\n$AAPL - P/E ratio 28 and EPS in healthy uptrend. Q4 is also a really strong quarter for them usually. Not enough conviction to go long on this one yet, on the other hand I also wouldn't short it. But its likely going to be a Type 2. If it drops some more, BTFD might be a good idea.\n\n$HOOD seems like the obvious short, given that they are losing money left and right. But they are already down 80% from their highs so I think there might be not enough meat on the bone left. Maybe it even squeezes, if they can guide higher due to higher Q1 volatility. If thats what makes them earn more money. It's still an absolute POS stock. If it goes up after ER, that would be a good time to short it.\n\n$V - P/E 36.60\n\nVisa is down 11% from a July 2021 ATH. Financial companies have been under pressure for some time. For me a boomer company, not likely to have an outsized earnings reaction, but who knows maybe this was the non obvious one to go down.\n\n$TEAM - Trailing P/E 187.9. Down 38% from ATH.\n\nThis might fit the bill for a bloated company that got boosted by WFH and covid. Maybe there's still some downside left if the report is bad. Atlassian is mostly known for the dev/wiki like platform everyone hates, Confluence.\n\nDisclaimer: I have no positions in any of the mentioned companies at this time. Should $AAPL and/or $MSFT go down more before ER, I might think about going long shares/calls. For a lotto ticket I'd go with $TSLA OTM puts, still not sure if I really want to bet against Elon and will do more DD. $TEAM and $NOW could also be candidates for going short.\n\nEdit: added $TEAM and $NOW to the list.\n\nTook no positions.\n\nHow the predictions turned out so far:\n\nMSFT up | was up nicely next day\n\nTSLA down |  ~~flat AH~~ down next day\n\nNOW down | +10% next day\n\nINTC maybe slightly down | ~~slightly down AH~~ down next day\n\nAAPL up | up AH\n\nHOOD no idea, maybe squeeze | ~~down~~ squeeze next day\n\nV no idea | nicely up next day\n\nTEAM down | up AH, up next day",

People are balls deep in mortgage payments, and those who got in late is even more screwed.\n\nmetaVerse - a pandemic by product - too early to tell how to monetize this space. You can tell companies have been doing this, CS GO - skins, Diablo 3 - marketplace. These have not taken off in any dramatic way so we can gauge consumer sentiment to spend money in a virtual reality.\n\nAI innovations- this would be deflation.\n\nSPY top holdings are BIG TECH. Big tech was the major theme of the pandemic hedge which ended up being great winners. Re-opening is a negative for all these companies and the pandemic is basically over after this year.\n\nThe thing trading at 35k right now. This that have no value, is speculation. Speculation ends up being a bubble. EVEN if this thing is the next best thing, we are too early. All this cheap money finding new ideas to generate an ungodly P/L is basically, a matter bubble.\n\nWarren Buffett - ATH cash holdings. Going to wait out for the market to kick out the froth.\n\nChina - Imposing tons of new regulations to soften their markets, whether it be RE market (tax on developers), big tech (listing and fines, all regulations), ensuring the COMMON prosperity can continue (most China markets are/were already inflated before this initiative was introduced). China is basically a step ahead of the US Feds in controlling their economic cycles.\n\nRead this, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp), then reflect on life around you, then read it again.

    "selftext": "Baba is tanking still, revenue is 0.14% of total marketcap per year on trailing 12 month for gross profit, which continues to ratchet up. Revenue growth is 30%, with even higher cloud computing growth, which does well during a downturn as capex is lower for the cloud.  China has a growing tech sector due to 1.2 population growth per women, so they need to get out of manufacturing and into high tech sectors.\n\nI dont know whats going on with this, but should BABA not be the poster child of this sub, as far as high risk high return?  Its making enough to justify its market cap, 100% more than MSFT relative to marketcap, and growth is higher.\n\nIf you want to yolo like an autist I dont see anything better.  This value comes around but once in a lifetime, if it keeps going up 30% nobody will care if Xi takes a dump on Baba's desk.",

No one could have seen a day like this coming.\n\nNow i did anticipate a bull trap this week but i did NOT see this coming or a bulltrap in this way. \n\nAt sessions lows today we saw a crazy low of 420.79 and we just closed at a high of 439.72 up 0.4%... thats over a 4.3% swing in one day \ud83d\ude31.\n\nNow where the heck do we go from here? And what can we expect the rest of the week? \n\nOn the 30 min at the absolute low of the day at 420 we saw the RSI well oversold at 16 only to finish near\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sCy4mKJ.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/X7BkZM1.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EMiqmGJ.jpeg\n\nWhat does that mean? We MAY see another sell off come tomorrow. The 30 min RSI on the recovery has usually sold off once it hits &gt;60. We will need to watch that tomorrow. \n\nNow on the daily we have a little more clearer picture of where we are and where we are going. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/hKUCvZG.jpeg\n\nWe have a couple things to look at... we finished ABOVE the daily 200 ema which is now at 438.92. Overall that bullish.\n\nWe had a HUGE morning gap on the daily which has now been filled thanks to this recovery. \n\nWe also have a massive green hammer candle on the daily bouncing off the bottom of the channel (light green dotted... on the daily it shows we broke channel but on 30 min we actually fell short... its a webull chart issue). Usually this signals a recovery is coming and the bottom is in. However look back at the hammer candle on 1/9. We saw lower after. \n\n\nSupports to watch- 438.92 (daily 200 ema- which we just dipped below in the after market) --&gt; 430.4 --&gt; 420.76 --&gt; 416.7\n\nResistance to watch- 440.4 --&gt; 447.8 --&gt; 451. \n\n417 is the bottom of the green dotted channel and 451 is the top. We are pretty much right in the middle right now. We could go either way.\n\nIBM just posted their earnings and are positively being reacted to after hours right now. This could help push the markets green till more big tech releases this week.\n\nWe have msft tuesday, tesla Wednesday and apple Thursday. \n\nToday was a Rollercoaster and i forced trades and burnt myself. Gonna take tomorrow to regroup and retackle this tomorrow.",

    "title": "Rate hikes and how it affects stocks - Watching for FED (GRRR...no more BRRR)",
    "selftext": " Lets do a simple analysis here.\n\nTake the popular stock AAPL - PE is \\~28 at current price $163. Investors were willing to pay up to $182 for 1 share of this company at low interest rates environment. PE at 182 would have been \\~32. In other words earnings per 1$ of investment here would yield 1/32 = 3.125%. Now lets assume interest rates goes up one percentage due to FED hike. Its natural this causes a ripple effect in way banks lend, finance, bond markets etc...naturally investors will demand 1% more return from stocks as well (this is for debate I know). So lets say investors want 4.125% now, which would equate to PE of 1/.04125 = \\~24. Hence prices would need to come down by 25% (24/32) from ATH to make this feasible which equates to $136. Now lets say AAPL has 5% earnings growth (projection is actually less from analysts for 2022 - source Schwab), price would go up to 136\\*1.05 = $143 by end of 2022.....2023 with another 1% rate hike and similar growth...it would go down further, unless earnings blow past expectations.\n\nUsing the same method we can say SPY would get to $360 by end of year due to rate adjustment, with 10% earnings growth, this could get to 396. Nasdaq is another story probably worse, as there are high PE speculative stocks as part of that as well.\n\nSample reference for PE vs interest rates: [https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-understanding-the-relationship-between-rates-and-p-e-ratios](https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-understanding-the-relationship-between-rates-and-p-e-ratios)\n\nNow, big investors expecting this, would naturally collect profits and move to stable dividend stocks (SCHD, Energy etc) is my guess. Since big money moves, this could be worse than what it actually should be, due to panic selling......\n\n**Tldr: end of year SPY target is $370....could be slow bleed. My play is to keep watching and add money to funds and attractive stocks (MSFT, CRM...) as it goes lower. I am here for 25+ year horizon...so can withstand some years of pain. Look at 2000, it took slow bleeding....and 13 years to get back to ATH SPY price, but with DCA this may not look that bad.**\n\nI may be wrong completely IF THE RATE HIKES WERE PRICED IN TO $480 ATH prices, which I really doubt given the way the markets are reacting. **Also, balance sheet tapering is not considered above. Worst case SPY could go to low 300's or upper 200's, based on few other analysis I did, best case if retail keeps pumping the dip, could get to low 400's.**\n\nLooking for feedback here in terms of the following below (no emotions please, I am simply trying to analyze here):\n\n\\--&gt; assumptions on interest rate rise vs stock returns - provide alternative argument if you don't agree\n\n\\--&gt; how do we know if markets priced in rate hikes...even if it did...balance sheet tapering was not...how to account for that? how much more PE should come down...?\n\n\\--&gt; if you are bullish with SPY getting to $480 and above, please provide alternative thesis other than market being irrational, because its not...",

As a result, the vampires will have to return to their coffins to contemplate their next moves.\n\nThese relentless vampire attacks come as a result of ultrasophisticated algorithm programs that nickel &amp; dime a stock to death with naked short sales until the proverbial rug is removed from under the feet of a stock allowing it to go into free-fall.\n\nNow that most of the blood from the cannabis sector and some MEME stocks have been sucked nearly completely dry, vampire short sellers have their eyes set on new - much fatter - targets. Namely, FAANG stocks +1 ($MSFT). These naked vampire short sellers successfully punctured their fangs into Amazon and Netflix. After they are done emaciating Amazon and Netflix, they will (at the very least) attempt to repeat their success with an attack on Apple, Facebook/Metaverse and Google. Why? As the famous bank robber Willie Sutton once responded when asked why he robbed banks, Sutton replied, \"Because that's where the money is.\"\n\nF - Facebook/Metaverse ($FB)\n\nA - Apple ($AAPL)\n\nA - Amazon ($AMZN) **\ud83d\udca5**\n\nN - Netflix ($NFLX) **\ud83d\udca5**\n\nG - Google/Alphabet ($GOOG)\n\n*Plus 1: Microsoft ($MSFT)*\n\n$AMZN: Vampire short sellers have already gotten their teeth tightly clenched on Amazon which, just yesterday, closed below the **\"Death Cross\"** \\- that's when a stock's 50-day moving average crosses and closes below its 200-day moving average.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98gyemf242e81.png?width=1481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e362ba523fab7b1ace0e32ab8cb45acb0b9967b0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$NFLX: Vampire short sellers have pushed Netflix **below** its **200-day** moving average.

    "selftext": "Note- my posts maybe on the later sides some day cause I'm off work with covid and home with the family till i go back to work. I may head back to work finally monday. If i do i may not always post every night if i am too busy before work. I work night shift so sometime during the night though i will post. Just know once i get back to work full time i wont post as much unfortunately. \n\nAnyways lets get into it! \n\nTo me today was a confirmation day. I fully expected after market and futures wise that we woulda started the day down 1-2% not up 1.5% i believe it was. Nonetheless today was a very telling day in my opinion. What we saw today was a retest of the upper limit of this downward bearish channel we have been trading in since January 3rd. Look at the green dotted channel on the 30 minute. It has developed some very strong resistance now with from January 3rd to present being touched and officially rejected 4 times and 2 other times where it nearly touched the line. Thats a very stout resistance line that if we ever break it should provide some very heavy upward movement. https://i.imgur.com/bBk4yhZ.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8iDmj1m.jpeg\n\nWhat i watched develop this morning intraday (always watching the 30 min) was the MACD turning from buy to sell AND most importantly as we neared the top of the channel at the time of 441.5 was that the RSI was around 63. To me that showed that this did not have the momentum to break through. When we rejected the 441.5 twice i bought some 2/4 440P and 339p and one 1/28 440p... all three played very heavily. I got greedy and missed some gains though when we broke 430 for a second but recovered to 433 before market close. I was looking for the bottom drop and never got it. Left some on the table but still paid out &gt;50% for all 3.  Not bad at all. \n\nThings im watching for tomorrow is Apple crushing earnings and being up 5% after hours. Now apple can NOT hold the market up on its own as much as people like to think it can. However oddly enough once apple released cry*pto pulled outta its nose dive and spy went from red to green. However, take tesla for instance today... tesla was down 5% while spy was up nearly 2% and tesla finished down 11%. Even the otherday on Tuesday Microsoft was up while the market was down if i remember correctly (or inverse). Either way what im saying is one company will not hold the market up. Though apple is the first big top 10 to release a stellar earnings so some sentiment may change... just keep in mind after and pre market are easily skewed by retail... tesla today was up right until the market open then we saw the true hedgefund take... \n(side note i bet tesla starts its decline down to 500-600 now... tesla today once again broke 25% correction from highs... the market FINALLY sees tesla as over valued and i think we see them take a fairly big hit down. Once this does it will finish our correction of spy and nasdaq to total of 25%... i think msft and apple will maintain their valuations). \n\nSo onto tomorrow what should we suspect? \n\nWell interestingly after hours on my chart (some webull users say they did not see this on theirs). I saw a massive spike up to again fall just short of the green dotted resistance line. \n\n30 min macd did turn to buy. Rsi is curling upward and leaving room for another run at this resistance line. Though i doubt we break it. My anticipation is tomorrow we test that resistance line early morning again near 439-440 and then dip after again. \n\nWe saw extremely strong support today near 430. We DID break it very quickly but the buy pressure was too much. This is our fight zone. 430 and 440. One thing i am seeing is we have moved so far upward in this green dotted channel that unless we see some massive sell off days despite being bearish long term we will break it. However 2 or 3 days of nothing but sell offs (which we have not seen any days of just pure red this week will push us low enough to stay in the channel). Realistically we need a red day to finish down 1-2% in order to stay in this channel. And honestly we are kinda due for one. Im shocked that both today and yesterday stopped short of only about 0.5-1% down.\n\nSupports intraday- 429.5 --&gt; 425 --&gt; 420.76 \nResistance intraday- 434.5 --&gt; 440 --&gt; breakout\n\nSupport-\n-1%=427\n-2%= 422.6\n-3%= 418.3 \n\nResistance-\n+1%=435.6\n+2%= 439.8\n+3% 444.17\n\nLooking at the % up and down we can go its interesting that being up 2% tomorrow still keeps us in this bearish channel. Now mind you as time progresses the channel progresses with the chart so towards end of day tomorrow the upper limit of the channel will probably be closer to 438 or so...  i really am surprised we have not sold off yet to touch that 420 support area we saw this week... and i think maybe tomorrow could be the day it happens. \n\nOverall the chart and sentiment is still bearish. If and when we break this green dotted channel i will consider whether or not we are bullish. There is another resistance line up near 460 we have to break in order to see a full recovery breakout.",

    "title": "SPY vs. QQQ for daily options trading",
    "selftext": "Alright so ive been exclusively trading SPY options since last year, however, i recently stumbled upon an article explaining how QQQ has an advantage over SPY when it comes to options trading... i did some testing and im kinda surprised to see the results. \n\nSo lets break this down and im open for people's opinions here... \n\nSPYs top 10 holdings are apple, msft, google, amazon, berkshire, j&amp;j, p&amp;g and nvidia which those top 10 holdings make up 28% of its total asset weight.\n\nQQQs top 10 holdings are apple, msft, google, amazon, tesla, nividia, paypal and adobe which those 10 make up 56% of its total asset weight. \n\nSo comparatively its safe to say QQQ is easily swayed by its top 10 holdings while SPY isnt necessarily. Which accounts for why QQQ will usually move more in one day than SPY. \n\nSomething else i wanted to compare was IV and overall gains/ losses. \n\nSo lets take February 11th as an expiration. Say we take the next OTM call option for both spy and qqq for yesterday and compare them... \nSPY $450C had a premium of $6.17 at end of day and would have returned 50.12% gains. \nWhile QQQ $364C had a premium of $6.19 at end of day but would have returned 120.39% gains.\nThats nearly triple the gains... \nIts noted the spread on the QQQ call was 0.10 while SPY was only 0.05. \n\nNow assume we were wrong and we bought the next otm put. \nSPY $449p is $7.02 and would have returned -41%. \nQqq $363P is $7.42 and returned -49.5%. \n\nSo had you been wrong you would have only lost 8.5% more but had you been right itd been 2.5x the gains for roughly the same premium. \n\nSpy volume- 152.5M\nQqq volume- 94.3M\n\n\nSo this leads me to the question. Is QQQ actually better when it comes to options trading than SPY?",

The Colonial Pipeline attack resulted in a $5million bitcorn ransom being paid to the hackers and  6 US states as well as Washington D.C. experiencing fuel shortages. **The Colonial Pipeline cyberattack was committed by  only 1 Russian amateur hacker group; meaning a concerted cyberattack by Russia government forces alongside multiple Russian hacker groups would be far more damaging.**\n\n**Russian Gov hackers pulled off the massive SolarWinds hack in which \"**[**The Pentagon, CIA, FBI, nuclear labs and Fortune 500 companies use software that was found to have been compromised by Russian hackers.\"**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/us/politics/russia-hack-nsa-homeland-security-pentagon.html)\n\nMSFT President Brad Smith called SolarWinds [\"the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20210215110722/https://www.politico.eu/article/solarwinds-largest-cyberattack-ever-microsoft-president-brad-smith/)\n\nRemember, SolarWinds was unprovoked, so a Russian Cyberattack as retaliation for sanctions will likely be much more vicious.\n\nGiven the US is offering to export more natural gas to the EU to offset Russia I'd expect cyberattacks focused on energy and other vital utilities ([Federal agencies and cybersecurity experts hold this opinion).](https://archive.md/ScmSl) **A utilities hack would seriously worsen our supply chain issues &amp; cause inflation to rise even further (to say nothing of the fear the stock market would experience as the attacks happen).**\n\n# Why China will probably help with these cyberattacks\n\n[China is already constantly committing 'brazen' cyber espionage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLo-mzEQgWc&amp;list=WL&amp;index=1&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision) against the US according to FBI.\n\nI doubt China will commit 100% of their cyber capabilites to the attack but China is backing Russia in Ukraine &amp; during Putin's Feb 4 Beijing visit: \"A **joint statement on international relations entering a new era** has been prepared for the talks,\" [Kremlin's top foreign policy adviser Ushakov told reporters, adding that it will reflect](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/02/kremlin-says-china-will-back-russia-on-security-at-games-talks-a76242) **Moscow &amp; Beijing's \"common views\" on security** among other issues.\n\nThe US couldn't initiate  a major trade war/sanctions against China because we are dependent on them for so much, especially **rare earth metals which are required for EVs &amp; tech**. [**Russia &amp; China produce 73% of total rare earth metals and China alone processes 87% of the world's supply.**](https://ibb.co/C9p29g9) **\\^**Link also shows **China is the #1 processor of: Lithium, Cobalt, copper, and nickel. Myanmar,** [a Chinese client state](https://thediplomat.com/2013/01/chinas-myanmar-problem/)**, produces 11%, so Sino-Russian global rare earth production is 84%.**\n\nChina would also have plausible deniability given the range of indirect support they could provide (revealing some US and EU cyber vulnerabilities they've discovered to the Russians, etc.)\n\nThese cyberattacks are also likely to happen because NATO wouldn't be able to retaliate: they'll have already sanctioned Russia and no one is going to start a nuclear war over a cyberattack.\n\nSpecifically a potential for ransomware attacks against small growth companies because cybersecurity is comparatively expensive for small companies; and if they're a research-focused company they'd be extremely easy to blackmail with ransomware: \"Oh you're a biotech firm? We've locked all your computers and we'll delete everything if you don't pay us $\\_\\_ Million dollars within 72hrs\".\n\n[Closing quote from CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-gamble-ukraine), the world's #1 Geopolitics journal:\n\n\" In 2017, a **Russian cyberattack** called \u201cNotPetya\u201d against Ukrainian private companies spread to computers and servers worldwide, **causing billions of dollars of damage**.

    "selftext": "I know, the acquisition is an old story. But hear me out.\n\nWe all know, MSFT proposed to acquire ATVI at $95 per share before FY 2023. However, ATVI is current locked below $80 for extended period of time. There\u2019s only one single reason for such huge price difference, the fear of regulatory intervention. \n\nFrom a financial point of view, the biggest all-cash acquisition certainly guarantees antitrust investigation. Even more so if you only consider the console market, as US personale usually do. But if you know gaming industry, as most apes do, it\u2019s easy to conclude that the deal will ultimately go through without much fuzz, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The post acquisition Microsoft will only be the third biggest gaming company across all platforms behind Sony and Tecent. \n2. Gaming industry is highly fragmental in nature. The combined revenue of Microsoft and Activision are only in the middle teen of the whole gaming market including console, PC and the fragmental mobile gaming. \n3. Microsoft has promised to honoured all past cross platform deals. Antitrust based on pure speculation doesn\u2019t holds water.\n4. An argument could be made in the metaverse angle. But let's be realistic, no way FTC or the justice department could capitalize on something that no one knows what it is. \n    \nIn conclusion, there\u2019s no real antitrust angle. The deal will go through. Worst case scenario, the deal break. Still not a big deal since ATVI at $79 is running at 24 PE, compared to their main competition's 60 (EA) and 36 (TTWO).\n\nThere isn\u2019t any yolo potential. But ATVI is an ideal diversification in a tumbling market.",

    "title": "If You Cannot Beat Them, Join Them - Congress Trading &amp; Retail Traders",
    "selftext": "Just wrote a blog post at [Tradytics](https://tradytics.com) and thought it's worth sharing here to let retail know what's going on.\n\n2021 was a great year for the market as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  rallied about 25%, which is significantly more than its average yearly  return. Many traders made money, but there was one group that made more  than most of us, and that was the group of US politicians. In 2012, the [STOCK ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)  was introduced to prevent the members of congress from using any  insider information to make trades, and require them to report their  trades within 45 days.\n\nWe are not sure how much is the rule followed these days by the members  of congress, but what we have seen over the last few years is how well  members of congress have been doing [extremely well](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/)  in terms of their performance in the markets. This could either be just  a coincidence, or they have more information than an average Joe.  Whatever the case is, the purpose of this post is to help retail traders  follow the congress trades to also earn profits like them.\n\n## Congress Trades\n\nSince the STOCK ACT requires the members of congress to report their  trades within 45 days, we want to find a way we can  leverage those trades to find some edge in the markets. As soon as a new  trade by one of the members of congress is reported, we publish it in our [Congress Market Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-market) shown below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h8rtk99wig81.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e51c5f81c661c86a30c88466de8495d93de2d06\n\nThis is every single trade that gets reported - one way we can think  about leveraging them is by simply taking the same trade. However, there  are a couple of issues there. First, not all members of the congress  outperform the market indices every year, only a few do. Second, these  trades are delayed by upto 45 days. Sometimes, the stock might have  already made a big move when they are reported, we want to be careful of  that. Finally, different amounts of money are spent on these trades,  and we want to weight them accordingly. The screenshot below shows the  top trades made by congressmen and women - millions of dollars going  into a trade should signify that these people are very confident in  their trades, and we should be okay in following them. Keeping these  limitations in mind, we try to solve them and end up with a solution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr1g8bjawig81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bc86ed2285efa280d2150ce35de73d9c40735e5\n\n## Congress ETF\n\nLooking at the historical data, we came up with a few observations.  First, many congress trades have a long time period i.e congressmen and  women do not enter into trades and exit immediately. This fixes the  issue of the 45 day delay although it does impact us somewhat in case  the stock has already made a big move before the report. Second, there  are many smaller trades and it is hard to use them well. When  significant money is being put into a trade, we want to weigh it more,  as it provides us more confidence. Finally, we want to be able to update  our picks as new data comes in. Based on these three observations, we  developed what we call a [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf) that combines congress trades in an intelligent manner and outperforms SPY.\n\nAt every day, the congress ETF takes the top 100 trades based on  their value and assigns them weights proportional to the amount that  went into the trade. The weights of the symbols are considered their  allocation, and it changes every day as new trades come in. Sold  positions are automatically removed from the ETF once they are reported.  Based on this dynamic allocation of symbols, we construct an ETF called  Congress ETF. Before diving into more details, let us first take a look  at the performance of the ETF and compare it to SPY.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5wuo8tbwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3bf4d88e81dd63240369cb6745e87b17c50934\n\nLooking at the chart above, we can see that the Congress ETF outperforms [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) by a factor of 2, which means it's twice as good as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY). If you've traded for a while, you would know that beating the markets i.e [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  is not an easy job, especially on a consistent basis. Now that we've  seen the performance, the question you as readers would have is how can  you actually use the ETF to earn money.\n\n## How do I follow Congress ETF?\n\nIn our [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf),  we keep a chart that shows the allocation of each symbol in the  portfolio. All trades are long trades, and the chart on average updates  every 1-2 weeks, since not many large trades are frequently made by the  congressmen and women. For instance, an example allocation could be MSFT  (40%) and AAPL (60%) which would mean if you have a 1000 dollars, you  should buy shares worth 400 dollars for Microsoft and worth 600 for  Apple. The chart below shows the allocation of symbols over time. There  are about 47 symbols in the ETF right now, but if that is a large number  for you, you can also pick up the top 10 symbols based on their bar  size in the chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxvoro4dwig81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2efc1622e322d365ca220f5d51c487f92bf189ab\n\nIf you look at the allocation chart, you can see how each new bar  comes after a week or two. That's because very large trades are rarely  made by politicians's, but whenever they are, we pick them right away,  and readjust the ETF. In future, we might automate and allow you to  simply do one click and put a fixed amount of money in the entire ETF.  But right now, the process is somewhat tedious and manual.\n\n## Congressmen &amp; Women ETF\n\nAs we discussed, the Congress ETF at the time of writing this  contains about 47 symbols, which can sometimes be too much to follow for  a retail user. In order to fix that, we also allow users to analyze  individual congressmen and women's portfolios. We employ a similar  process as described earlier on the construct the ETF, but on average,  there are at most 5-10 names in every politician's portfolio, making it  easy for retail traders to follow. But which members of the congress  should we follow? That's a good question and needs answering first.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8qgcn9ewig81.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78f58a30d311f644be9b130c4fc13651cec7ad17\n\nThe chart above shows the average performance of each traded taken by  the best performing congressmen and women. If you've read the news  lately, it is no surprise to see the great Nancy Pelosi in there,  because she did quite well [last year](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/).  These are the people that we want to follow. Now let us take a look at  Nancy's portfolio and see how easy it is at Tradytics to follow her  trades.\n\n## Nancy Pelosi ETF\n\nIn order to get the dashboard for individual members of congress, you can head over to our [Individual Congress Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual).  The default search is already for Nancy Pelosi, so we will dive right  into her portfolio. The figure below shows her ETF performance, symbol  allocation, and the times when readjustments were made to the portfolio.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z9bs9ifwig81.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995e3c0b2f430147f6dbae3212e4f0834dffc6b6\n\nLooking at the screenshot above, the first thing to note is that  although the congress ETF beat SPY by about 2x, the Nancy ETF actually  beat it by 2.6x which shows how good she has been trading lately. The  more important graph is the lower one that shows the allocation of each  symbol in her portfolio at every day the readjustments were made. In  contrast to the congress ETF, there are only about 10-11 symbols in her  portfolio and she only made new trades about a dozen times in the last  year, which is very manageable for retail traders as well. It is easy  for us to keep an eye on her positions in the [dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual) and follow them whenever they are reported.\n\n## Limitations &amp; Final Thoughts\n\nMost people believe that the 45 day delay in reporting causes some  limitations in trying to follow congress trades. As discussed earlier,  that is obviously true to some extent but retail traders can still  follow positions even after that delay, and still be able to earn  similar profits as the members of congress. If you go ahead and take a  look at the trades tables in the dashboards, you will actually see that  many of the positions had not moved much before they were reported to  the public. That is also a criteria that you can use to follow trades -  only go into the ones that haven't moved much at the time of reporting.  Despite some of the limitations, we believe Congress trading is a good  source of generating alpha in the markets and can help retail traders  find an edge. As always, please always do your due diligence before  going into a trade, stay safe, and manage risk. Thank you for reading.",

Weekly (and daily) RSI are the most oversold they've been since the post-IPO dump, and the weekly is curling to put in a bottom \n4. It bounced off the May 2018 and Feb 2020 high today, delicious\n5. The VWAP is $220.78, so easily in reach\n6. Option flows are primarily being driven by Jan 2023 calls being sold, but IV is also in the 83rd percentile, so expect those to be closed out as IV decreases\n7. The current level also shows a successful test of the -2.618 Fib retrace from the September 2021 dump, with the -3 at $201. For reference, it peaked at 3 Fibs on the nose from the March 2020 crash\n8. The weekly 200 &amp; monthly 50 MA sit right at $230, so closing successfully above that willtake it to $266 and eventually $290 to attempt a gap fill\n9. The aforementioned MAs just happen to be right above the 2018/2020 trend, at $228.56\n\nThis is a great spot to dip a toe in, with a stop below $200. If we get a weekly then monthly close over $230, the party is back on.\n\n**TL;DR:** The Metadump can easily become a Metapump if we clear $230 \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15. If this works out, you can send me donations. If it craters, I'll obviously delete my rambling \ud83d\ude1c\n\n**Bonus**: Zucc can buy SPOT &amp; PTON for $45 billion (Black Mirror, anyone?), and still have enough for a super-yacht bigger than Jeff Amazon's + 300 000 metric **fucktons** of cocaine to make these hoes dance. Oh and he'll get $5 billion in cash minus transaction costs from the acquisitions, and be back at $50 billion in cash in a year",

I've broken out two different groups below based around FCF Yield % and this years projected growth.\n\nFCF Yield % is personally one of my favorite metrics in investing and really grabs an idea for a companies internal profitability in respect to their enterprise value.\n\nGroup 1: &gt;2.5% FCF Yield %\n\n1. Meta Platform (FB) - 7.4%\n2. Zoom (ZM) - 5.0%\n3. Alphabet (GOOGL) - 4.1%\n4. Nice (NICE) - 3.3%\n5. Adobe (ADBE) - 3.2%\n6. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - 2.9%\n7. Microsoft (MSFT) - 2.8%\n8. AutoDesk (ADSK) - 2.8%\n9. Salesforce (CRM) - 2.7%\n10. Workday (WDAY) - 2.6%\n\nGroup 2: &gt;25% Projected 2022 Rev Growth + &gt;0.8% FCF Yield %\n\n1. Expensify (EXFY) - 2.1%\n2. ServiceNow (NOW) - 1.6%\n3. Palantir (PLTR) - 1.5%\n4. ZoomInfo (ZI) - 1.2%\n5. JFrog (FROG) - 1.2%\n6. Crowdstrike (CRWD) - 1.1%\n7. Doximity (DOCS) - 1.1%\n8. Zendesk (ZEN) - 1.1%\n9. Atlassian (TEAM) - 1.1%\n10. Semrush (SEMR) - 1.0%\n11. HubSpot (HUBS) - 0.9%\n12. The Trade Desk (TTD) - 0.9%\n\nI personally think this is a great two groups to fish from depending on what you value more as an investor (growth vs relative value). You will have another opportunity to buy back your favorite story stock I promise you.\n\nPersonally I'm eyeing Adobe, Alphabet, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and HubSpot for my next buys (three from each group)\n\nAll the above data is via Koyfin which is an awesome resource I highly recommend!",

Day trading risks burning gains on the inter-week swings.\n\nDo we call a bottom? **No we don't.** We exit put profits throughout the month until the 18th, and begin purchasing calls in anticipation of the $43x bounce-back.\n\nWith the hope it will bounce to an [ATH ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-ATH/) or intermonth ATH between now and March 4th.\n\nAside from accumulating and holding calls for the next 20-30 days, we will re-enter the \"19th\" thesis at our next either [ATH ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-ATH/)($48x+) or Inter-month / quarterly high ($458).\n\nKey Indicators: [MSFT ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MSFT/)[AAPL ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-AAPL/), which providing contradictory trends.\n\nThe gut says we will see the drop to $42x based on this analysis:  [SPY 437.06 \u25bc \u22122.14% SpyvsSpy (tradingview.com)](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/7dIVudIE-19th-cycle-on-the-spy/)",

Relating to stock price, I will only refer to NTDOY for the entirety of this analysis.\n\n# BUSINESS OVERVIEW\n\n**What does NTDOY do?** \\- Nintendo develops, manufactures, and sells video game software and hardware globally. The Company owns some of the world's most successful video game franchises including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Fire Emblem (also Metroid can we get an actual MP4 update ffs) and has substantial ownership of and rights to other intellectual property including Pokemon and Sega.\n\n**How Does NTDOY make money?** \\- Nintendo generates revenue from the sale of physical and digital video games (incl. mobile) and consoles as well as from minority ownership of other popular franchises and licensing fees from toy, fashion brands, and other merchandise sales. The Company has begun diversifying its revenue streams with a new focus on theme parks and increased focus on cinema.\n\n***Recent Developments***\n\n***Mar 2021: Super Nintendo World*** *- Nintendo debuts its first ever theme park \"*[*Super Nintendo World*](https://super-nintendo-world.usj.co.jp/en/us/home)*\" at Universal Studios in Osaka, Japan.* [*The Company plans to expand the park by 2024 and to open additional parks*](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2021/10/07/a-donkey-kong-land-is-likely-coming-to-universal-orlando-but-first-it-will-open-in-japan) *at the Universal Studios locations in* *Los Angeles, California* *(2022, possibly 2023) and Orlando, Florida (2025).*\n\n[Super Nintendo World in Osaka, Japan](https://preview.redd.it/k0odwak1ydj81.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c73acb7db79c0dc51abfffc521fbe3a98a048b15)\n\n* *The Osaka, Japan location currently has two primary attractions:*\n   * *Mario Kart: Koopa\u2019s Challenge* *- Designed for adults and children.

In fact, [data for the highest selling consoles ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles) suggests that Nintendo is to date, the most successful video game console maker in the world:\n\n[Amts in millions.

In an upside case where the Switch 2 is released by March 31, 2023, **it is reasonable to expect 15% sales growth for FY 2023.**\n* Slightly lower operating and net profit margins resulting from increased advertisement spend and R&amp;D, offset by cost efficiency of higher software vs hardware sales mix.\n* Dividend Payout of 40% of Net Income at low end of payout ratio for the past five years.\n\n# MULTIPLES ANALYSIS\n\n|METRIC|FY 2021|Est.

However, for purposes of this stock analysis, it is not possible to conduct a comparable analysis specific to console, PC, or mobile, as well as video game unit sales (okay maybe it's possible but fuck that, I'm not doing all that work for you degens). That stated, I instead compare NTDOY to a select few companies that savvy, totally not retarded investors such as yourselves would be likely to compare NTDOY to including ATVI, EA, SONY, RBLX, and given certain parallels relating to its incredible brand loyalty and IP expansion strategy....DIS.*\n\n*Furthermore, I am leaving out certain video game stocks including TTWO, ZNGA, and several Korean video game centered stocks based on their significantly smaller size in terms of market cap and market share as well as relevant Chinese companies because apparently nobody wants anything to do with Chinese stocks (I don't blame you).* ***This makes the following analysis wide open to counterpoints so if you have wildly differing opinions, feel free to*** ***~~shove them up your ass, find the nearest cliff, and fuck yourself~~*** ***comment below.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bj0o24o3ej81.jpg?width=1004&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=344e4419dcaff7bed15ce2edd896e2cf5f7d0aab\n\nNote the substantial discount that NTDOY trades at related to all multiples aside from P/B (which is quite close). RBLX's multiples are excluded from the means shown above because they're ridiculous and would result in excessive skew for the means. We'll now apply a blended multiples valuation to calculate a PT.\n\n# VALUATION\n\nLet's use EV/Rev, EV/EBITDA, P/B, and P/E as the key metrics for our multiples valuation. We'll average the comps based multiples (excluding RBLX) and 5-year historical averages for NTDOY for a blended approach. This actually results in a lower PT compared to the PT resulting from relying solely on NTDOY's historical averages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|VALUATION METHOD|Blended Price Target|Applied Weighting|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|EV/Rev (3.8x avg)|$86|*25%*|\n|EV/EBITDA (13.7x avg)|$103|*25%*|\n|P/B (3.5x avg)|$87|*25%*|\n|P/E (21.6x avg)|$96|*25%*|\n|**FINAL PRICE TARGET**|**$93**|*100%*|\n\n# Multiples based Price Target: $93\n\nThis PT provides a potential 48% upside when accounting for the expected 2.3% forward dividend yield. Note that this is strictly a 1-year PT since the valuation will surely change substantially over time as Nintendo opens new theme parks and continues to capitalize on its IP expansion strategy. **That said, this is a very long-term hold for me as I firmly believe that Nintendo has yet to tap into its full potential which will likely take many years.**\n\n^(Whereas the development of Metroid Prime 4 will apparently take decades...)\n\n# RISKS\n\n* **Continued Semiconductor Chip Shortage (Moderate)** \\- Could result in lower than expected production of existing Nintendo Switch consoles or *temporary* delay (*note:* ***not*** *cancellations*) of major VG releases, Super Nintendo World openings, or the Nintendo Switch 2.\n* **Execution Risk on IP Expansion Strategy (Low)** \\- Poor sales from the upcoming Super Mario Bros movie could discourage the Company from furthering its push into cinema, resulting in limited lost opportunity relating to Nintendo's long term growth.\n* **Low Trading Volume / Short Selling Risk (Moderately High)** \\- Average daily trading volume is relatively low, ranging from 300k to 400k shares. Stock price performance may be hindered by rebalancing of sizable funds (wtf Cathie Wood) or heavy short selling volume (fkn Melvin). Note that this risk does not preclude the opposite from occurring where low volume or short covering pushes the stock price upward.\n\n# \n\n# TL;DR - $93 PT for 48% 1-Yr Gain (jk, I'm holding forever)\n\n* Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Nintendo Switch Sports and several other popular titles expected this year are actual money printers\n* Super Nintendo World theme parks + Cinema add substantial long-term growth opportunities\n* In recent years, annualized dividend yields have been around 2%. Nintendo has paid variable semi-annual dividends since 1985--hold in taxable account if you want to reclaim a portion of the foreign dividend tax as a tax credit\n* [Remember the DK Rap?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcP91tQ4ZSM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n* [Super Nintendo World](https://super-nintendo-world.usj.co.jp/en/us/home)\n* [Review of Super Nintendo World - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan)\n* [Highest Selling Game Consoles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles)\n* [Highest Grossing Video Game Franchises - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises#cite_note-628)\n* [Top Rated Video Games of All Time - Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered?sort=desc)\n* [Highest Selling Mobile Games - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_mobile_games)\n* [Nintendo Ownership of Pokemon](https://zenmarket.jp/en/blog/post/10040/does-nintendo-own-pokemon)\n* [Nintendo Owned Studios - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_development_teams)\n* [Nintendo Video Game Releases for 2022 Infographic - u/ieatdragonz](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/spa9z5/nintendo_switchs_beginning_lineup_for_2022/)\n* [MSFT Wants to Bring ATVI Games to the Switch - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-call-of-duty-activision-blizzard-games-nintendo-switch)\n* [NTDOY Financials &amp; Guidance FY22 - Nintendo Investor Relations](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2022/220203e.pdf)\n* [The Difference Between Nintendo &amp; Its Competitors](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/06/03/how-nintendo-leveled-up-beyond-gaming-embrace-new-platforms-and-experiences)\n* [Melvin Capital Places $400 Million Bet Against Nintendo - TIME](https://time.com/5352805/nintendo-stock-short/)",

Which is a similar issue for VR and mixed reality. When you strap anything to a person's face, it seems to lose appeal and novelty. \n\n\nSo with that and taking some serious reflection. I am pulling all my share out of Meta and leaving my exposure to Meta via indexes only.  I personally don't have the confidence that this will be more than a passing fad. VR and mixed reality may have enterprise use, but that feels more like MSFT is doing a better job of that.",

    "title": "The Case for $MNDT",
    "selftext": "I come from a cybersecurity background and do a lot of work on cybersecurity companies to understand their businesses and invest in them.\n\nI\u2019m sharing the research I\u2019ve done on one company in particular, $MNDT, because it\u2019s not only a beaten up stock in value territory that is looking better technically, but it is also more relevant today due to the Russia/Ukraine situation. The stock is ripe for a rally.\n\nAs you may know, $MNDT was formerly $FEYE until they sold off the $FEYE product business and brand. This was actually the best possible move, as the product business was legacy and weighed heavily on the fundamentals of the company. Not to mention the very promotional ex-CEO of $FEYE marred the company\u2019s reputation with investors\u2026 an uphill battle the current CEO, Kevin Mandia, has been fighting ever since. As a result, it will take some time for the new $MNDT to re-educate investors about what the company actually does and how it\u2019s different from the old $FEYE. Even though investors will take some time to persuade, the cybersecurity world already has massive respect for Kevin Mandia and his team.\n\n$MNDT is a threat intelligence company made up of some of the most brilliant cybersecurity analysts in the world. They are relied upon heavily by the US government and high risk enterprise organizations that need extra help with forensics, incident response, and intelligence before, during, and after breaches occur.\n\nThe biggest challenge $MNDT faces is resource constraint with their analysts, so it can be difficult to scale their expertise, as there are only so many people you can hire and hours they can work. What they are doing now, is working to use AI/ML to help scale their threat intelligence offerings through Mandiant Advantage.\n\nHere\u2019s where things get really interesting\u2026\n\nBecause $MNDT got rid of the FEYE product business, which included endpoint security, SIEM, network security products, etc. they have actually GREATLY expanded their TAM.\n\nBecause they no longer compete with product companies that sell products in those categories, they can pursue *partnerships* with those product companies instead, and offer to be the threat intelligence layer behind those vendors\u2019 product offerings. That is why you\u2019re seeing partnerships like the one with $S (SentinelOne) starting to form.\n\nMany people who do not understand the new $MNDT and their strategy balked at the idea of $MSFT buying them. I\u2019m here you tell you those people have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. $MSFT has been trying to build a reputation in security for years, and they are getting better at it. After some time, I would expect to see Charlie Bell promoted to CEO of Azure, and Kevin Mandia heading up Cybersecurity at $MSFT, if the acquisition goes through.\n\nThe cherry on top of all of this is that $MNDT is also undervalued from a fundamental perspective, even after yesterday\u2019s rally. It\u2019s trading for 6.5x forward sales. That is dirt cheap for a tech company. When you go look up the numbers and charts, they look skewed because of the sale of the $FEYE product business. They are in transition, so factor that in when you do your own DD, which you should do.\n\nI\u2019m not an investment advisor, I\u2019ve just been working hard to analyze cybersecurity companies for the past several years, and wanted to share my thoughts about this company that gets no love.",

    "title": "Quick Gamma analysis of $SPY",
    "selftext": "  Quick market run down for those awake before the bell\n\n$SPY\n\nGamma Environment: Negative (-1.2bn) \n\nKey Gamma Levels:\n\n14th\n\n450 - R3 resistance\n\n447 - R2 resistance\n\n445 - R1 resistance\n\n442 - S1 (First Support)\n\n438 - S2 (Second Support) \n\n435 - S3 (Third Support) \n\nViews:\n\n\\* Following the 80 point rally from the lows yesterday we noted that that the remaining strength despite a high PPI print as mentioned yesterday would likely be as a result of charm flows going into the market from MOPex. Using historical data on Opex without understanding the context of positioning automatically provides limited info on actual movements that are to be expected. \n\n\\* Based on macro conditions we do not expect natural buyers to exist and with negative seasonality appearing we do not expect bounces to be maintained.\n\n\\* VIX levels based volatility range of +1.3%/-1.3%, Negative gamma environment volatility is likely to continue to be more volatile than the prior week given the switch up in positioning. \n\n\\* SPY remains in less negative territory across the board (both short and long term) (now at $-1.2Bn, down from -$1.8bn yesterday looking two months forward). This has normalised the current levels for this this year, we can expect volatility to maintain and should also expect ranges on either side of the equation but a natural trend higher remains as the final parts of inventory are cleared. See gamma results in the discord to view peak positioning. We continue to maintain that the natural trend still remains lower and based on analogues May seems to be a reasonable point at which we reach a bottom. (There remains a LOT of cash on the side lines that is yet to be deployed). \n\n\\* Call volumes +12.8% and put volumes +4.97% with puts now only \\~2x the volume of calls, following a peak call/put volume disparities. This tells us that the hedge is now coming full circle and as a result given the \n\n\\* 10 Delta Put premiums (455C) vs call IV (at the 10 delta, 435P) is 1.5x in the short term and 1.6 xacross duration an IV basis, the skew here suggests that on the short term basis puts aren\u2019t favourable. They do however remain more favourable beyond this week. Additionally this vol isn\u2019t the highest read we have had thus far, with 2x presenting very strong risk reward. IV skew blows out below 425 and with the tails now currently offering an asymmetric return for those involved in the options market. Flows pushing lower should likely slow. \n\nOrderFlow\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/yfPjlxNP/\n\nFor order flow perspective levels please see the levels provided in the chart. See these lines as \u201cbarriers\u201d to overcome and if done then price can be \u201caccepted\u201d into areas where previous buyers (Navajo white = up volume) and sellers (purple = down volume) wanted to engage up until points where there are much greater levels of volume. These are areas that you can consider as greater points of resistance.\n\nCalls/Puts Volume\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/F4PHUd9Y/\n\n\ud83d\udc02 Scenario \n\nAbove 4444 (with continuous bid at 4460) ($ES) additional call buying to increase up the chain at further expiries and up the chain would be needed to continue this drive up. Note the skew toward call buying has lightened again but below we have a large delta of puts are set to unwind today which can give room to a bounce. We need put buying in further duration to lower and call buyers to move higher. Continuous exhaustion @ 4444 (we are at 4419 as of writing - having found repeat support at 4454) in the first 30 mins defines whether there is a clear aggressive direction and a move above could set us up for a hold above 4580 should positioning continue to drive higher. VIX crush below 18 will also help produce the environment we expect.\n\n\ud83d\udc3b Scenario\n\nIf we maintain below 4400 in particular we\u2019re interested in further sell off as this level provides a key level down. That being said this remains a strong floor and looks unlikely to break where we assign a 17% probability of this breaking. A break below this could generate sell down to 4300 as Vanna flows above drive us lower and with put gamma at 4350 and below increasing exponentially. This begins to act as a magnet to price with selling intensifying from above and below. We would need to see call buying decline in AAPL/TSLA as well as semi weakness, very important as TSM has just reported upward guidance. VIX maintaining over 22, new highs with VIX combined with ES new lows 22 which adds credibility to increased sell. We would also need to see some weakness in big tech, in particular we note AAPL, TSLA, MSFT as these remain the key drivers of the prior rally particularly and strength in gold miners and other precious metal cos (NEM, GLD,SLV etc)",

    "selftext": "BBBY is going higher and is going to turn everything around. This last earnings report was horrendous BUT there are some interesting clues in the earnings call we will get to later. \n\nLets start with Ryan's letter to Bed Bath: \n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\nSome highlights here. The letter starts out setting the table that management has been garbage with giving returns to shareholders and throws a TON of shade on the CEO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai3z1jnsret81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d23fbe9f6f5bf65c759131362056f5dc8d3d494\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzxqayz2set81.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cdf5d0bba31a4e45b1fccbbd88b7eaf1cc62719\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98h42lq9set81.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11bb2cdaa340fc7cf616d16044bddc99cec360b3\n\nTLDR the CEO is only destroying the company. Returns are down in the market and sales are down while other retailers are doing the numbers they were doing before the pandemic, thus making the pandemic not an excuse for not executing. He goes on to point out the lack of insider ownership: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6lihbftset81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58aad3fa98775c6101c41ee1bd010720c3946f5f\n\nNow for the juicy stuff: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1krk194tet81.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d57db1e13adb77c6a763b14cf73c5c65c372f1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9p6dreptet81.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed4464118c709092810edc675a9f694f106cd42\n\nThe long of the short here is the market is valuing BBBY so low because the company IS going that direction right now. No insiders are buying, the company has little cash and cannot deploy cash to buy backs and invest in its infrastructure and continue to grow its brands all at the same time. THEY NEED CASH. So how do they get the cash? They sell BABY\n\nHow much cash can they raise with BABY though? Here is Ryan's thoughts: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my4juvjguet81.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949c948e64156e84906d0e71df23b046a4a6f08c\n\nHere is what Ryan is saying BABY is worth. Shout out to shark tank for always spamming 5x multiples at everyone when they say their biz is worth 5 million bucks on 20k sales. Going off this logic, if BABY doing sales by 2023 of 1.5 billion then applying the multiple means it could sell for 7.5 Billion.  \n\nYou might think this is crazy, why would anyone pay 5x for a business's sales? Well they do it now. MSFT bought ATVI for 68.7 Billion when the 2021 revenues were only 8.8 Billion. That would be a multiple of 7.8. Berkshire Hathaway just bought Alleghany Corp for 11.6 Billion with sales of  about 1 Billion and that would be a 11x multiple. There are other examples but just know 5x is cheap for a big well known name with an established infrastructure and customer base like Bed Bath and Beyond. \n\nTo tie this all together, here is the current value of the company. The great news is that you don't need to bother looking up the share count on unreliable websites and estimates from yahoo finance that differ from market watch that are different from etrade. Here it is from the company itself on their earnings call today:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5gsso9gxet81.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77e23c714fe7e76eff63027a8485940c90685a4\n\nSo we KNOW there are only 80 million shares out there. 80 million \\* 17.76 (todays close) = 1.420.8 Billion. Funny how the total equals 1.420 just saying when 04/20 is a week away haha. \n\nBUT if we valued BBBY just on BABY alone, the company would be worth 7.5 billion/80 million shares = 93.75. I have seen a TON of speculation as to why Ryan bought calls that exercise as high as $80/share. Well this gets interesting but its quite clear that if Ryan is right about value and they find a buyer, the share price here is going to over 90 which puts all these calls in the money: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az9azeclyet81.png?width=1507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9564a036cd937bee734e5d6ff34685583e5f826\n\nI did the math so your smooth brain does not have to. The total amount of options he purchased were 16,701 option contracts with a cost average of 1,785,257. NOTE these expire in Jan of 2023. Ryan does not give a dam about the actual value of these contracts at all. These contracts exist for exercise purposes only and are not going to be sold. \n\nRyan has 9.4 million shares right now in BBBY and this represents 9.8% of the outstanding shares according to the letter written back on March 6th. Links under the pictures: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s.wsj.net\\/public\\/resources\\/documents\\/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/2pbqvoukzet81.png?width=1216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1560c779e328354dc4b356ff3624c2b462e2b)\n\nOn pure coincidence this is a very similar level to the GME letter that was sent back in Nov of 2020: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/Archives\\/edgar\\/data\\/1326380\\/000101359420000821\\/rc13da3-111620.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ad4xi7drzet81.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb71fefb6d69d081d8c6d0228e31a23389a685e3)\n\nAs we all know Ryan actually increased his share count recently and back in Dec 15th of 2020 after he already made the 9% stake in GME. \n\nNow for proof BBBY is listening to Cohen. This part of the letter calls for BBBY to stop commenting on certain things: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8hd2loj1ft81.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdaf7bb18332a662e8f10a9b9df4fee44d28a318\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5r6thnr1ft81.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55c2876aff197782f6752258d10e938d960df6da\n\nIts obvious that Cohen does not want BBBY to give anything away ever again. Here is the proof from the transcript of this earnings call today: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdysz0v22ft81.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b592965a3350d1192864cdc2f19dc0c63bfffb6a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah93hky62ft81.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f976fc2ce708d58167a29090b9ece7567435c024\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yimz24bb2ft81.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc38ce5c70285fef6839fdc7456b5003c7c41e3\n\nSo its quite obvious that the board and the CEO are 1000% on board with Cohen here on the plans for the future. This being the case, then there is an extremely strong possibility that BABY gets sold and for a very hefty premium at that around 7.5 billion or higher.  \n\nIf Ryan is Ryan here, he will be buying even more BBBY in the future. Considering the spacing of a purchase in August of GME and then a purchase in Dec even after GME moved up over 100% from what he bought it at, this could mean Ryan will buy BBBY even if it moves to the upside here probably in the next 3-4 months. But I would not even be shocked if he made the purchase even sooner than this. \n\nWhat moves stocks? NEWS. If you have been in this game for more than 1 day, you know NEWS is everything. NEWS will move your stock up 20% or down 20%. The market dgaf about anything except for NEWS. Theres an entire NEWS channel dedicated to the stock market, tickers are over tv programs that have nothing to do with stocks. Pure news will drive everything. \n\nWhen the market gets wind there might be a negotiation for BABY or a component of BBBY, this will move the stock, and its going to move hard. The market will have to acknowledge BBBY has an asset generating sales at 1.5 billion with a forward multiple of at least 5x. This company being worth 1.4 Billion is an absolute Joke. Their total liquidity from the earnings call IS their market cap!! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.fool.com\\/earnings\\/call-transcripts\\/2022\\/04\\/13\\/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcr\\/](https://preview.redd.it/z6sm4o2x3ft81.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f34d2eb2cb3fd64a5b21a3977e70adcdd3445aa0)\n\nThere are endless good news cycles ahead. Insider buying, share re purchase program, Ryan buying even more, BABY being sold. Even when the stock gets over 90, Ryan can literally just exercise his options and gain another 1.7 million shares giving him even more ownership. \n\nFor what it is worth, here is the major ownership levels if you care to dig further into who owns what:  \n\n\n[https:\\/\\/whalewisdom.com\\/stock\\/bbby](https://preview.redd.it/awy620gq4ft81.png?width=1899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da7aae952087cd321dc584b251b9a9b5882baa91)\n\nFeel free to correct me about anything you find wrong here.

    "selftext": "The recent offer that Musk make for acquiring Twitter (TWTR) made me dig into what I would consider a reasonable price for the buyout. My initial thought was that Musk is very aggressive in his \"take it, or leave it, I'm not negotiating, offer for $54.20 per share\" and the offer honestly seems low. Why do I think so?\n\nMusk is making an offer based on a daily price as two specific points of time - the day he purchased his 9.2% share and the day he disclosed it - but usually such offers are based on average stock price over a more extended period of time. Take Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATV), for example. Microsoft is paying a large premium over current price at the point of announcing the deal (close to 50%), but they are also paying a premium over the price on a MA200 basis. MA200 on January 14th has been at $81.23 despite recent downslide, which means Microsoft paid 17% premium on an MA200 basis, and also offered a price ($95 a share), which is below, but still close to 52-week high ($99.46).\n\n**Summary** (MSFT acquisition of ATV)\n\n* **17%** premium over MA200 price (**$81.23**)\n* Price (**$95**) below but close to 52-week high (**$99.46**)\n\nNow where is TWTR compared to that. As of April 14th, the MA200 is at $52.14 and the 52-week high is at $73.34. Elon's offer is mere 3.95% premium on the 200-day moving average and is way below the annual high. If we take the same % premium Microsoft was willing to pay, the price tag must be at at least $61. If he's really willing to pay 30% premium, then the price should be $67.78. This is still below the 52-week high, but would be a reasonable and acceptable offer for the shareholders.\n\n**Summary** (Musk offer for TWRT)\n\n* **3.95%** premium over MA200 price (**$52.14**)\n* Offer (**$54.20**) way below 52-week high (**$73.34**)\n* Acceptable offer at **30%** premium over MA200 is **$67.78.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

    "selftext": "  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something\u2026 In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That\u2019s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cbff1k4flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c88e247274869141c67e29ea0f55e342e3a046bf\n\nTuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a \u201cnormal\u201d spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to \u201crest\u201d before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. \n\nHistorically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move\u2026 Spy dipping to 440.6 \u00e0 it involves a rest period\u2026 SPY breaking back above the 8ema\u2026 Spy breaking to 442.3 \u00e0 then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move\u2026 so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\\_\\_\\_-. \n\nMy point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6kk5555flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a29142cfd1fc794a4766fe400267a253eafb9f76\n\nThis mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx249ku5flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536a61250fbef3166d9bc55010541985bffb8c82\n\nI also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7h7c2ne6flt81.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a846b916b4e8e867a1203b63d3b04a0eff9595\n\nI had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. \n\nBull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. \n\nBear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. \n\nWe have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   \n Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&amp;J\n\nWednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)\n\nThursday- more airlines, at&amp;t, SNAP\n\nFriday- nothing too notable\n\nSo the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fmnby77flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2231bd8a40a188a3ff7940aee0560dc908475c63\n\nApple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. \n\nBull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. \n\nBulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. \n\nBear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. \n\nToday I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvg7y9w7flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80c743f2529336a5252a6e5ec363ef449d3f2805\n\nAMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. \n\nThis will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. \n\nLooking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 \u00e0 $85 \u00e0 80 \u00e0 and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. \n\nFor the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet\u2026 some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h8w8sk8flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cad9975294ee40cd03342febaf5cb1275945383f\n\nSomeone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it\u2026 Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. \n\nI make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high\u2026 that\u2019s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aoul8wb9flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c127767a9d0855bea07795907eef9c5100b08de\n\nFord actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. \n\nI will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. \n\nFord is 40% of its 52 week high\u2026 Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. \n\nI will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/roawb1w9flt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30d527874a2a3aac8f2450fb9959decfe350880\n\nAh yes last but not least\u2026 the QQQ\u2019s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793\n\nIts one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the \u201cshoulder\u201d yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this\u2026 I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). \n\nBull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. \n\nBulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. \n\nBear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  \n\nBears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/latynl7bflt81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=891d7a74268c3d05db9b6a2e7b5c0202301636e8\n\nThe VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my \u201clevels\u201d on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tq8tztcflt81.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=906d7d725ab77b74b5f9b6ffba5ef37639fe14ab\n\nI am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for \u201cyou are a great trader but you aren\u2019t a weather forecaster.\u201d Me being me who is dead inside and doesn\u2019t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. \n\nThe one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a \u201csmall\u201d position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. \n\nI had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. \n\nI close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. \n\nWhy did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn\u2019t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn\u2019t sit well with me. \n\nI am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and \u201ccommitment\u201d on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. \n\nI have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.\n\nWeekly trade log-\n\nI made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). \n\nMy total weekly win rate was 72%. \n\nPut win rate was 79% \n\nCall win rate was only 40%. \n\nMy biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. \n\nMy weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. \n\nRealized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. \n\n20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%\n\n10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. \n\nThis is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. \n\nLooking back at the last month of data for more information\u2026\n\n76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate\n\n30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. \n\nThat\u2019s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. \n\nI look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. \n\nNOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. \n\nThis also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. \n\nThursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.\n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",

    "title": "4-21-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily (weekly) TA",
    "selftext": "Note- I will be out of town this weekend and will be traveling all day tomorrow. I will be trading mobile but will not be active on the server and I will also NOT have my standard/ normal weekly TA up. If I have time Sunday night I will get something up otherwise look for my pre-market post Monday and then Monday night I will get a bigger TA posted. I am adding some further TA details here especially for spy for people to keep in mind going into next week. \n\nIf someone would have told me that I would be able to play a 449 and 437 option in the same day and that they both would be ATM I would have called you a big fat liar. However, today was something else for sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vc4ck42x9zu81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37c76d5b587a0783200bccb89063248b49c5e1cb\n\nI have to zoom very far out just to be able to catch the whole range of motion. SPY saw a total of $12.91 movement today which is almost triple its expected move of $5.74 and is nearly double its ATR of $6.5 (it has not been updated to $7.25 after todays candle). That\u2019s a hella of a lot of movement today. From its peak of 450.01 to its lowest point today SPY dropped 2.95% total and along the way broke through every \u201csupport\u201d that was established this week. As you can see at the top of this picture there is the massive black dotted line that WAS the upper resistance line for the bear channel. We did break it but with this recent price action pushing us lower I am going to adjust the channel limit to reflect that as our new high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiq9bncy9zu81.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df1a2169f35c36fc2a351077ef531460644c8e26\n\nWhich gives us something like this! So putting this together now we have a major support tomorrow at 430-431 and major resistance of 448-449. Those will be two key levels for bears and bulls to touch or break through. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/namcc7uy9zu81.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f8213aa9ef5978f75535b3c6d307455f98757a\n\nAn interesting comparison to Tuesdays price action shows that we finished right in the middle of that sideways channel we hard. With the support being 435 and resistance being 439.5. Now that we are back here and essentially nullified everything that happened yesterday and today with the finish we will look at 435 and 439.5 as key levels to break through before the next move up. With the theme of the week we very week may just see a completely sideways day tomorrow though I do not suspect that personally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8a2y7kz9zu81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd33ffa4b9a7bc12268ff93bb2aa6d12e2b7a46b\n\nThe Daily candle today with that 2.95% is pretty wild looking. I haven\u2019t seena candle that size since January. I had to slightly tweak the bear channel but for the most part SPY actually respected the red bear channel today with 449 being the resistance I had but with error for a daily chart 450 is reasonable to expect too. The red bear channel gives a low of 431 tomorrow and a high of 449. Of course I do not think we will see 449 but its obviously not impossible. \n\nBut the one major thing to take away from todays finish was that we now closed a candle BELOW the daily 8, 20, 50, 100 AND 200 ema. That is a bearish omen. However, on a positive note we did NOT make a new weekly low. We actually finished at this 437.5 to 438 support range which we saw as a solid bottom last Wednesday/ Thursday and Tuesday this week. We will need to watch closely tomorrow to see if SPY can hold the 437 level overnight and at open tomorrow. If we were to break below the 437 level I would suspect based off my levels that we could see 433 and if that breaks 428. \n\nBulls really need to see a close ABOVE 444 tomorrow to get some bullish momentum back for next week with Google and Apple earnings. At a minimum 440 should be the target for bulls tomorrow knowing that that daily 200ema is a major support/ resistance line. \n\nI still honestly do not quite know what spooked the markets today or what caused this 2.95% turn down that we saw. We were testing 450 resistance and then it plummeted. Biden did speak about the Ukraine/ Russia war today but honestly watching it live it was a whole lot of nothing. There was a JPOW speech at 11 that I didn\u2019t get to listen too but I didn\u2019t hear anything exciting and then I watched the IMF global economic \u201cround table\u201d today and truthfully there was a whole lot of nothing that the markets didn\u2019t already know. The markets already expect a 50bps rate hike for may, we already know inflation sucks and we know that global inflation sucks. So to be 100% honest I have no idea what caused such an over reaction today. I also am surprised to see this move today after Tesla killed earnings. That really should have set a pretty bullish thesis for next week with Apple and Google. But perhaps the markets are a little spooked with everything going on right now and will wait for the heavy hitter Apple to drop earnings first. \n\nThe only thing I can really relate it to once again is the VIX. Today it told the story one again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4frt2nd0azu81.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3798f52e1bc7687fe027856f6f3a1d695202696\n\nWith an incredibly flat open that hugged that 19.8 to 20 range until about 10am the only explanation I have is that the VIX wanted to revert back to its recent high mean which if you remember our most recent range has been 18.7 to 24.8. So with us riding that 20 range all morning its not too surprising we saw a run up like that today. With the VIX now settled back in the middle of this range there is definitely room for it to move either way tomorrow once again. The one thing I will say that was different today about the VIX was that it did NOT spike it very steadily all day long climbed up. Usually we see some massive vix candles but they really were all very mild today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjhd4sy0azu81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b345b9e6956619f11e9c2369bfd32a1c37dffcf9\n\nApple had initially a killer day and I thought even with SPY dropping as hard as it was that Apple was going to stay green and keep its green day. It took almost all day for Apple to give in. I was actually incredibly impressed and for quite a long time suspected that Apple was going to be a base for SPY to recover but once Apple started dumping I feel like SPY just tanked harder with the snowball effect. \n\nApple as you can see is well out of its bear channel. I well make that adjust today though and see what happens tomorrow. But I drew a small bull channel that Apple could be in now. The grey bull channel gives a range of 167 to 172.5 tomorrow for Apple. Apple closed below its daily 8, 20, and 50 ema today, however, managed to stay above its daily 100ema at 165.74. If Apple can hold that daily 100ema I believe it can take a bullish momentum into earnings next week on Thursday after the bell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z84quh1azu81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43b7351e37041f36ec065dc3b57cddc8636eba71\n\nYesterday I mentioned QQQ had officially broken its bear channel, but it appears that we actually are still within one now. I was looking for some upward momentum on QQQ today to finish the week with hopes it could see 355-360 next week but it looks like that is not in play just yet. The main takeway for QQQ today was that it closed its candle back below the daily 8ema. It also finished right at a major support of 344.15. It finished on the money at 344.15 which is the lowest price action from the January dip. On January 24th QQQ closed a candle at 353.3 but its lowest point of the day was 344.15. If QQQ is unable to retain green momentum tomorrow we will see the next support level from end of February which is 328. After that it\u2019s the most recent low of 317. \n\nGoing into this week I actually for the first time in quite a long time had some bullish bias and hope for the markets. I was seeing some very healthy movement from SPY, Apple and the QQQs that made me believe we COULD see a retest of recent highs. After today honestly im not quite sure what to think. After two red days I would suspect that we are going to see a green day tomorrow, if nothing at minimum a relief rally. However, when I look at the most recent largest red candles down they are almost all followed by another smaller red candle down, some of which have long upper wicks that test retrace about 50% of the previous days price action. However, most of those are in a downward trend already which would make sense for a follow up red. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n79jaz02azu81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19fe35465d8003c1f2809eaa97f2b8c5f8007afe\n\nOne last crayon drawing\u2026 yeah Tradingviews drawing capabilities aint great\u2026 that I wanna point out is this one. If we look back at the end of January/ beginning of February \u201cbottom\u201d and then the march \u201cbottom\u201d what do you see? You see a period of sideways consolidation of 5-7 candles before a breakout. Arguably today should have been a breakout day, but with today we are at 11 candles under the high of 450 and above the low of 435. So within a $15 range we have a total of 11 candles. That\u2019s over two weeks of essentially flat movement. \n\nThe current pattern is Low (end of January) \u00e0 new high (middle of February) \u00e0 low (middle of march) \u00e0 high (beginning of April) \u00e0 low (right now middle of April) \u00e0 high? Trend break? To be determined\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tr0fdgj2azu81.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=864b94aade213e470277338bb463449abcffd350\n\nStrictly from a trend aspect we should see another high, it doesn\u2019t have to be another higher high but we should at minimum see 455-460 before we would see anymore downside. However, looking at the overall major bear channel we are in you can see that there is also a trend where we very well COULD make a new lower low which following the current channel puts us somewhere near 390 to 400 by middle to end May. \n\nMy one issue with this is that what is going to cause such a panic that we actually fall another 10+%? If I have learned anything over these last three months its that the markets can price things in faster that CNBC can shill it. Today I truly cant explain why the market reacted the way it did. There truly is not a new worthy piece to even share. FOMC meeting is still two weeks away, JPOW doesn\u2019t have anything scheduled and when questioned lately he didn\u2019t drop and scary news, CPI is over and not for another 3 weeks, Russia is attacking still but markets really stopped caring about that a few weeks ago. Even with Biden bringing up the war today that wasn\u2019t anything we don\u2019t know\u2026 aka we are sending a fuck ton of aid. \n\nReally the only \u201cnew\u201d thing is some fed members talking about a 75bps hike BUT Jpow confirmed today that they will do a 50bps hike in May. So when I think about what could and will cause SPY to break another 10% lower from here I really cant think of one. I mean truthfully there is not really anything that shake the markets wild. The only thing that would make me believe we could and will see a new low below 410 is IF Russia were to attack the US, or if JPOW drops a 100bps hike on us without a warning. But even both of those should be short lived. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qamqjq53azu81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8a62ea4fe2853a1e294efb104ce2f94a030cd88\n\nThe more I see it and the more it think about it this is what I am seeing. This blue sideways channel is what I am seeing and what we very well may be stuck in for the rest of 2022 or at least till the end of 2022. With the double tops at 458 and double bottoms at 415 those levels will be something to keep an eye on. If we continue this bear momentum and break 430 I will look for 420 and then 415. If we break further then 410 then I would suspect us to see the 300s but for me until SPY breaks this tan channel downward (455) or touches the bottom of the blue channel (415) or breaks the blue channel and heads towards 400. We are pretty much in no mans land. \n\nThe bulls have/ had the momentum and with a good earnings next week from Google and Apple I believe 455 is possible. \n\nNext week notable earnings-\n\nMonday- Coca Cola \n\nTuesday- 3M, Google, MSFT, GM\n\nWednesday- Boeing, Ford, META\n\nThursday- Amazon, Apple, Intel\n\nFriday- Exon\n\nAs you can see Tuesday and Thursday we got 4 big hitters with Google, MSFT and then Thursday we have Amazon, apple and Intel. We also have META on Wednesday which has taken a 14% hit over the last two days. I think Google and MSFT will kill it but META absolutely could see another massive flop. Amazon barely scrapped by last time, however, we once again have Apple to ride us off into the sunset. \n\nIf we were to get a miss by any of these next week.. especially more than one.. and we could be looking at the 400 SPY catalyst. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nToday was a great day trading washed away by one trade that I didn\u2019t need to enter and also breaking my own rules of not fighting the trend. Today was my first net red day since Monday April 11th. Below is my daily trading log. If it does say it was SPY. It has the DTE followed by what % I closed at. As you can see I made 13 trades today (12 if we don\u2019t count the Tesla yolo). So 12 trades with 3 being red. So 75% on the day. My biggest loses came from buying calls and not being able to close them out. I played myself today. \n\n4/21/2022 Put 4dte -9%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 23%\n\n4/21/2022 Call 1 dte -42%\n\n4/21/2022 Put (apple)  1dte 23%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 19%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 20%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 20%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 21%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte -2%\n\n4/21/2022 Put (tesla earnings lotto) 1dte -99%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 5%\n\n4/21/2022 Put 1dte 10%\n\n4/21/2022 Call 1dte -38%\n\nWith todays massive dip my SPY Hyperwheel took a huge hit. \n\nMy puts expire tomorrow and are incredibly red. With a \u201cprojected\u201d close right now I am -1.91% hyperwheel and -0.05% with buy and hold.\n\nThe plan tomorrow If we are red I will let myself get assigned and play CC next week expecting more downside. IF we are green tomorrow I will roll my puts one week out and re-evaluate post earnings. \n\nI will give you my weekly numbers (I do plan to trade tomorrow but it will be VERY light since im gonna be mobile). \n\nI made 38 trades this week. 28 of them were green. (1 was a lotto so wont count that in stats).\n\nAverage% per trade- 7% (up from 5% last week)\n\nGoal weekly profit $2000 (only trading 4 days)\n\nActual weekly profit- $4,226\n\nWin rate- 74% (up from 72% last week)\n\nI played 26 puts and 11 calls. \n\nCall win rate- 63.6% (up from 40% last week)\n\nPut win rate- 80.7% (up from 79% last week)\n\n0-2dte win rate (26 trades)- 88.5% (up from 65% last week)\n\n3+ dte win rate (12 trades)- 50% (way down from 70% last week)\n\nThat\u2019s very interesting as my plan this week (which I stuck to heavily early in the week) that I wanted to focus on longer DTE trades as I felt I was doing better with them. However, what I think I learned this week was being happy going into a trade, take profits at 10-20% (usually by a trailing stop loss), re-evaluating and re-entering the trade if I still feel confident in it. I do like seeing an improvement in my win rate this week and my weekly profit. I gave up a lot of profit end of day today being greedy but overall realistically this was a killer week for me.",

    "selftext": "Lets talk about Big Tech for a moment.\n\nSpecifically Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\n\nMeta is down the most of them all. It definitely has the most potential to rebound (for anyone looking to play OTM LEAPS) but is also the riskiest because there's basically no floor. If their AR/VR pivot continues to flop and the market remains bearish it FB can easily keep drilling down.\n\nNext MSFT. Great company for the long term, although shares are a little pricey right now and their P/E ratio is too high for my liking. I'll pass for the time being.\n\nAmazon - I have no idea how to trade this one tbh. Obviously AWS is a money printer and it will carry the company even if the retail division fails. However it's very possible that AMZN could fill the COVID gap and you could be bagholding for a while.\n\nFinally, Google. GOOG is probably the strongest company in the world right now. It has its fingers in just about everything- ads, cloud, hardware, AI. Calls are risky because of theta crush if the market stays flat for a while, but buying shares right now should be very safe and it probably the most attractive risk/reward trade right now. In almost no scenario short of a major major market crash do we see GOOG dip below 2000 again.",

Now our only hopes are to prepare the life boats (apple, and amazon). If those 100 year old life boats don\u2019t keep us afloat we will see the bottom of the ocean (SPY sub 400) very soon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nj1vl1lh8yv81.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d83c8f9a2fabaa6de3ee8a3755979a2e5ceab250\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/movo7y0i8yv81.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff53bfa31bae242893133a7d9465c54a77618bc8\n\nAs you can see we are in a MASSIVE bear channel and we are testing lows we haven\u2019t seen since beginning on March. I actually am a little surprised by today. Though my pre-market analysis did mention that Monday had the potential to have been a bear market dead cat bounce and that we would continue to drill. Well drill they did and drill I don\u2019t think they will stop\u2026\n\nI am actually impressed they were able to get this to -2.90% today that\u2019s hell impressive. We are actually at the bottom of our bear channel on the daily now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2fmzkki8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97aff8d962f90d8e85659333b545a5b279f3231c\n\nHowever, with MSFT beating earnings but market not responding very well and Google getting wrecked right now missing their earnings there is VERY little hope that SPY will have the green pre-market it needs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqzgbu5j8yv81.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b2e674e7782e249dbe4ff099641e30271fd3a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gersvb0k8yv81.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0b530d66436229c42cf83367549c40ce5d83417\n\nAs you can see the only two bull saviors are the bears best friends. QQQ is currently down -1.4% and Spy down -0.56%. I would be shocked to wake up with green especially since it doesn\u2019t seem like the MSFT or Goog guidance calls really did anything good. \n\nDaily wise we are going to need to see resistance broken at 416 \u00e0 420 (the major resistance point) and eventually see bulls push for an EOW test of the daily 8ema at 431.83. \n\nDaily wise the bears tomorrow will look to break through two key supports. First one is at 415.5 (we are already below that now after hours) and then 410. If we break 410 that is the lowest low from the current bear market we are in.   \n   \n \n\nWe very well MAY see a new lower low. Based off the most recent lows of 420 \u00e0 410 \u00e0 400 is the most natural point we may hit. That also puts us at the lower support line of the huge orange channel we are in. \n\nThe current market environment is not good. I know there are quite a few who look at January and see the massive rally we had or even the massive rally we had in March when we bottomed at 415. But history does not repeat the pass. I mean this week MIGHT be the best time ever to load on some LEAPS but we also very well may see 350-380 end of year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0s7wxwk8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c66f604b05607fc0ffbe0d43fd4d8b81b9d6abc0\n\nIf you look at the weekly chart and draw a line through the \u201caverage\u201d price point from 2018 to 2020 it lines up perfectly with the Weekly 200ema which is sitting right at 360.57 right now. I don\u2019t know if the markets got the balls to do it but damnit we just might fing do it. We just might break down over this next month and see 360. That would essentially negate everything that happened in 2020/2021 and rest the market back on the 2018/2019 bull path. Which is arguable a more normalize bull path and normal market behavior path. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e94n3pel8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e56a8409189bfd5e4b1500f31d93b3b680d1d18\n\nHere is zoomed out a little more. I thought January was going to take us to this point but they rallied us. We will see if the markets let this happen of if they rally us again. This may be a SLOW drawn out process where we just bounce up and down the whole way there. \n\nTo be honest until Friday comes and we see Markets react tomorrow intraday and Thursday after hours once Apple and Amazon release we are a little bit in limbo here. Friday will be very interesting time to assess the Weekly and daily update chart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vze1omyl8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5ec74baae1438cb0818ba396ee6916b2a9f58a\n\nApple got absolutely destroyed today and its getting wrecked even more after hours right now down 1.21%. I have pretty low hopes in a rally tomorrow BUT we may hit that rubber band point at some point tomorrow. But this is the first candle closed BELOW the 200ema on apple since March. In January it broke below the 200ema for a candle and in march the next candle it rebounded back above. I am not sure if it will this time or not. On a low side Apple could very well see 145 if this channel is correct. We will see how markets react tomorrow to know for sure. And even more importantly end of week we will see where Apple is at. If we close a full candle below the 200ema I think 140 is in play and especially if earnings are bad Thursday night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhlkn1hm8yv81.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093bba2eb0195bc0537164901f545b2a63993f73\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2xw41ym8yv81.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99cbf86619cab6221060c0709121e480a83f8b4d\n\nQQQ actually had an incredibly bearish finish today. It broke and closed below its lowest point from the January and March dips. And is currently sitting well below that at 313. Currently based off the channel its in 313 is the low but overall sub 300 is possible for QQQ. 270 is its weekly 200ema and much like SPY its very possible we could attempt to see that this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zopcxcfn8yv81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3748c788573950b22ab64c9928244a9527a49a1\n\nBelieve it or not the VIX is actually still lower than it was in January and February when QQQ/ SPY was at these levels. The VIX was at 37 around those times and we only closed at 33.51 today. 31.5 was a massive hurdle it felt like of the VIX to get over though. At some point this is going to recoil and unwind and whenever that does is when we will get the massive bull run I am just not sure when that will happen. \n\nThe thing is we need something to drop that VIX level and its very possible we will NOT see that until after the FOMC meeting next week. Arguably looking at the VIX candles now vs the last three months the run up in the VIX is way more extreme then it was any of the other times. Even January was a nice steady climb. The VIX just did a massive move up the last 4 trading days. Yes yesterday did fall some but all of that and some were made up for today. 35 to 36.5 are the next VIX levels which I would be shocked not to see after all these after hours BS. \n\nThe one thing that I will caveat all of everything I just said in this post and about how bearish I am is that the VIX is our guide. With the VIX at the current level it is at, yes it CAN go higher to say 40, BUT it is VERY unlikely we will see that kind of level without some sort of nuclear war fall out, 2nd pandemic, feds gonna do a hike of 150bps sort of thing the VIX is going to unwind very soon here. And when it does SPY is going to sky rocket. We may have to wait till next week after FOMC but its gonna happen. Its just a matter of time. The question is how long will people wait? \n\nThe other thing to think about it how we are not approaching \u201cfire sale\u201d territory where algos, joe blow, and everyone else is going to see the markets and say well damn this is the buying opportunity of my life time\u2026 I missed the one in January I wont miss this one sort of mentality is gonna start popping up soon. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n4/26/2022 Put 1dte 21%\n\n4/26/2022 Put 1dte 5%\n\n4/26/2022 Call 1dte 3%\n\n4/26/2022 Put 1dte 15%\n\n4/26/2022 Put 1dte 15%\n\n4/26/2022 Call 1dte -8%\n\n4/26/2022 Put 1dte 25%\n\n4/26/2022 Put 1dte -8% \n\nOverall today was a great day. I had two small -8% losses that I am not worried about otherwise had some nice wins with some bigger 15-25% profits. I had quite the losses to make up for after Monday getting burned on a put so I was happy to see that I made it back over that and I am officially net green for the week day trade wise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ma2ta32o8yv81.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04ea7a0a09c28bb742b938176997056d61c6bec3\n\nCurrently running with these Lottos right now\u2026 seeing that MSFT has made a MASSIVE recovery even since I posted this now being up 5% so who knows whats going to happen tomorrow now. Apple and Spy are recovering too. It will be very interesting morning tomorrow for sure and an even more interesting day.

But Microsoft has done it again, thumbed its nose at the naysayers, and churned out more profits. I expect microsoft to be a stalwart safehaven in any market downturn. Its windows and office suite products utterly dominate the market. Since microsoft has switched to a \"renewal\" type licensing, its widespread adoption by corporate america, government entities and schools everywhere ensures that it has a consistent flow of licensing revenues in any sort of economy. Every government agency, state, municipal or educational uses microsoft and as a result churns out tax dollars every year (or even monthly depending on the license) to microsoft, king of software.

    "selftext": "  \n\nGoing to keep this brief because Ive unfortunately got a sick kiddo at home who so kindly passed it along to me. Gonna try to rest up before tomorrow so I can be on my game. But we had some fairly \u201cbig\u201d things happen today honestly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6197q9fs5w81.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dff01842200b28d7610eb06435a207f2d531e0ba\n\nIn the moment its impossible to tell but we essentially just had a massive $6.52 range day today. While also maintaining a slight bull channel that broke as you can see (ill show zoomed out below) the current bear channel we have been in since last Wednesday. That\u2019s a big win for the bulls! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0d6w6wqfs5w81.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57cf93469c87cc081c8fa23573e19fe5edc73e21\n\nFor those that follow me you know I am not one to scream manipulation, or anything like that. The markets are erratic and in the end we are playing a risky game that most people fail at. I believe only 0.02% of all people in the world are professional/ successful day traders (if my statistics are correct). \n\nAnyways, this week has once again been humbling. We need to remember quick profits are king. When we hold through these massive violent days and swings we are just getting ate alive. We also have to accept a bad entry. I struggle with that today especially willing to admit my entry was bad and help a call to -80% that I was lucky enough to recover for 11% before the 2nd dip of the day. But I then got stuck in a call that I now have to carry and definitely don\u2019t like the idea of carry it over night. But in the end the choices we make have consequences. When green wins the MM win. We have to remember we have to play their game. If they want violent wild swings that\u2019s fine! We just take profits early!\n\nSo lets talk about the fuckery of the day today. \n\nOvernight we had MSFT killing it and of course Google sucking air through a straw. Spy opened up very green this morning and just took off immediately reaching 422.02 by 945a. It was pretty arguable that with the VIX opening at 31.11 after closing at 33.77 the day before and dropping all the way to 29.89 at open that we were going to see one hell of a bull run. At these VIX levels a 2-3% green day is just as easy if not easier to accomplish then a red -2.9% we saw yesterday. \n\nWell then 10am came and we saw Spy go from its HOD all the way to 415.01 within 30 minutes time. That\u2019s a total of 1.7% drop or a $6 drop in a very short period of time. The VIX also spiked from 29.89 to 32.77 at the same time. And what caused this arguably unnatural sell off? That\u2019s a great question. At the time the only notable news was that expected home sales had a massive miss. But you will not sit here and tell me that after 3 weeks of the markets not giving a flying F about CPI, PMI, or any other actually important economic data that they all of a sudden cared today? Sus...  \n   \n \n\nThen the lovely which if you didn\u2019t catch it here it is fb \u201coopsies.\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhjlabigs5w81.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb7e9c2f3014e50cb9cf5653ec4b09e9db357eae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rcxxkt0hs5w81.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da53071790cea012f152748b115cca532a8f632c\n\nYes you are reading that correct\u2026 that\u2019s BLOOMBERG\u2026 fricken Bloomberg \u201caccidentally\u201d tweeting a massive miss for META earnings. And not only that! But they tweeted the INCORRECT data\u2026 yeah that data was old. How does one manage to post not only incorrect data but also post it in the middle of the day when no one ever releases earnings\u2026 yeah a little sus if you ask me. \n\nNow why was this important? Ah yes let me tell you why\u2026 So the market had opened bullish af. Tanked on the bullshit at 1015am\u2026 and FINALLY recovered all the way back to green and made a new HOD! Yay SPY!. Well right after making the HOD is when that piece dropped at 1pm. And that changed the whole dynamic for the rest of the day. I don\u2019t like to scream manipulation or anything but im telling you that someone fucked with the market on purpose today and they won. Oh yeah someone just so conveniently LOADED to the tits with puts RIGHT BEFORE the new dropped\u2026 sus? I mean come on. \n\nOverall after SPY recovered from its morning dip it was setting the stage full steam ahead for an afternoon rally and I have no doubts it was shooting for 425-426 EOD. But that meta new not only tanked meta itself to be down 5% at one point but took the rest of the market down with it. I know nothing will ever come from this but this is the type of day that breaks the spirits of a day trader. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ohnw4mhs5w81.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b73e55cd522928c7a143546c643f6f3734e17b97\n\nSo where are we? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/curvcj6is5w81.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ce2d9a2245054e95c6bfefb84ea0367cadf9f1c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6f48gomis5w81.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1525667c63346434bda1d4f628e1a5fb00641f4b\n\nWell meta absolutely KILLED IT tonight on earnings. I called it out in my server but I did not play it myself but I called it out that meta was going to be a call not put play. It got beat down so aggressively over the last week there was no way they would tank it anymore. \n\nSpy as you can see is reacting VERY positively to that news. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6uckw3js5w81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450ba653ce6a03603b232b1f5a9ae3b91d2c9cbe\n\nThe daily chart on SPY has never looked so bullish. I wanna point out the blue arrows to you. So you can see I highlight two from March and then today. What do you see there? Especially the one from March 8th (the first blue arrow)\u2026 you see a massive sell off that ended at 415 AND had a long ass wicked candle. What did it do the next day? It rallied like no one elses business. \n\nSo for instance March 8th closed at -0.76% (with an intraday range of 2.9% or $12 of movement). The next day it had a 2.68% green day. \n\nMarch 14th closed at -0.73% (with an intraday range of 2.1% or $8.76 of movement). The next day it had a 2.20% green day.\n\nThose of you that follow me know ive been having a working theory of a sideways channel from 415 to 458 for a little while now. This would secure that channel with now 4 supports. Yes someones gonna scream it cant be a channel if a candle breaks it! Well it can actually. Its called an outlier. And that candle right there is from the day the Russia war took off. So that\u2019s really an outlier.\n\nNow the resistance we have 7 candles rejecting off of it with two outliers above it. Something I am definitely watching for sure. \n\nOne thing I do see and know though is that 415 yesterday and today and last month held as great support. Tomorrow which we are above now resistance will be 420. From there we paint the path to 428 which is the daily 8ema and next major resistance. Believe it or not I truly think its doable tomorrow. It would take a large 2.5% day but that\u2019s honestly easily obtainable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssivworjs5w81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2032d9004a32a96abb8668b5b4f7eccdee08c3db\n\nThe VIX never really found its groove today. It supports the sideways range day for sure as we just couldn\u2019t really get a direction established and after a very strong ADX yesterday it was very weak all day today. However, its important to note just how high the VIX is. The vix does not usually stay in this range. Its happy place is down close to 19-20 for the last few months. The VIX is more like to unravel from these levels and cause massive bull runs when it does. Arguably at open today when the VIX immediately dropped and spy rocketed too that was setting the tone for the day. But it was unable to hold below the 30 level and reach 28. With Meta killing earnings and 32 being clearly the top for VIX right now, I think we will see this unwind tomorrow and will see the bull rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xon9szbks5w81.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1aa62485dee2eeffc0e1e6fe9b8c0a807b9671\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzeludrks5w81.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e69d67554a66438d0e9e9b82daf12f10b2a46b\n\nApple is still well within its bear channel right now. However, it bounced off support today once again at 155. The daily and 15min bear channel supports were tested and held perfectly today. I didn\u2019t even have to adjust the yellow bear channel that\u2019s how perfect it was. \n\nNow you note the two candles highlighted on apple and yes you guessed it they coincide perfectly with the SPY candles that resulted in rallies\u2026 So lets dig into these. \n\nMarch 14th Apple finished down -2.66% (with an intraday range of 2.67% or $4.02 of movement) it was followed by a massive green day that was 2.97% green (with an intraday range of 3.45% or $5.19 of movement). \n\nToday had a -0.15% finished (with a total range of 2.83% or $4.41 of movement). So very similar days and ranges. It will be very interesting to see if tomorrow we get that bull rally we are all waiting for. \n\nThe markets MAY make us wait until apple earnings but I have a feeling we are going to rally tomorrow off meta earnings and will look for a follow through rally after Apple beats earnings. I don\u2019t think personally that amazon is going to beat earnings at all. And I dont think the markets will care either to be honest. Look at google today left in the dust -3.75% and was red all day long even when the markets were at the highs of day. \n\nWe will find out in the morning when we wake up how pre market and Europe digests everything but again if I ever was a betting man despite all the fuckery afoot on a markets direction tomorrow being green I feel fairly confident in. \n\nThe one thing that will change that is if markets for some reason don\u2019t digest overnight meta well, or the VIX for some ungodly reason spikes back to 32-34 before open. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4w4t8els5w81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b88d321b399d449ef1e97236efe07972311a5748\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to add QQQ tonight just cause im running outta steam here and my heads killing me but I wanted to point out the exact same candle set up on QQQ that SPY and Apple has\u2026 And see how wild that swing up was the next day. Just something to keep in mind. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThis week honestly has been really rough for me. I took a major loss Monday (once again on a bs reversal that was like 1% in 30minutes) and yesterday finally recovered to green on the week. Intraday today I had a good call in the morning for 11%. I then entered another call at the perfect moment before spy dropped the 1.5%. I with conviction or stupidity held from -80% all the way to 5% to -40% back to 10% before I finally sold right before the 1pm sell off. That was a rough time for sure. I also then took another 2dte call that went against me and I got out a 1% thankfully. \n\nAs you can see I ended up closing my MSFT lotto for -10% it was a very small position. At open I was up about 5% and then it immediately went red so I just bailed while I could. Of course had I held I woulda been up a lot when it hit that 5-6% at one point. But I had no belief it would rally that hard intraday. \n\nSo that\u2019s the good. The bad is I also entered some calls around 230 when I expected the bull trend to continue and immediately saw a drop and red action. So I am currently holding those right now over night. I am holding way move over night then I care to do but I think by EOD tomorrow I should be able to exit everything green. \n\nCall (msft lotto) 3 dte -10%\n\nCall 0dte 11%\n\nCall 0dte 11%\n\nCall 2dte 1%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vfe0mi9ms5w81.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5f466edc0124c1c637cf5f9bcc6951bfe009d54\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pl08apms5w81.png?width=423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0313978b2a1e448171b23afd5d6822ed53e703ac\n\nRealistically I don\u2019t have too far to go on these\u2026 For the 2dte 422C on spy I only need to see 424 intraday tomorrow to see any green. That is very much so doable for SPY tomorrow.   \n The 428c lotos from last week are pretty much smoked I need something like 434 by Friday which is pretty doubtful. My goal will be to close those EOD tomorrow or intraday around 50% if I get the chance. \n\nThe Apple 165C has a breakeven of 161.3 which is very doable for apple in one day. Itll be tough but its doable. Depending on how im feeling and where those are tomorrow night and what market is doing I MAY hold the apple as a lotto over night for earnings. I haven\u2019t decided yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odkdxoons5w81.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4864df80d99e5df06eb5361eebd2396c95603a43\n\nAnd of course cant forget the hyperwheel that still haunts me as I sleep at night. The good news is im holding the futures contracts still so as long as we get some green under neath us we will be good to go and I will quickly see profits return there. But that -14% hurst a lot to see.",

    "selftext": "**Respected Traders and Investors,**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSobbing and crying :\\_(\n\nI\u2019m sorry guys. I think I let you all down. This understanding of the stock market that i had in my head that fundamental analysis is nothing compared to technical analysis and i could just cut all the background noise by just simply looking at the charts. I thought, why in the world should I crunch numbers that these Wall Street HFs and institutions try to do. I\u2019m so better than this. So I keep going to bars and having drinks, partying all night, using tinder, etc, thinking when an exit liquidity rally to ATH comes about in July-August 2022, I will short the entire market. And soon Wall Street will remember me as the only guy who saw it all coming to the perfect date.\n\nSo I created this illusion in my head that in Q4 2022 we will 10000% get our recession because the liquidity in the market was starting to decrease. So I told literally every huge player on Wall Street about this macro idea. I also try to impose my thoughts on each one of you that in Q4 we will have a recession.  But I got so deluded into my illusionary world that I never tried to calculate could we be early to a recession even before Q4. \n\nNow, it turns out, we could. 2Q of -ve GDP could come by July. Its a 50% chance though. Meaning if it happens i ain't gonna get the glory for this crisis. Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry are. So im gonna piss off in the corner writing this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets quickly recap how it all unfolded this week, but before we do that lets look at the prediction we did beforehand for the most crazy week in my last post.\n\n  \n\n\n[Earnings went horrible, hence Case 2 is being followed.](https://preview.redd.it/6g78v16b00x81.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a5b3fc8938ad33265022ed285ed637ad47787f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Earnings season :**\n\nAs we all know this week, earnings were going to be the most important one going forward for Q2 because 5/6 megacaps carried $8T in S&amp;P500. We also had GDP no coming out on Thursday, as we discussed in my last post. Lets see how it all went.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tech Earnings Season](https://preview.redd.it/ah5otfma10x81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1405b4fa92b679c534e704f4e658937cb8ddfc72)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 25 ( Monday ) : Coco-cola Analysis**\n\nMonday was pretty brutal for Asian Markets because China was further going into lockdown. We also had a palm oil ban on exports. But in the USA something happened. DXY went up, but the bonds yields went down, meaning people were buying USA bonds for safe havens or maybe dumping Chinese bonds for the USA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[KO Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/6abdl35r10x81.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e104c2f19b2a66953b5eca0791ee13b54eb3e4)\n\nWhen Cocola earnings came out they beat est. because they had raised prices of their drinks and were kinda flaunting corporate greed on the balance sheet, or some might argue, they were just preparing themselves for recession or stagflation.\n\nSo the stock rallied monetarily for the day and had a positive effect on the stock market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[KO T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/f4vvws6320x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efff82a22fde6f90dfa592d793cf4243a4b2e0a0)\n\nAs for technicals, you can clearly see in the 1hr chart the stocks had what you call \"Bearish divergence\" and then the stock went down to test lower levels later on in the week when everything was getting hammered.\n\nIf the candles start closing below the white line then the buy zone for dip buying would be the green lines, which are close to 1.618.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 26 ( Tuesday ) : Microsoft and Alphabhet ( Good cop bad cop )**\n\nBoi oh boi this day will be remembered by many people in the upcoming months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/gzt1xcxn30x81.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=198cd7f826b6f836065df8033534ebb92d946127)\n\nMicrosoft kickstarted the show with a beating est. Hence stock rallied. They too had earnings quite similar to Coke..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MSFT T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/ey7fso5v30x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e25ef0eb1ab175a74c28b0d8a581baf5e5478703)\n\nAs for technicals, well, the earnings were great so im not expecting a 1.618 but just 1 fib guarantees for the ABC correction wave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GOOGL Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/9ohl93m640x81.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53b27e63405637e4f0c695aeec6727ed2c786c79)\n\n \n\nBot now came the google earnings in after hours. Markets had gone up because of Microsoft. Everyone got confident, well Google is the most profitable business on the planet. Surely they wont miss anything. But revenue and net income came below exp. Youtube got hit badly by advertising. Maybe people are going out more often and don't watch YouTube that much more as was the case in the pandemic. Also, finance YouTubers are doing horribly badly.\n\nBut the company announced a dividend in the form of a share buyback of $70B, but the market was still not happy. The stock dropped -5% in post market hours.\n\nBut visa earnings came quite well, so the market was gonna be in a jolly mood the next day because  transactional revenue was growing, meaning people were buying the dips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GOOGL T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/1so6uh4w40x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c41a2ed50046c7d5349da599826a926a7517aa9b)\n\n \n\nAs for technicals, the 1.618 in the ABC correction wave is coming 100%. The price action looks so weak that im not even bothering to use divergences. Just keep buying this stock at support levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 27 ( Wednesday ) : Meta Paypal Pinterest Qualcomm ( Pack of 4 )**\n\nOh these guys, im not gonna bother with their charts or balance sheet because everything was pretty simple in their balance sheet and T.A.\n\nWell Meta is kinda based on the principles of Netflix. Only subscribers matter. So daily users increased, but monthly users didn't. EPS went up, and also the stock was already beaten that badly it had no choice but to go up.\n\nPaypal kinda had earnings like Visa. Transactional revenue was growing.\n\nPins as Meta was beaten up bad. It beat estimates, monthly users declined, but it went up because revenue per user increased.\n\nQualcomm, I have no idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **April 28 ( Thursday ) : Amazon and Apple**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/9kl9bd6x50x81.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15ec5df4b9853fb74e75575a31946b4cc206ebc)\n\n[AAPL Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/3mcjrf6x50x81.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be191d9f21931c96c2ba2f7914e1cfb1cec3fc6)\n\nThursday was all about Apple and Amazon. Everyone knew before that Amazon would miss earnings because of the Rivian thing and Apple sales were gonna be strong.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nNo one expected Amazon's earnings to come in this horribly. Now reports are coming in that everyone hates Bezos XD. Also, Apple did an outlook thing for Q2 that they will get hit badly because of chips supply chains. Since Q1 earnings are already priced, what better way for Q2 than by shorting the company as directed by Tim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/cuoe18en60x81.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e598b375e2e51a77d373b7b630e46791e2635488)\n\n[AAPL T.A.](https://preview.redd.it/3y02o2en60x81.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e922591b08a5c7a0211381e858d0d6c4b5db32f)\n\nAs for Amazon technicals, surely by know you might have heard of the wyckoff distribution and accumulation. Green box should hold accumulation else it could turn out to be redistribution. \n\nFor Apple, well, in short $138-139 support is coming 100%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **April 29 ( Friday ) : Judgement Day**\n\nThink of it as the day when the court gives its final verdict. Well, the stock market gave one hell of it to investors in a single day. April turned out to be the worst month for markets since 2008's October GFC. S&amp;P500 had its worst four month since 1939 Great depression and Nasdaq since 1970. To everyone's surprise, but hey, not us, we got that -ve GDP print. And by Q4 2022, we will certainly get our recession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Things are only going to get much worse from here. \n\n So why am I saying this. Can't we all just simply short the market and make insane amounts of money in the way down. Turns out it ain't easy as it seems. Now you have got to be dealing with what we call turbulence in the market. We may go up and down, go up and down. Meaning options are pretty much useless in the market. The only choice you have got is swing trading in futures or the normal market.\n\nSo find a favorite youtuber who predicted all the things in the market like Recession, bond drought, commodity shock, stock market crash etc. And if you cant find the guy then how about reading my piece below and heck even sharing with your friends about how this guy was so close to figuring it all out but he was just too damn lazy for wallstreet fast life.\n\n( Don't try to give me a job in Dms unless you're a Warren Buffet. I love flying solo and cleaning the toilets at Black Rock. Yes, i love my job. ) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now we shall discuss the three questions that need answering :\n\n \n\n**Q1 : How much is J powell gonna raise rates.**\n\nSo my readers know how I dont just give out my secrets that easily. I need you all to work too, and come to your own conclusions. So in my last post I gave you all the homework that what was the third observation in the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Homework Chart : Yellow lines : Wage inflation , Red line : CPI inflation , White : FED rate hike](https://preview.redd.it/1vn8aej890x81.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcb1c6c62e6b2af53f83506c3349f5cd1bd4126)\n\nThe answer to that question is FED has to raise rates at least the half of what CPI annualized inflation is, or almost equal to it. Although some might argue the \"Taylor rule\" states, that its actually double, but seriously, my charts don't lie to me.\n\nSo now you all must be wondering okay, so half of say like 8% is 4%. What's the big fuss about. Turns out technically your 4% is gonna go to a maximum of 8% due to IHS and trend lines breaks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6duok8ob0x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d136ac9bb1ccfcc2d4c71b5617bff9a2f51f5d6\n\nSo idk, what fundamental analysis or news comes around will led to such technicals. But the chart is telling me that the 10yr bonds are going to 6 to 8% by 2023, but the terminal rates are still projecting 3.2% by Aug 23. We have got room considering the labor market is robust and strong.\n\nHypothesis 1 : Terminal rates projection will go to 6% by Aug 2023.\n\nHere\u2019s the calculation on how it could.\n\n50X6 = 3% + 0.25 = 3.25% by eoy.\n\n5 X 0.50 = 2.5%\n\nTotal = 5.75%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what impact will it have ?\n\nAlmost certainly you're gonna get recession coz you will be raising rates in a contracting economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[At the end of large cycles we have Recession](https://preview.redd.it/wdrp0i1ec0x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8c1abbf5a3effd16fca362fc109443e055ae0c4)\n\nHypothesis 2 : FED-U turns and doesn't raise rates over 2%\n\nWelcome to Japan, where you keep your bond yields down, inflate the dollar by printing even more and send all your assets to the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : \"Million Dollar Advise\"\n\nLets also look at a GDP chart over here which only the few selected people on Wall Street know about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GDP negative  print vs Stock Market crash](https://preview.redd.it/4z2uis46d0x81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4f8de83709aef26c240cf187fe5acce0fb3a957)\n\nThis chart tells us well the first negative print is priced in the market. Question now remains whether the next GDP no\u2019s are going to be positive or negative. \n\n\\- If we are going to get positive no\u2019s by July then the stock market should go up in Q2. \n\n\\- if we are gonna get that 2nd negative print and complete the definition of 2Q of negative GDP growth, you're talking about -50% in Q2 itself. \n\nSo you have got a lot of number crunching to do with big banks and institutions reading my post. Retailers don't try it. Just keep buying the dip with cash i told you to accumulate. Don't rush in coz, buying stocks, this year is going to be like buying groceries. Or you can just place your first two orders at -30% &amp; -40% and cancel the noise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q2 : How much will Bond get destroyed**\n\nWe have talked about this in \u201c Credit risk america \u201c post that bonds are to be bought b/w May 16- June 16. At least that's what historical technicals in TLT are telling me, which is an iShare 20yr ETF. \n\nAs for 10yr bonds idk guys. This bond is tricky. It follows the terminal rate which is currently 3.2%. My calculation says 6%. So more sell-off, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Terminal Rate](https://preview.redd.it/ood4lc70e0x81.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596d6e54b6360f23d350f75fd52a0489bb19452f)\n\nRemember : iShare is historical pattern and 10yr bonds is current T.A. pattern. One of them will be right. Its either gonna be buying bonds buying at may 15-june 15 or buying bonds at 6 or 8% terminal rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q3 : How much lower will stocks go?**\n\nWell, honestly speaking, we are 100% going into a severe recession coz Jim Cramer said recession is gonna be mild. So -50% from the top.\n\n( We will talk more about this later or you can just check my last post for this )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q4 : What is coming \"Short Recession\", \"Stagflation\", \"Depression\" ?**\n\nFirst will come stagflation coz we money printed so much in 2020. It takes 2yr for full effect of monetary policy plus supply inflation from China, not Russia, because China went into lockdown mode, meaning less demand for oil and gas. Hence they will go down. No comments about other commodity.\n\nNow we are tightening so deflation will come from 2023 to 2025 if the FED went with a rate hike to 4%. We will also get our forgotten depression of 1921 somewhere around here for 1yr, which is also called as longer-lasting recession for more than 1yr. Lets see how it all unfolds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q5 : What's the big deal with Liquidity?**\n\nFor this I suggest first watching Ray Dalio's video about how the economy works.\n\nRemember, HFs have access to a liquidity pool. Then we have pension funds on top of it. And on top of them we have VCs, and on top of them private equity. And at last we have retailers.\n\nThen analyze these charts below and come to your own conclusion. ( These charts are by the author of Capital Wars, who is considered the father of liquidity )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[60 months bond market theory](https://preview.redd.it/e9u4hmoff0x81.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd70903c45482e683792b8599c8a560aa15c9a6b)\n\n[We are currently in turbulence](https://preview.redd.it/ip26rpoff0x81.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e86b69ad5adaa395b8e6d63fa2daf1cf864633f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut how about Q6 that no one of you is asking or thinking about it? This shall be your H.W.\n\nQ6 : What's up with Forex market ? \n\nEspecially japan and euro.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&amp;t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g](https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1511280830739775490?s=20&amp;t=SOPpcPJ3779w1niMvdFf6g)\n\nRemember : Dollar is strengthening, meaning other currencies will lose its value more in dollars if they are not starting the tightening cycle. Hence JPY is getting destroyed. For Euro, well, wars and recession make it bad for investors to hold the EURO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo again with lots of love. Keep enjoying your time. Remember to take the vacations in May like institutions would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\nSorry for ending weirdly. I'm a weirdo, who is tired. I wanna go back and watch my animes and shows until institutions and HFs destroy my wonderful America. Don't know whose orders they are operating, but it all seems like a planned attack on liquidity.\n\nRegards\n\nUchiha",

You\u2019re playing GTA 5 and you really want that Zentorno (for those who don\u2019t know what this is, your childhood sucked and I feel sorry for you. It\u2019s a car.).\nSo you spend 10 bucks on a Shark Card (It\u2019s like a ticket to redeem for GTA dollars, you poor bastard) and you buy your Zentorno.\nThere\u2019s a limit to how much money you\u2019re gonna spend on a virtual car that you\u2019ll never sell and that can be duplicated and gotten for free. In other words you\u2019re not going to spend $100 on it\u2026\nHowever, what if it literally couldn\u2019t be duped. What if you COULD resell it and get some if not more money back than what you paid for it. What if you could export it from the game and store it elsewhere.\nThat is **true virtual merchandise.**\nThat\u2019s the only difference between a digital good and a DC and I ASSURE you with 100% certainty, that all these video game digital goods will be DCs in the near future because they have literally every incentive to do so (Think about all the effort GTA goes through to patch duplication glitches. Making your virtual goods DCs negates any need for this.).\n\n*Time for some quick myth busting before we continue.\n- \u201cYou can screenshot a DC\u201d\nYes, you can screenshot a dumb fucking monkey picture. But you can\u2019t screenshot and drive a Zentorno.\n- \u201cPeople will be able to create cheap Zentorno knockoffs and import them into the game.\u201d \nRETARD. Every transaction history is stored. EVERYTHING. Do you seriously think the developers would allow your shitty Zentorno ripoff anywhere near their game? No, they won\u2019t. And there\u2019s absolutely 0 chance of you ever tricking them. They know with 100% certainty where the real Zentornos came from, where they are currently, how many there are, how many there ever will be. \nThus your ripoff is worthless.\n- \u201cDCs have no utility and are therefore worthless\u201d\nStupid monkey pictures are worthless.\nA Zentorno in a game that people play and care about is NOT worthless. And we know this because people spend money on them already with 0 chance of seeing that money again. There IS value in virtual goods and that is a fact.\n- \u201cIf they made the Zentorno and other cars into DCs, they would just be used as speculative investments\u201d\nWrong. Stop associating DCs with JPEG moon-boi scams.\nThe cars will be the same as before, their value might fluctuate but nothing too crazy. There probably will be some super expensive super rare cars in the secondary market but it really isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Anyone who\u2019s played GTA knows that people love to show off their \u201crare modded\u201d car collection in their garage.\nHaving actual real rarity and value only adds to that experience.\nBesides, the developers will never let that get in the way of the gaming experience, there will always be other more accessible, cheaper, just as good cars.*\n\n\nAlright back to the DD.\nSo we already covered how profitable the micro-transaction business model is thanks to their reoccurring sales (Just like merchandise).\nWe also covered where the video-games still fall short as you can only charge so much for a virtual toy.\nDCs will essentially allow for video-game companies to charge real merchandise prices for their virtual goods and people WILL pay it.\n\n\n\n**So\u2026 Recap!**\n\nRemember Pokemon.\nLicensed merchandise revenue: $82.8B\nVideo-game revenue: $27.1B (18% of which came from a single freemium game with little $1-$10 micro transactions, outperforming all 121 other video-games by a fucking landslide)\n  Just fucking imagine how much Pokemon GO would have made if instead of charging $1-$5 micro transactions, they charged real world merchandise prices of $10-$500. Yeah\u2026\nTheir gaming division will match and **surpass** their merch division (which represents revenue growth of 300% at the very least) and so will every other IP. (I invite you to look at other IPs and compare their merch revenue and gaming revenue. The difference between the two is basically guaranteed growth)\nAdd to that the ease of instantaneous exchange of virtual merch versus the headaches and limitations of exchanging real world merch\u2026 very appealing.\nOh, and did I mention that the gaming industry boasts a clientele of nearly 3 billion people?\n\n**OH! And by the way, all of this isn\u2019t even taking into account the perpetual royalties and fees the gaming companies will be making on literally every single transaction after their DC merchandise hits their secondary markets. Seriously, think about that for a good minute.**\n\nSo that right there is why DCs will cause the gaming industry to absolutely fucking boom\n\n\nAs for a stock pick.\nWon\u2019t be talking much fundamentals here as I want to keep this part short.\nEveryone talked about Facebook Meta during the MetaV hype train.\nI\u2019m looking at Microsoft though.\nI think MSFT is a no-brainer buy right now. \nThey want to focus more on the gaming industry.\nThere\u2019s a reason why they bought Activision Blizzard at the time that they did. \nThey now own World of Warcraft which is basically a metaV in itself (MetaV and DCs go hand in hand).\nAs a company that already has a huge established presence in both hardware and software for gaming, I believe that they are the best positioned blue-chip to take advantage of this industry boom that\u2019ll inevitably come.\n\nEdit: Credit to u/ic___fl21 , u/brickhouse1013 and u/silver7una all made a great points in the replies about advertising. Social media level ad revenue right there.\n(I\u2019d copy and paste their replies here but my shit internet won\u2019t allow it)\n\n\nTL/DR: The micro transactions business model beats the traditional game sale model by a landslide thanks to perpetual reoccurring sales. \nHowever you can only charge so much for a virtual toy or power-up.\n\u201cDigital collectibles\u201d (read the disclaimer at the top) will allow gaming companies to combine the power of reoccurring sales with the higher real world prices of merchandise which will enormously boost revenue.\nAdd the perpetual royalty fees on every single transaction.\nMSFT to the moon.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold fellow ape. I love you.",

    "selftext": "First of all, this is a new account\nTransitioning from my old one. Thank you for being an understanding and loving community.\nAlso, I feel like this will be a long read. So there will be a TL/DR at the bottom.\nAlso a link to part 2 can be found at the bottom.\n\n**DISCLAIMER: There will be lots of mentions of \u201cdigital collectibles\u201d (You know, those digital ape pictures that people have been flipping. But I can\u2019t say the word otherwise the bot will tell me to go to the sister subreddit, but this DD post won\u2019t fit in there) in this 2 part post, however this DD is strictly meant for publicly traded Gaming companies and how \u201cdigital collectibles\u201d will affect their revenue and STOCK price.\nIt would be no different if I made a DD post about Facebook/META since they can be considered a metaV/\u201cdigital collectible\u201d company now.\nWhenever I mention \u201cdigital collectibles\u201d I\u2019ll using \u201cDC\u201d for short.**\n\nOk god I\u2019m so excited for this.\nPrepare to see video-game companies\u2019 revenue skyrocket in the next few years boys. Yes, this is a long term play. If you\u2019re a day trader, then you should probably stop reading here and go watch some tiktok as it\u2019ll suit your short attention span.\n\nThe gaming industry has evolved a ton since the days of pong and companies have found more and more efficient ways of monetizing their products.\nWe\u2019ve seen our favorite games go from arcades, to home consoles with cartridges and discs, to downloadable games, to freemium (believe it or not, freemium games are giga money makers thanks to micro-transactions. More on this later), to basically nice and predictable subscription based revenue streams (Not really subscriptions but I\u2019m talking about battle passes and stuff like that. So pretty similar).\nWhat\u2019s the next step for gaming revenue?\nDCs. \n\nNow\u2026 I know. DCs are gay.\nBut shut your little ape brains off for a second and bear with me here.\nI know a thing or two about how this shit works. I\u2019ve been YOLO\u2019d in a DC company since before DCs had a buzzword. I\u2019ve gone straight to the moon and came right back down to earth with rest of you magnificent retards and the only reason none of you have seen any of my glorious gain/loss porn is because r/wallstreetbets doesn\u2019t allow those posts here and I respect the rules. But trust me, I\u2019ve got screenshots for the day the mods choose to allow it, and I think they\u2019ll allow it once they realize how closely linked these two investment vehicles will be.\n\n\nWhen you hear \u201cDC\u201d, you probably think: Shit JPEG made by some college kid to help pay for his gender studies degree.\nCongratulations you\u2019re a normie.\nHere\u2019s the truth. You\u2019ve been buying DCs since the day your mom bought you your XBOX live subscription.\nAny time you ever bought a Fortnite skin, a Shark Card on GTA, fucking gems for Clash of Clans\u2026 you bought an \u201cDC\u201d.\nPeople have been spending money on digital goods for years now. And companies know this. Companies LOVE this. \nWhy do you think freemium games are so prevalent?\nFortnite\nPUBG (literally forced to go freemium in order to compete with Fortnite)\nCOD Warzone\nAmong Us\nPokemon Go etc.\nBest part is, they don\u2019t even have to be \u201cpay to win\u201d micro transactions. \nFortnite literally only sells pointless cosmetics and that\u2019s the game\u2019s whole business model.\nAnd it fucking works like a charm. How well does it work? I\u2019m going to show you right now.\n\n\n**Case study**\nLet\u2019s do a quick freemium game business model case study with Pokemon Go:\n\nPokemon, literally the largest IP in the world topping the charts with over $110B \ngenerated since the creation of the brand.\nNow where does that $110B come from?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises\n\n* Licensed merchandise \u2013 $82.805 billion\n* Video games \u2013 $27.145 billion\n* Box office \u2013 $1.85 billion\n* Home entertainment \u2013 $830 million\n* Strategy guide books \u2013 $142 million\n* Jet aircraft livery sales \u2013 $3 million\n\nWe\u2019re going to focus on Licensed merchandise ($82.8B) and Video games ($27.1B).\n\nWhy do you think licensed merch generated SO much more than the video games?\nWell, licensed merch has 2 things going for it: \n1- Merch (Toys, cards, collectibles, clothing etc.) is generally sold at a premium compared to video-games. Most fans would drop $20 on a cool Pikachu shirt without batting an eye.\n2- This is the big one. Reoccurring sales.\nThe people that buy merch, very rarely if ever only buy one object. They usually have 12 statues, 2 or 3 folders full of trading cards, many t-shirts and hats etc. I like to call these people \u201cwhales\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the video-games now cause this is where it gets interesting.\nWhen you buy a video-game, you only ever buy 1 and that\u2019s it. \nNow you might have bought many different Pokemon games\u2026 (each of those takes lots of money to develop BTW in comparison to printing Pikachu on a shirt) but unless your game breaks, you\u2019re not gonna buy 2 cartridges of the exact same game. \nAnd that\u2019s where the video games have fallen short up until recently.\n\nPokemon has made a total of 122 video games that have generated a total of $27.1B over the years.\nNow out of all those games there is ONE that stands out. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s Pokemon Go. Remember that game that you and your friends all downloaded and played for like 2 months until the game died? Well guess what you little bitch, it didn\u2019t die. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s still going strong to this day.\nPokemon GO has generated over $5B since its launch (keep in mind this is data from 2021 so it\u2019s actually more.) \n\nhttps://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-five-billion-revenue\n\nPokemon GO ALONE represents over 18% of that $27.1B of video game revenue\u2026\nThis one little mobile game managed to surpass all 121 other Pokemon games so fucking much that it doesn\u2019t even make sense. Except it does make perfect sense: Micro-transactions.\n\nI seem to be having trouble posting this so I\u2019ll have to cut it to 2 parts.\nThere will be a link to part 2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uijc4e/alright_time_for_a_dd_post_mark_my_words_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).\n\nTL/DR: The micro transactions business model beats the traditional game sale model by a landslide thanks to perpetual reoccurring sales. \nHowever you can only charge so much for a virtual toy or power-up.\n\u201cDigital collectibles\u201d (read the disclaimer at the top) will allow gaming companies to combine the power of reoccurring sales with the higher real world prices of merchandise which will enormously boost revenue.\nAdd the perpetual royalty fees on every single transaction.\nMSFT to the moon.\n\nEdit: Having trouble posting PART 2. Fucking shit internet. Will get it up asap.\n\nEdit 2: alright PART 2 is up\u2026",

    "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nGreetings you filthy animals! I'm the guy who made this [Inverse Cramer Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/) (which is beating the S&amp;P by 20% YTD, not to brag...). I asked what you wanted to see next in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/), and the top comment was a portfolio invested in stocks mentioned on South Park. So I sent my wife out for a nice date night with her boyfriend and got to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Question**\n\nCould a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Or is it?](https://i.redd.it/uw8lbkyqz1z81.gif)\n\n**The Data**\n\nI originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Strategy**\n\nBeing mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Positions**\n\n| 2000-12-13|\u2018DENN' || 2000-12-13 | \u2018DENN' || 2001-11-07 | \u2018DIS' || 2003-04-30 | \u2018CPB' |\n\n| 2004-11-03 | \u2018WMT' || 2006-10-04 | \u2018BBY' || 2008-03-19 | \u2018CHH' || 2008-04-16 | \u2018SBUX' |\n\n| 2008-10-29 | \u2018BBY' || 2009-03-11 | \u2018DIS' || 2009-03-25 | \u2018AXP' || 2009-10-07 | \u2018CMG', \u00a0'MCD', \u00a0'TWTR' |\n\n| 2009-10-21 | \u2018WWE' || 2009-11-04 | \u2018HOG' || 2010-03-24 | \u2018TWTR' || 2010-10-13 | \u2018TWTR' |\n\n| 2010-11-03 | \u2018NKE' || 2010-11-10 | \u2018NKE' || 2010-11-17 | \u2018PGR' || 2011-04-27 | \u2018AAPL', \u00a0'BBY' |\n\n| 2011-05-18 | \u2018FDX' || 2011-11-02 | \u2018Red Robin' || 2012-10-03 | \u2018WMT' || 2012-10-10 | \u2018AMZN', \u00a0'UPS' |\n\n| 2012-10-31 | \u2018NKE' || 2012-11-07 | \u2018DIS' || 2013-11-13 | \u2018SNE' || 2013-11-20 | \u2018MSFT', \u00a0'SNE' |\n\n| 2013-12-04 | \u2018MSFT', \u00a0'Red Robin' || 2014-10-15 | \u2018LYFT', \u00a0'TSLA', \u00a0'UBER' || 2014-11-05 | \u2018TWTR' |\n\n| 2014-11-12 | \u2018BBY' || 2014-12-03 | \u2018TWTR' || 2014-12-10 | \u2018TWTR' || 2015-10-14 | \u2018YELP' |\n\n| 2016-09-21 | \u2018TWTR' || 2016-09-28 | \u2018TWTR' || 2017-09-13 | \u2018TWTR' || 2017-10-11 | \u2018NFLX' |\n\n| 2017-10-25 | \u2018ROST' || 2017-11-08 | \u2018BYND' || 2017-11-29 | \u2018NFLX' || 2018-12-05 | \u2018AMZN' |\n\n| 2018-12-12 | \u2018AMZN' || 2019-10-02 | \u2018AAPL', \u00a0'DIS' || 2020-09-30 | \u2018Build-A-Bear', \u00a0'VIAC' |\n\n**The Results**\n\nUm....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Move over Cathie...](https://preview.redd.it/y9mvvf9sz1z81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787394f8282dd952b361e632aaa3466d43cb5456)\n\nSouth Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&amp;P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to \"buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic.\" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIdk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?)\n\nDespite losing my grip on reality a little, this was really fun! Let me know what strategy I should test next!\n\nP.S. Don't ask me where to invest in this. Find it yourself.",

    "selftext": "Buckle up for long post. Lets get straight into the topics:\n\n**Situation: as known to many of you**\n\n1) Inflation - Peaked? Don't think so. CPI data for month of May is out to be released June 10th, placed before the FED meeting. Get out of your mom's basement and take a look at the soaring gas prices. I think, this is the highest right now for gas prices. Food and other costs does not seem to have gone down either. So we can expect another high inflation number for month of May, released in June (&gt;8%) \n\n2) In the past, only way out of SPY slump was easing the interest rates (2019 after 2018 rout, 2020, 2009 etc). Given the inflation is very high and unemployment rate is at a 50 year low, Powell will continue to stay very aggressive on the rate hikes. This is not going to be favorable for stocks. Refer to my post from months ago about effect of rate hikes to stock prices. I will probably need to recalculate the estimates in the earlier post to account for even higher rate hikes --- adjust downwards of course. \n\n**Strategy:**\n\n**Put Debit Spreads ....** yes that's it. Buying puts simply are more risky. Put debit spreads reduce premium and put a cap to the max profit. For example, when most of the market makers were jacking off to SPY rallying up to 450 back in end of March 2022 (for no reason) I bought SPY 450-440 put debit spread expiring May 20 (after FED meeting) for 2.70$ per contract. Sold those for $8.00 (\\~200% profit) at early May.... \n\n**price/expiry/spread/quantity tactics:** Buying put debit spreads when SPY is going upwards (for no reason, without positive news) is the time to buy, and HOLD. My contract value went to 2$ at some point, but I held as the reasoning was clear for me. For expiry this is best if you give 4-5 weeks for strategy to play out.  As for how big of a spread, I prefer 10, this gives maximum value of $1000 if strategy plays out. I typically try to sell at 80% profit before expiry. Quantity for you? Really depends on how much investments you got in the market and are trying to hedge. Accordingly you can buy quantity of put debit spreads contracts. \n\n**Reasoning why it works: Warning, this only works in your favor if you are invested in the market like I am (like invested in SPY, VOO, MSFT, AAPL kind of stocks). For this example lets assume about $15k of  investments in large cap, small cap, stocks/funds.** \n\nScenario 1)Market declines: If the market declines 5% (which constantly keeps happening) you are down 750$. Now at the same time, towards expiry the put debit spread has gained in value and closer to maximum profit of 730$ (assuming a 10 point spread like 450-440 SPY, bought at 2.70$ per contract).... Note the spread gains value towards 1000$ very close to expiry, suggestion is to sell at 80% profit. In this case you will be up .8\\*730 = $584. Hence this minimizes the overall losses to 750-584$ = 166$. \n\nScenario 2) Market is up 5%: This rarely happens these days...Even if it does stay up while the put debit spread is expiring, your investments are up 5% by 750$. And assume put debit spread gone to 0$, expiring worthless... in this case you are up by 750-270 = 480$. \n\nScenario 3) Market stays flat....this is never the case in these times. Even if it does, this is why it is beneficial to buy the spreads atm (at the market) price and not deep OTM. This way if strategy doesn't play out, you can still time the highs and lows in the days putting a limit order. \n\n**Why this strategy and not just DCA?**\n\nThere is a legitimate and serious concern that SPY may go to 300-350$ in the coming months if it hits bear markets. More of not \"if\" but rather \"when\" it hits.  I do not want to run the risk of losing my investments by such a large percentage, and hence hedging seems to be the best option at the moment. Of course keep cash on the side and invest as it allows. And, given the conditions, buying these spreads and selling at 50-80% profits seems to be the best strategy. \n\nPositions: SPY 400-390 Put debit spread expiring June 21st (why? this is after CPI data and FED meeting, although I feel FED meeting may not cause much issue, as Powell announces everything upfront). Bought at $3.21 per contract, already up 60% as of right now). \n\nThere is a good chance of bull run to 420$, could add more if that happens. I wish it happens really and these debit spreads goes to ZERO..... I will be more happy to see my investments go up and not worry about hedging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my post from 4 months back for interest rate hikes projecting this market downturn with price targets: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdb3qh/rate\\_hikes\\_and\\_how\\_it\\_affects\\_stocks\\_watching\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdb3qh/rate_hikes_and_how_it_affects_stocks_watching_for/)",

Bravo.*\n\n**TLDR**\n\nInteresting  \"blended user portfolio\" from this newsletter I receive, shows a  combination of oversold tech/\\[forbidden word\\] and traditional defensive  positions. Also, LOL for the \"collar\"...\n\nJokes aside, this is interesting insofar as it can have some convexity:\n\n* **Bull case**: Tech is heavy oversold will rebound, treasuries are not expensive and will stay flat\n* **Bear case**: Treasuries and Gold (and defensive equities) can offset further falls in riskier assets\n\nWhich  points to a very interesting situation: the classic risk parity  portfolio has been destroyed and it's heavily oversold. Even Gold is  heavy down.

Here is a list of the most  common approaches we hear when talking with other TOGGLE users.Also remember that Fed Minutes come out today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5lwwn6odm191.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcc80f0b68e76bbf708d64e9f6f619a37d71c2ff\n\n&gt;**The** **Treasury Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The safe-haven investor is going all-in into Treasuries. They believe that the Fed will be able to hike only so much and are happy to get \\~3% from 10y US Treasuries and \\~3% implied inflation from TIPS.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Staples Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Remember when Walmart rallied in Q4 of 2008? The Staples Investor remembers. This investor is pivoting to safe equities like staples, real estate, utilities and possibly energy. Recession or not, we need to eat, to rent and to turn on the lightbulbs. See you at the next recovery, they are confident they will be up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dividend Seeker**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dividend Seeker is close in style to the Staples investor. With a nice drop in markets, dividends are becoming compelling again and the Dividend Seeker is looking for 4%+ dividends to weather the storm  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Call Underwriter**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Call Underwriter owns a portfolio of equities and sells calls against it. Like the Dividend Seeker, they want yield. They do not believe equities will appreciate during the downturn, and seek the extra carry provided by selling premium.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Tech Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Tech Investor is the new incarnation of the Staples Investor. Maybe 20 years ago Walmart was the safe choice, but the Tech Investor believes that now it\u2019s Big Tech that is a safe choice. AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT are all infrastructure plays and they\u2019re here to stay.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Short Seller**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The short seller believes in doom and gloom and will use inverse ETFs or even put options to stay short the market. \u201c*The downturn has just begun, just wait till QT starts!*\u201d said one of our most bearish users.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note: QT is Quantitative Tightening, the unwind of QE.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Cash Hoarder**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Cash Hoarder thrived in a time of low inflation and reasonable real rates. Now they are facing a real challenge as real rates for short term bonds are deeply negative, and they are thinking maybe about moving to Japan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note \u2018cash\u2019 here is used as a synonym for T-Bills of 3M or lower tenor.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dollar Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dollar Bull knows how markets work during a recession. When the global economy falters, money flows back to the big ole US of A. The Dollar Bull is not unlike the cash hoarder, but they have a cross-currency view of things - and will pounce back on oversold foreign holdings one day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull has discovered that a popular asset class cannot escape correlation with the equity market. After \\[forbidden word\\] suffered yet another 60% drop from peak, the \\[forbidden word\\] investor is eyeing that $29.7k level from July 2021 and thinking \u201cwill it breach or rebound?\u201d.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**he Gold Bug**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Gold Bug knows that the precious metal is where the buck stops. Come hell or high water, recession or inflation, Gold is the ultimate safe haven. Russia war? High inflation? Recession? Gold is the answer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Conclusion**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many valid approaches to invest for safety during a slowdown. If we blend together all these styles we get a defensive portfolio made of Treasuries, High Dividend / Defensive stocks, Gold, some \\[forbidden word\\] and a collar (i.e. a sold call and a long put).",

Actually its quite comical if you think about it that the market tanked on MSFT earnings forecast adjustment and then recovered but this was the nail in the coffin\u2026 Good stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lldk9v060h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c662bc5b59445c4bcb1a61a363c1cd7894356b5\n\nNone of this was was really market moving data either. I don\u2019t think the Joe Biden speech did the markets any favors as we essentially trade down the whole speech. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iedlnmk60h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86e3e75320bd7d2f90c45324a8b9ad7e61fece34\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1cyl4a070h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=987c531f0db35b6dfc044c3d93c7be4f2cd81381\n\nBulls are pretty much do or die here though as they are back at the support line. Markets stayed pinned almost all day from 1015 am between 412.2 and 409.9. That 409.9 support was hella strong and is something to watch next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gz7cffm70h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8eb70e04adf3bda2630e2c6b3ad82e42f364ac2\n\nThe daily is really tough to get a read on here. We held that key 409.5 support today which also means we once again held the daily 8ema which is seen as bullish. The daily 8ema is now confirmed above the daily 20ema. With yesterdays big green finish and the bullishly engulfing candle we very well should have seen 420s today. However, with that market FUD this morning we took a nose dive seeing our first 1.5% red day since May 18th. \n\nSeeing only one bull day followed up by a bear day we should suspect to see a follow up red day Monday based off the trend. \n\nBull case- Bulls need a massive gap up Monday at open to maintain the integrity of the channel. The bulls would need to open near 412.5 in order to hold support of channel and from there see nothing but green. \n\nBears as long as we open under 412.5 will see this channel support broken. From there they will look to tackle the 409.9 support that just did not want to break today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgu7ru680h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81a1f784eea7a61729b73f66d97813474bc2a52e\n\nThe VIX maintains its downward trend since May 20th and as long as this downward trend continues their should be further upside for SPY. However, today the VIX pretty much just sputtered between 42.9 and 25.9 all day long. The VIX was very much so disconnected from the market today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7br19p80h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=183a71f3677b3c58a7c867b19233ceafffa2fec6\n\nI don\u2019t really speak on volume much in my nightly TA but intraday I heavily rely on VOLSPD and VOLD to guide my trades. Today pretty much all day long both made new lows over and over. When volume is that bearish SPY should be following. We also saw pretty aggressive sell pressure from pretty much open to close yet we did not have the type of follow through on SPY price action wise. Today was a very odd day intraday. Pretty much every candle inversed itself and there was no continuation of trends or candles. It was very choppy. There was 11 (the most ive seen yet) 180 reversals of price action today. With he VIX under 25 that\u2019s unnatural that\u2019s some VIX 30+ level stuff right there. Today overall was a very odd day. It seemed like the Markets were propping it up EOD that 409.9 should have been busted through easily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kl8n6l890h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12f278e46fd584d2aac75698269729d54bf64f6d\n\nWe officially are back to red weekly candles with this close now. We are also seeing that this candle failed to break the weekly 8ema. Weekly wise major support at 406 and major resistance at 415.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxdgjht90h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61aa3213aba0667f276c0288f5d0ad797889635e\n\nEarlier in the week I mentioned that Apple had a gap still well it ALMOST filled it all today\u2026 gap left is 144.34 to 144.46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dolx0zca0h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38636ceaa0877c0db677ff4a48ec6ecc33e8530a\n\nQQQ actually looked extremely strong today despite the rest of the market and actually still has its GAP to be filled from 300.92 to 302.42. \n\nThere is a very likely scenario where we see these both filled on Monday which would mean SPY will break through that 409.9 support. \n\nOverall I usually have a sense of direction going into the next week but I really have no idea where they are going to take this next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6j1nhnua0h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e8992c44f0f1636391eccd93f43a29a77312fa\n\nWe have the big CPI on Friday its pretty expected to think we will see some chop leading up to that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iqxgb4cb0h391.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dad5a54d8b9a984966f41d01b1b3aa74e03d498\n\nLooking at the last few CPI you can see the two days leading up to the release of CPI have historically been VERY bearish especially if you look at the May and April release dates. Also the last 4 CPI release days have been a red day themselves. The way these fed members have been speaking this weak I am not expecting a beat at all on this CPI. I highly expect it to be a big miss. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI went into today with secured weekly profits. I got impatient and made a very costly trade on calls in the morning on one of the fake outs. From there it just never quite got better. I made an EOD put trade that I failed to secure profits on out of pure greed thinking that we would FINALLY break through 409.9 and ended up closing if for a fairly large loss. Through good and through bad im here and im transparent with you guys. Today was a bad day for me. But I look forward to money and starting fresh with a full 5 days. I don\u2019t need to make up for these losses all on Monday. I have plenty of time to do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtysfs3c0h391.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03aa329a77ad9c571a6a1e2163277a16f227ae6f\n\nSee you guys next week!",

    "selftext": "Within the past 9 months many blue-chip stocks have entered the \"Death Cross\" - which is when a stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. \n\nConversely, \"Golden Cross\" is when a stock's 50-day moving average crosses ABOVE its 200-day moving average.\n\nQ. Is the worst over? \n\nHere are a few indications that key stocks may be turning around:\n\n* Tesla's stock which is down 31% for the year, crossed into \"Death Cross\" territory on 5/26/22 where it still lingers. But today, UBS upgraded Tesla to a \"BUY\" and giving **$TSLA** a price target of $1100.\n* Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, recently purchased an estimated $2.1 million worth of Apple and Microsoft options.

This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7",

In case you don't know, in Jan Microsoft announced an all cash purchase of ATVI for $68.7B ($95/share) at the time it was trading around $65 / share and promptly shot up to the mid 80s before settling back down mid $70s.   The only reason the stock was down in the 60s is that it got dragged down by allegations of sexual impropriatey by key people in the company.  The Microsoft news turned it around, but as I noted it quickly came back down.  Why?  Because there's talk that this merger could be blocked by antitrust enforcement.   \n\nI honestly don't buy it:  \n\nEA acquired Codemasters, Playdemic, Glu Mobile\n\nFacebook acquired Oculus\n\nSony acquired Bungie\n\nActivision acquired King\n\nTake-Two acquired Zynga\n\nAn article on Bloomberg dated April 28 says that the $95 per share offer (24% premium) represents risk buyout won't close.  WAIT A MINUTE THOUGH - it's only 24% premium because the stock got hammered leading up to the deal announcement.  I'm guessing MSFT didn't wake up in Jan and decide to buy.  Exactly 1 year prior ATVI was trading mid 90s and only started slumping on sexual allegation issues. \n\nI don't believe antitrust will factor, I think the deal is happening - and it has 1 year to happen  (Jun 23).  So, here was my approach.  I bought 100 shares of ATVI \\~74.98.  I sold a covered call for $1,165 @ 75 strike for Dec 20, 2024.  I can hear your thought process: \"That's 31 months... that's only 15.5% return... that's like 6% per year... that SUCKS!!!\"\n\n\\^ Yes it does.  But that's \\[one of\\] the *worst* case scenarios.  \n\nLet's say the acquisition goes through in June 2023... my shares are gone, and my premium now earned me 14.4% annually.  \n\nLet's say it goes south, and the deal falls through.  The sexual impropriety stuff was just cleared by investigation, but if the stock tanks below my strike, I can easily buy back my call at a fraction, or hang onto it as additional downside protection.  \n\nLast, let's say it goes south, and stock just flounders around or slowly climbs... well then you're right I earned 6% per year and missed out gains.  Oh well. \n\nThere's lots of other strike prices that could include intrinsic value if you want less downside protection and a potentially higher return.  Anyhow, something to think about. \n\nPosition: 100 shares ATVI (74.98 cost) ; 75C20241220 ($11.65 / aka $1,165)",

Regardless of what the Fed does this month, this rally has some legs and will continue for a while, or so the technicals are indicating...\n\nFor context of the reversal manifesting in the Weekly charts, QQQ's look just like SPY \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1hg8thp2ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ff23ad7fe76267e16139bdc1f522c1b3dda2932\n\n**CPC**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ps3gi8w4ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc85e8cf9c1704b2233e1b62c3e7c18bff8134f0\n\nHere's a quick look at the put/call ratio, focus on the blue line (9-day MA).  Notice how June 14th we put in a lower high which coincides with the higher low in the indices this week, then crossing down below the 0.95 line breaking trend and confirming that people are becoming more bullish on the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10Y**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s10fttq16ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d685f1cc31199945aca3240ca54df8d0acc62b\n\nStill inside this rising wedge pattern on bearish divergence in the PPO and somewhat in the RSI.  Will still need to wait it out but it looks like a reversal is coming in both the 10 and 2 year, keeping in mind, we're STILL inverted since like Thursday of last week.\n\nLet's talk BANKS since we're coming up on earnings next week!\n\n**BAC:  Earnings 7/18**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58ma3p1f8ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc928df6038897136505e52b56ce61ed524752a4\n\nBank of America has been in this falling wedge for a while and has recently started to show some bullish divergence in the RSI, not so much in the PPO though.  I think we have a pretty solid floor under us at around $31 which was resistance back in 2019.  We have a gap just above some potential resistance around $34 which I think we hit easily, will deal with the gap when we get there.\n\n**JPM:  Earnings 7/14**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsz06oej9ha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab06934305b15c42978ca614eaf8f5808cfddb7\n\nJP Morgan Chase!  \nJP Morgan Chase!  \nJP Morgan Chase!  \nJPM has also been inside this falling wedge for a while with a bit better defined bullish divergence.  Again a solid floor under us with a nice rejection off of a previous gap left open since Nov. 2020.  Overhead resistance at $117.50-ish I think will be pushed through pretty easily and likely won't see much push back from the bears until the $125 gap.\n\n**GS:  Earnings 7/18**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r68xe8pnaha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac0192b4927c8aa6793a16e89c8c6d94c5b29dd6\n\nI think I'm less confident in this one.  The falling broadening wedge is bullish but I'm not seeing as solid footing as the others at this point, we're kind of in the middle of support/resistance right now and the divergences in the RSI and PPO aren't really as convincing as JPM.\n\n**VIX**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85h8p64abha91.png?width=5744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5767b1fb31bcea6b4c71c31b66f28aa58f36e553\n\nYah, so what, i do TA on the VIX, wanna fight about it?\n\nShowing the 1-hr chart on this one to keep everyone on their toes.  Today we fell out the bottom of this falling wedge with bullish divergence still intact on the RSI, BUT burned through on the PPO, hopefully that trend continues into the PPO.  Lately the money glitch has been buy puts at VIX $25, buy calls at VIX $35 and I'm here to tell you that didn't work today.\n\nKeep an eye on this bastard though, if it claws its way back into this wedge then look for a big fat stinky dump shortly there after.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think Bond investors are flooding into equities right now so we're likely going to see continuation of this rally much to the perma-bear's chagrin.  I wouldn't get too comfortable though if you're long because at any moment they could decide to flood back into bonds as a safe haven, it really depends on that the Fed does at the July FOMC, till then however, I'll be buying the dip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other tickers you retards wanna see, let me know.  I'm planning to do big tech next weekend.",

    "selftext": "Why I am long VIX/ UVXY Calls\u2026\n\nPicture this\u2026 the year is 2022\u2026 we just had the worst 6 months in market history since the 70s\u2026 yet somehow we are magically now having the best start to Q3 since the 80s\u2026 Does that make sense to you? No? Good! Keep reading my friend! \n\nBefore we go any further\u2026 the \u201cYou cant TA the VIX\u201d comments\u2026 don\u2019t hurt you little fingers typing that\u2026 I tend to disagree and believe the VIX is very trending when it wants to be\u2026 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uiq73tjtpua91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fbc8e7740d9fab636584e19a505c3c294d686f1\n\nHere my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?\n\nGreen channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.\n\nOrange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7\n\nYou also see we just broke major \u201csupport\u201d on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven\u2019t made a recent higher high since May 2nd. \n\nTime wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX &gt;25.5.\n\nOkay still with me here? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2z2ewnwpua91.png?width=682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fc57652a416756b8756a97fa38a28a07b0e8404\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqhhvwyxpua91.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc6b6dae50edc2250c6df709f8b84b77d12bafda\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ciodch0zpua91.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f8f1db57303d9b5b5264fbb26c6eb708a033be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sk6wxgk0qua91.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10b37253bc129fb738b57142b287fa7e36d19276\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3yfgozt1qua91.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb93c9d5a1f2fb96b48bcf717d5ca8ea8e81ade0\n\nIF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX \u201cbottom\u201d tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn\u2019t have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. \n\nThis means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. \n\nCurrent positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn\u2019t properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hn683uk2qua91.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5a124b9733a28ba145af30e49193e6987dcee8\n\nWhat does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the \u201cbig one\u201d and see \u201ccapitulation\u201d finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn\u2019t quite seal the deal. \n\nIf my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. \n\nThe one question that we don\u2019t know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. \n\nOn Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT\n\nOn July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google\n\nOn July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.\n\nOn July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel\n\nThe week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven\u2019t already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. \n\nWhat if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss5gzz93qua91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef138f7f50dc86aa4b56e3601b942b9fd77739c3\n\nIF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don\u2019t see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. \n\nAll I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC\u2026 Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July. I think July is about to be capitulation month for SPY and the markets.",

    "title": "$AAPL is the main reason we didn't see a lower leg down today with $SPY",
    "selftext": "First of all, I hope everyone had a good day today.\n\nNow this won't be that technical, because I am not a smart man. I wouldn't be here if I was. But this morning as I was watching $SPY and looking at my puts go up in price at open I was happy for about 5 minutes and then watched as they flipped and went back down. I was watching my list and trying to figure out why this is happening. Probably like most people here, or at least the other people who are highly regarded like me.\n\nWell I found it, partly from other people smarter then me pointing it out. But I did a little work hitting print screen and making some pictures everyone can look at.\n\n[So this was $SPY today.](https://preview.redd.it/j15efj8mygb91.jpg?width=2934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57b33aba4c6841f4a17a4fd8068cf32dcc0d8c4)\n\nNow for the smart people here they know that $SPY is a bunch of different stocks bundle up into one stock people can trade. So if all the stocks in that ETF are doing bad then the ETF will go down. This will also cause it to go up if they are all doing good. Pretty simple right? Well it's not that simple, but it will work for what I am trying to get across.\n\nSo $SPY is an ETF and is made up of a bunch of stocks and those stocks are bunched up into sectors and they are weighted by how much $SPY has invested in each one. The biggest/heaviest one is for technology and you can look it up under $XLK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here I did it for you, this is today.](https://preview.redd.it/kzt8so430hb91.jpg?width=2962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff161fdb9f1abdcc7c6dc1b587cef170e4ef43bc)\n\nIf you wanna check out the full list you can see it here.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/)\n\nIf you don't check it out I will break it down real fast for you.\n\nTech 24.17%\n\nHealthcare 15.17%\n\nFinancial Services 12.92%\n\nConsumer Cyclical 10.28%\n\nCommunication Services 8.84%\n\nThere is other stuff but I am lazy, just click the link and check for yourself.\n\nSo back to $XLK and why it's important. In this group of stocks are a few everyone here knows. But the one I wanna talk about is $AAPL which is 5.90% of the total assets $SPY has invested. That is not just under the tech umbrella, that is everything. It might not seem like a big deal when you see $MSFT is 5.60% of $SPY's assets. But trust me that .30% is a big deal. Here take a look at this chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Does this look pretty familiar to you?](https://preview.redd.it/ub1ux4qe2hb91.jpg?width=2984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1a805de3adf6be9b17a31ff57be4e4cd10d977)\n\nDid you just do a double take? I know I did this afternoon when I was looking at it. This is $AAPL holding up $XLK which is helping hold up $SPY. Another thing to check out is this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I hate $AAPL.](https://preview.redd.it/0z8a1nd43hb91.jpg?width=695&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e082b16b211bcae41a77fc1399cbd3b9870e84)\n\nThat is pretty much it, I already hated Apple for how they treat their customers and force you to stay in their ecosystem. Now I hate them because they are making my puts bleed.\n\nI Hope everyone has a good night and hopefully you learned something.",

    "selftext": "What a great week.. even with CPI day being a bust.. I had one of my best weeks in a while. So lets get to a few market things first before I touch on charts. I saw a really interesting chart today that shows the UMICH consumer sentiment vs the Russel 1000 that shows they are severely diverted from eachother. \n\nWhat does this mean? Well this is the furtherest they have ever been from eachother in the last 30 years. There is still a lot of people out there that thinks despite how far the market has come down that there is still a very long way to go. I would have thought CPI woulda started the next leg down but that is not the case\u2026 lets get into that a little bit. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntef185ersb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=205de0ab1f8401b1fea3bfa422dcde6a13c58da9\n\nYesterday the fed went from \u201cwe will not be doing a 100bps hike\u201d to wow yeah man we really just might do a 100bps hike back today where now its down to a 17% chance of 100bps hike. The craziest thing about this all is if you look at the last CPI it jumped from 8.3% to 8.6% from April to May and JPOW shit himself and the markets did too with a massive 75bps hike that was not expected\u2026 now CPI is up 0.5% HIGHER than previous CPI (more than last time which was only 0.3%) and all of a sudden it doesn\u2019t matter what we do rate hike wise and markets don\u2019t care about 75 vs. 100bps hike? \n\nConfused? Me too\u2026 I touch on this a little below as to what I suspect is the true thing going on. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t339fnversb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79712e9d1e204460a4cb516d7c50ff700396a6fa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywwl1rffrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a66c885ba69022317171ecd97d889ae0a25e885\n\nI mentioned on the CPI night that I think we are experiencing some psyops in the market\u2026 the media is fueling this rollercoaster and we are being led astray for now. It is even more evident by the VIX that the \u201cfear\u201d is being contained right now\u2026 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86mdud1grsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6863b2f55ecccf654fd87d8426b4d53b6f5ff82e\n\nThe VIX daily chart is very telling of current sentiment and that is that nothings going to take us down. After spy had 4 days of red this week and closed out today green for this week SPY is only down $0.72 cents on the week. They were close to closing this week out as a green week. \n\nThis is the lowest close on the VIX since June 8th. Interestingly enough June 8th was the top of the last trend before we crashed. Looking at the vix there is a case that we could see a bounce Monday around 23.9 on the VIX at that support level which would let SPY truly top before we start our next leg down. \n\nI am also now if we break through that 23.9 level under the impression that the markets are going to completely unwind the VIX down to 18-20 level before tesla earnings hit on Wednesday night. Tesla will be the first notable earnings that could move the markets and then the week after that is massive with MSFT, GOOG, APPLE, and META. Not only that but we also have FOMC on Wednesday the 27th and then GDP is on July 28th the next day. That GDP should confirm a recession. \n\nMany of you red my UVXY/ VIX calls post and I do believe I was correct. The one thing I am wondering is if I was wrong on the timing. I suspect markets to panic from CPI to FOMC like previously but I am wondering if markets are going to rally from CPI to FOMC and then once that week of earnings and FOMC and GDP happen markets then panic till the next CPI and FOMC. At this point I think watching for the VIX to hit 18-20 and UVXY to hit 11.5 again to go long on some 30-60dte calls is the way to go. This is the lowest close for UVXY since April 21st interestingly enough. UVXY also has not closed under 11.5 since January. So that will be a key level to watch for next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvek7kpgrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c236e9f122d5c176259d7aee8a1584d9aa7862f2\n\nThe one thing im really watching on the daily is the close of this candle. It is a hanging man LIKE candle but the wick is not long enough. So this could end up like a continuation candle similar to June 23rd instead of a reversal candle like May 17th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om58fu6hrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee04dd25917171850484aaea0cbd89b3863abb7a\n\nThings to note here for a bull vs. bear case on daily and weekly chart. \n\nBull case- despite a bearish catalyst week we managed to close it with a dragonfly doji. Despite all the craziness we saw this week we saw a bullish finish to the week. We got our weekly 372 channel support test/ bounce. On the daily we broke through the red dotted resistance line which means we made a high high. We also close above the daily 8ema AND the daily 20ema for the first time since last Friday.  \n\nBear case- on the weekly we saw a new lower low for the third week in a row and that was also followed by the third lower high too. While we did not confirm resistance there is a VERY large descending wedge forming on the weekly chart. We have enough of the triangle left that there is a case we see a rejection next week followed by a descent below. Despite the bullish close today one could assume the last three days of bullish volume came from OPEX and how much downward OI there was. We now have a daily gap of $1.54 on the daily (note- this gap is actually closer to $2 as the daily movement of SPY never actually hit $379.05 on Thursday despite what the candles say). While historically gaps always fill we still have a 402 gap above unfilled so that is not something you can say anymore. \n\nDaily supports to watch- 382 \u00e0 379 (gap fill) \u00e0 375 \u00e0 370 (channel support) \n\nWeekly supports to watch- 372 (channel support) \u00e0 364 (weekly 200ema)\n\nDaily resistance to watch- 388 \u00e0 390 (downward channel support AND sideways channel support) \u00e0 393 \u00e0 398 \u00e0 402 (gap fill)\n\nWeekly resistance to watch- 388 (ascending wedge resistance) \u00e0 413 (downward channel resistance)\n\nWhat I am watching for is whether we are going to attempt to back fill this gap Monday or Tuesday or whether we are going to break through 390. 390 is a HUGE level for Monday. IF that level is broken then we are actually hella bullish. With no major earnings to really effect the market and no real economic data to effect it either till Thursday at open we just might see a hell of a ripper early next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zggc0vhrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9804cfbd004521003749725d4227a650c72d2392\n\nES daily actually looks a little different than SPYs. I mentioned yesterday that it looked like futures was turning bullish and it appears Thursday might be the temp bottom again. We did see a rejection of that blue dotted support line at 3867 EOD today though but it closed over the daily 8 AND 20 ema for the first time since July 8th (which ironically was top). \n\nI am watching on the daily for Mondays open if we see a red open and we hold resistance at 3850 we will most likely be headed for a back test of that key 3744 support. Sundays night open will be very very important to watch. Anything over 3850 Sunday is bullish for the week. \n\nDaily supports to watch- 3793 \u00e0 3744 \u00e0 3672 (channel support) \n\nDaily resistance to watch- 3850 \u00e0 3915 (channel support) \u00e0 4020\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/305c46dirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=946d2343961418ae9a82028e7630a4d59e9e8239\n\nFutures weekly chart is probably the most bearish of anything I have talked about yet. So it will be curious to see which one plays out. \n\nThe weekly chart actually confirmed the resistance of the descending triangle on Monday and closed with a true hanging man candle. This true hanging man candle has me suspect that we are going to see a retrace come Monday that takes us back down to that 3675 area. The futures charts are more skeptical and bearish then SPY itself. \n\nIf we were to have a mega bull week next week we could see not only the descending wedge broken (any open over 3875 breaks it) we could see the overall downward channel and the overall sideways channel broken. It would take an impressive 7.7% move to do it but with the way the markets are running its not impossible. Or we could see a retest of that channel and rejection which could confirm further downside in two weeks for FOMC/ earnings/ GDP.\n\nWeekly supports- 3830 \u00e0 3675\n\nWeekly resistance- 3875 \u00e0 4136 \u00e0 4165\n\nOverall SPY/ ES I would say I am bullish next week and will be looking to position to be bearish the following week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwvgt6xirsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2140f0ae9ed8cec493e005e038ff089b4b17dbcf\n\nAMD actually had a hell of a great day and week this week. AMD looks to on the daily have established a V shaped recovery at 71.6. My pre-market plan was to go long on AMD after it back tested 79.5 support and then go long with 7dte calls for next week looking for 87 range. I should have done it but I decided to wait. I am hesitant only that the markets are a little irrational right now. Most likely will regret that next week. \n\nDaily supports- 79.5 \u00e0 76.6 \u00e0 71.6\n\nDaily resistance- 83.8 \u00e0 87\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7em8pjjrsb91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a546f501675e7732e435ba25a37d583fd9868007\n\nAMD weekly is in a nice descending wedge too. The weekly candle is a hanging man so that worries me but it should be able to push through if it keeps up the same momentum. Overall we are looking for 87 resistance to be tested next week and to hold that v shaped support line. If we break through 87\u2026 95-98 is on the table for sure. But any retracement below 77 would be noted as bearish omen. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI had a great but boring day today. I did not like the open today as we dumped then ripped and had some wild candles. With the massively green open and UMICH sentiment I knew I was not going to go in until closer to 1030-11. By them we were already at the probable high of day IV wise and I was not going to play anything above that. My strategy is very strict about not going long/ short when SPY hits those levels. I also noticed that IV on SPY and AMD were hella high today and my mid day we got crushed. I watched 384.6 resistance hold all day long and EOD played a nice SPX (my first one) 0dte put scalp off the breakdown and then played a SPY 0dte call once biden was done talking and the volume came pumping in. Overall GREAT day and GREAT week. \n\nThis is actually the highest weekly WIN RATE year to date for me. This week I was EXTRA patient and really waited for my plays and waited for the chart to come to me. It made all the difference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyjmp56krsb91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d897c2a6bc72def7c56986b3035d3b978e6594f\n\nI look forward to a good weekend to rest. I am sitting cash gang over the weekend. I was tempted to go long on SPY calls but decided to stick to what it old myself at the beginning of the month and do no swings. The biggest loss this week came from CPI day. It came from ANTICIPATING a play AND it came from trading while SPY was at the probable IV range. I did not stick to my guns that day and I did not let the chart come to me. I also double down on that loser which became 2x as big of a loser. Doubling down can work when tactfully done\u2026 but most of the time like I have said before don\u2019t add to a loser to make it a bigger loser\u2026 I also took a loss on Monday due to TOS not filling my order completely which is a logistical issue I could not avoid and is part of the risk of 0dtes in the last 15minutes. \n\nOverall great week for me mentally and trading wise. Look forward to the weekend with the fam and seeing you guys back on Monday!",

Advertising may also prove a consumer-friendly way to monetize password sharing.\"\n\nSwinburne, who lowered his price target on the stock from $300 to $220 a share, revealed that the bank will need to see net adds reaccelerate, in addition to signs of traction from advertising and password sharing monetization over the next 12 months in order to revert back to a $300 bull case.\n\nAll in all, the analyst said ARPU growth matters more than net adds, suggesting Netflix will continue to raise prices down the line, in addition to leaning on revenue generated by ad-supported.\n\nRead the full article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-the-good-the-bad-and-the-downright-ugly-as-investors-brace-for-q-2-earnings-153544143.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-the-good-the-bad-and-the-downright-ugly-as-investors-brace-for-q-2-earnings-153544143.html)\n\n**Netflix (NFLX) to report a loss of 2 million subscribers for Q2 after announcing an unexpected Q1 subscriber loss of 200,000 in April.**\n\n**NFLX fell 25% in post-market when news of the Q1 subscriber loss broke.**\n\n**And now trading at $192 (+1.53%) down 68% YTD.**\n\n**How do you think the stock will react this time?**",

Close the puts EOD before FOMC\u2026 save some BP and then buy a put for the next drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3sd3nfwsf6d91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229e41707e95907c0878edf45ba4ebf2576faaa6\n\nThis FOMC will be even more juicy to buy overnight puts (may I recommend SPX 0dte here\u2026) because despite 3 of the four last FOMCs opening red the next day\u2026 granted only one of these was anything significant. Three of the last four FOMCs the following day has been red and the last two have both been -3%+ red days. This FOMC is special because the following day we get the q2 GDP reading\u2026 why does this matter? Because this would be our SECOND negative reading in a row and that would mean we are 100% in a recession\u2026 we should expect at minimum a -1 to -1.5% open Thursday morning. Now will markets dump or will they rip like after CPI? That part im not sure just yet on\u2026 we also have Amazon, Ford, boeing, Ford, Meta and pinterest the day of FOMC\u2026 this can be a hella big bearish catalyst especially if Google and MSFT have bad earning Monday/ Tuesday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rp0982ktf6d91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=651232a916930eadfe01174cf1f66a0e9ec30781\n\n**How markets have played out at 2pm the last 4 FOMC meetings**\n\nNow for January we didn\u2019t have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets\u2026 so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don\u2019t really equate this January one to much since there was no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. (initial run up till 210, dropped under 220 and then peaked at 230, dropped at 235, retested 230pm high at 240 and then by 245pm was breaking the 230 lows\u2026 from there we sold off until 250pm. Rested and then sold off the rest of the way at until 310pm when the bottom was in). \n\nMarch 16th FOMC we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. (235pm bottom is in but retested at 240pm).\n\nMay 4th FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji\u2026 JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (bottom was put in at 235pm) \n\nJune 15th FOMC We got the initial pop of green that was followed by a sell off. By 230pm when JPOW spoke we had found the bottom and from there we ran for 15minutes. This was the first FOMC though where at 245pm we saw a major pullback to where the 2pm candle opened before it then pushed green again to make a new HOD by 345pm. (bottom was put in at 235pm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lwrz3svf6d91.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d26625f758956e94ca08386bf913e06aadc6664d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How I plan to trade FOMC**\n\nHow do we play this? Well assuming this is going to behave similar to the March, May and June FOMCs we are going to take the opening price at 2pm and look for a 1% drop. So lets saw we open at 390. That means are BUY target is 386.1. Now the trick with this is PATIENCE! We CAN NOT fomo in and we CAN NOT get nervous here. The timing HAS to be perfect here\u2026 too early and youll get IV crushed (most likely will still get paid crazy good). The other thing that we have to be careful of is the wildcard market just dumps like January. The one thing I will say is that the January FOMC meeting was a wildcard and the market is much more understanding of FOMC than it was before in January. So I do think we will behave more like March, May and June especially. \n\nOkay so its now 235pm and we have our 1% drop at 386.1\u2026 this is where its dealers choice you can either buy say a 3-5OTM CALL or you can just stick with the try and trued ATM call. We are expecting nearly a 2.8% on average pop here\u2026 now of course that\u2019s basically if you timed it perfectly top and bottom. For me I would safely set a 100% profit order if you entered anywhere remotely close to that 1% drop range and let it ride. You could set a 50% STOP LIMIT order once it gets closer to 100% and then just let it run till at least 245pm before closing it. \n\nThe safest way though is to enter and immediately set a 100% take profit order. To be safe you could set a 50% sell order instead.  \n\nThe one thing to note here is that from 215 to 230pm there biggest IV crush happens along with the biggest fall usually and that is why you have to be careful. \n\nFor those of you who wanna be aggressive AF\u2026 another play here\u2026 and mind you this one is the highest risk of them all\u2026 would be to take 0.5% from the 2pm OPEN price so lets use 390 again\u2026 391.9 would be target\u2026 once that level is hit enter an ATM put\u2026. And then ride that down 1% from the 2pm candle OPEN. So that would be down to 386.1\u2026 This method should net you a nice 50%. But this one is way riskier as you are exposed to IV crush and the way from the top to the bottom of 2pm to 215pm is wild and full of bounces and fake outs. This ones not for the faint of heart. \n\n**What if im wrong?**\n\nOkay what is the wild card here? What if I am wrong? What do we look for\u2026 im glad you asked! So with January the pattern was different. Now mind you January was a completely different time in the markets as they had \u201cno idea\u201d what was to come and this was the first inflation shit the bed news, etc. etc. \n\nSo with January we saw the spike at 2pm followed by a small sell off. The 215pm candle then just held within the 2pm candle which is key to watch for. We then saw that 230pm (when JPOW starts presser) was the peak and from there we basically started dumping. This will be key to watch for. If we aren\u2019t seeing the Up -&gt; down -&gt; bigger up pattern started and come 230/235 we aren\u2019t seeing the pattern making a bottom we need to be prepared to play a put instead. From 230 to 245 we dumped lower and then that 245 candle dumped us all the way until 245. Keep and eye on the candle bodies. If the candle bodies are looking weak and we aren\u2019t seeing big wicks to the downside then we might get the dump like this. \n\nWhat could cause a dump like this? Well it depends what we see from the media this week and Monday/ Tuesday. The fed now is basically telling us we are getting 75bps hike and nothing matters. They said that 100bps hike wont help and doesn\u2019t matter. We are essentially expecting a 75bps hike so if we get surprised with a 100bps hike AND JPOW throws some sort of wild card at us we might see a dump like this. \n\nThe other wildcard which some are saying \u201chow can you be so bearish for FOMC\u2026 the markets already expects rates, etc. etc. etc.\u201d To this I do agree and this is where I say despite things being priced in\u2026 they are only priced in until the markets/ algos hear and see those numbers live. They its officially priced in. \n\nSomeone else and other I am hearing mention that the fed may actually hint to a pausing of rate hikes from here on out and maybe even at Wednesday meeting\u2026 why? Because big tech is already doing hiring freezes and the big techs are already showing that stuff is easing\u2026 it doesn\u2019t 100% make sense to me but I do see some peoples logic with it. \n\nSo if we are under the impression we are priced in then we need to be prepared that at 2pm till EOD we just rip on FOMC giving us \u201cgood\u201d news\u2026 aka not badder than expected news\u2026\n\nFor this type of \u201cgood news FOMC\u201d we gotta go back to December 15th and November 3rd 2021. \n\nIf we are expecting bull run during FOMC we will look for a large 2pm to 230pm pop\u2026 large then the normal 0.5% fake pop\u2026 but the KEY would be that we see a small retracement leading to 230 presser starting but we do NOT break below the 2pm candles low. If this is what we are getting that magical 235pm time is still the best buy time. \n\nIt is key to watch how the candles move and interact with eachother\u2026 and either way you HAVE to be patient\u2026 235pm regardless seems to be the magical buy time\u2026 and almost all scenarios 235pm is the CALL buy opportunity\u2026 only 1 meeting in the last 8 meetings was it an actual put buying opportunity.",

    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here, please be kind (especially the AutoMod) to me. You're welcome to discuss from your own viewpoint so that I can broaden my own viewpoint as well. Sometimes I may express investment misconception and you can of course point this out too.\n\nI adopted Value Investing as my method of making money a few years ago, buying cheap good stocks at bargain price. \"Good\" means a company with at least a thin moat (and well known) while generate satisfactory earning growth and having a healthy balance sheet,\n\nNow, as I tried to find those stocks I ended up almost nothing on my shopping list. For example, I went to scan the Australian market for low P/E and low P/B stocks and occasionally some high dividend paying stocks. Those stocks that passed my filter are like cyclical commodities stocks with temporary high profits, another was a well known department store but with a history of exec misconduct and I left with nothing but the bunch of unknown small companies (yes, greater risk -&gt; greater return or nothing!) with swinging profit and some are highly leveraged. What a waste of time.\n\nI tried with other developed markets such as Germany, Netherlands, France, ... but the results are appearing in the same way as in Australia, the bunch of unknown small companies. The good companies are always have a high multiples like $ASML, $MSFT, $NVDA, $TSLA. Those with low multiples are either commodities related or companies with shrinking earning forecast.\n\nAt this point, I start to believe that everything are priced in and the market is efficient in itself. Thinking about stocks as limited resources while there are new investors every year coming to find good stocks (and hold on for dear life) like me, and of course many of them are much advanced than myself and how in the hell am I going to compete with them to find such a good stock as most or all are taken. Shall I concluded that Value Investing are not working anymore? I don't even scanning the US market as I think there's always someone who monitor undervalued stocks using advance programming and take that opportunity instantly.\n\nWhat's your take?",

Porat said the strength of the dollar will hit next quarter\u2019s results even harder.\n\nPorat also characterized the current outlook as one of \u201cuncertainty in the global economic environment.\u201d\n\nAdvertising revenue increased just 12% to $56.3 billion, as marketers reeled in their spending to manage inflationary pressures. The most notable deceleration was in the YouTube division, where sales rose 5% after jumping 84% in the same period a year ago.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html)\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software maker issued a rosy income forecast for the year ahead, despite issuing quarterly results that failed to reach Wall Street consensus.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did:\n\n**Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**\n\n**Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**\n\nMicrosoft turned in the slowest revenue growth since 2020, at 12% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. The company\u2019s earnings per share fell short of consensus for the first time since 2016, with net income rising 2% to $16.74 billion.\n\nWith respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $49.25 billion to $50.25 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue. The middle of the range, at $49.75 billion, implies about 10% revenue growth, reflecting worsening PC sales and slower cloud infrastructure growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected more, at $51.49 billion. The company\u2019s implied gross margin, at 69.85%, was wider than the 69.30% consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.\n\nAnd for the new 2023 fiscal year, the company reiterated its forecast from three months ago, despite the economic climate.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html)\n\nJim Cramer tweeted \"I think Google and Microsoft will be good tomorrow\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m08gk1crl3e91.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b8f3c1131077652c463086f8a6abd05e467d7cd\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are both up 3% on pre market trading despite reporting yesterday earnings that missed estimates.

Their operating costs will continue to shoot up, and Net Profit for this quarter will come in at approx -$160M. This is supposed to be a growth company, but their revenues and bookings are largely flat q/q and y/y. \n\nMSFT's XBOX, Sony, and Nintendo, and Activision all posted weaker than expected earnings, the gaming sector as a whole has not had a great earnings season and I expect RBLX to be no different. \n\nAs consumer savings go down and we enter a recession, parents will give their children less money to spend on virtual goods and games, as consumer discretionary goods tend to be the first to go in these environments.\n\nAs well, their attempts to expand into markets like India and China will be extremely costly, they will need to ramp up hiring, specifically on General and Administrative, Sales and Marketing, and their largest expense in Content Moderation. \n\nAs well, the strength of the dollar will reduce the value of their bookings and revenues by approx 5% this quarter, data for May showed a 4% headwind from FX and the dollar has only strengthened since then.\n\n(Disclosure, I have position in RBLX consisting of 90% short shares and 10% puts)",

He's a fraud, whose been able to get away with it because he figured out equity financing is always better than debt financing. What a fucking genius. If you rely on equity financing you don't have any real liabilities. You just need to convince people you're fucking reputable.

Man, chill, that's the 1% carrying our relatively average country. **American Exceptionalism, \"but that's another topic\" - drake. You think you're really something special? Only a few really do anything imaginative.**  I'm tryna tell you guys, we're built on a house of cards. Most money is allocated in the aforementioned companies( 401k's passive investing) ...The USDhas been rising when only about 40% of the big companies receive their revenue in foreign currency, before needing to exchange to strong USD (NEGATIVE BTW) . **Negative because our revenue and bottom line is negatively impacted by foreign exchange impact (you'll hear this a lot moving forward in earnings calls when google, msft miss).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I've been thinking about this for awhile, done the fucking numbers and will go out on a limb now that we're in this short squeeze rally. Google, MSFT, AMZN, CMG, KO, AND (POSSIBLY) APPLE, WILL NEVER GENERATE THE FCF, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS, etc. -- PER SHARE, THAT WE EXPECT. They will trade like BUD, MO, T. VZ, BA, etc in the future. Looks like a general market squeeze going on right now because the shoe shine boy is hollering dooom and gloom, but soon, he'll sing song of good times when the market goes green as it has. That is the time, from now to about 13.8k on Nasdaq, 430 on SPY, when the squeeze has squoze and you'll see. You'll see the chicken come home to roost. All the liquidity be sucked up, fed fund at 125 bps higher than today, and maturities of bonds without reinvestment**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **You'll see, and it'll probably be after you do anything about it.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wish you all the best, but only a few end up with the bread in the end.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: DCA'ing debit put spreads biweekly in AMZN, TSLA, GOOG, SPY, TQQQ, 60-180 days exp.",

Everyone has been killed, from retailers, retards like you, VCs, the Soft Banks, the Chamaths, the bond traders, Cathie Woods, etc...\n\nThe rational thinking killed everyone in the market. The only thing you have now left is to behave irrationally. Like when we all speculated with SPACs in the initial phase, with GMEs, AMCs and shut the mouth of all the red-flaggers in the media calling Reddit and retailers \"dangerous and ignorants\".\n\nYou already have your rational and valuation-based portfolio. You can still buy MSFT or GOOGL and will be able to buy tomorrow. But the BBBY trade is a once in your life chance given the very rare circumstances: Like it happened with GME, you all now have a strong storytelling (watermelons, Anti-Cramer, unity...) and this is time to say FUCK you FED and your inflation fight. We already suffered an erosion in our power bargain, we didn't decide to get involved in a war in the east of Europe but the entire world will pay the consequences, etc... The real world will be always here to FUCK YOU. Now it's time to dream in the parallel universe where we create our own REALITY.\n\nCNBC Says \"Oh my god, BBBY is now valued at 2Bn$\": We say, what the fuck \"value\" means?

PLEASE! cut your losses, reinvest in something smart...\n\nNever Yolo everything...\n\nI have to be honest with you, I entered under 10, hoped for 35-40 in momentum, didn't quit until today at 12  USD.\n\nI was bullish as shit, but not for long term, BBBY is not MSFT... come on, be real with yourselves.\n\nI made a comment few days ago that is sitting at -9 points\n\n\"Realistically? This hype train will die out in 6 weeks, and then limbo, see AMC and GME, squeeze was squozen, thinking that GME will moon, at this point makes no sense. I don't think it was squozen for BBBY yet. I can see huge gains this week, with the hype train, I'm happy to see spike to 35 and get out in part, maybe 50 if we really fuck up the algorithms, as much fun as it is to see the candles, even DFV reduced his position. Cash is cash, buy SPY and Nasdaq til EOY, gamble with some, but not all your money.\n\nEOY 50 USD is possible, but speculative as fuck!\n\nSurely, I don't think we will see single digit price in this stock for a very long time, same with GME and AMC, gorrila is out the cage.\n\nDD with my finest crayon's:\n\nAt the moment we are at 13 usd, valued 1 billion. With 35usd per share, company valuation will be approx 3,2 billion dollars.... As it stands GME and AMC were squeezed to, at this moment, 12 billion in evaluation, and BBBY is just about 1 billion now, see my fucktard way of thinking? I also refuse to believe that shorts learned their lesson, better yet, they're likely bullish to ride that wave for a week or two, and then they'll exit, which will cause some massive drops.\n\nMy valuation math is probably fucked, it's Saturday, so I ain't sober and I'm not doing maths for you, someone will comment below, correcting me.\n\nSo yes, I can believe that AMC and GME crowd will jump on the bandwagon and will push the valuation this high, purely out of the mechanism of the market, and to have another GME moment.\n\nPurely momentum, I can see 35 EUR spike this week, and Friday with bunch of options expiring will be fun, for sure.\n\nMind you, week ago Monday bbby shot up 60% in a single day. This play was still relatively under the radar for most, this has changed last week, when everyone noticed the spike and started paying attention. Loads of calls were executed this Friday for strike price 10 - 10,50 Seeing the posts here, there's a number of options that will expire on the 19th, for the same strike price.\"",

    "selftext": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-video-cuts-earnings-and-revenue-outlook-for-the-year-stock-falls-11661199597?mod=mw_latestnews\n\nZoom Video Communications Inc. is struggling to convince people to pay for its videoconferencing service in the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a trimmed forecast and falling stock price Monday.\n\nZoom ZM, -2.07% executives reduced their earnings and revenue guidance for the fiscal year Monday afternoon, and Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg blamed a stronger U.S. dollar \u2014 a problem many global tech companies have called out in recent earnings reports \u2014 but also a decline in \u201cthe online business,\u201d or the more casual Zoom user.\n\n\u201cOur revenue was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, performance of the online business, and to a lesser extent sales weighted to the back end of the quarter,\u201d Steckelberg said in a statement included with the results.\n\nIn an interview with MarketWatch and a conference call Monday afternoon, Steckelberg acknowledged that individuals and small businesses have changed their habits. Many aren\u2019t flocking to the service as often or for as long as they did during the peak of the pandemic, when many Americans were working almost exclusively from home and socializing with friends over the service. An increase in one-on-one meetups, vacations and hybrid work schedules have altered the post-pandemic business cycle for Zoom, executives acknowledge, and getting users to pay is harder.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge is new customer additions,\u201d she said.\n\nZoom recently installed a 40-minute limit on users with a Basic, or free, subscription, which Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi said could be a way to push more users to become paying subscribers. Steckelberg told MarketWatch that the time cap has had a \u201csignificantly positive impact\u201d so far, but admitted in the conference call it was \u201cnot enough to overcome the macro dynamics.\u201d\n\nThe news wasn\u2019t all bad \u2014 Zoom\u2019s enterprise business, which sells subscriptions to larger organizations, grew 27% to $599 million. Enterprise customers improved 18% to 204,100 over the past year through contracts with UCLA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -7.43% and others, as well as longer deals. Zoom Phone licenses hit a record of nearly 4 million, up more than 100% year-over-year.\n\n\u201cIt was a mixed quarter, with enterprise proving to be strong,\u201d Steckelberg told MarketWatch.\n\nThe ongoing friction between employees who wish to continue to work from home and employers like Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.30%, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -2.53% GOOG, -2.58% Google and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META, -2.92% \u2014 all of whom are sitting on acres of unused commercial real estate and asking workers to come in at least twice a week \u2014 could have a profound impact on Zoom. A group of Apple employees on Monday launched a petition asking CEO Tim Cook for a more flexible work policy.\n\nThe company also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.94%, Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -2.03%, Google and many other corners.\n\nM Science\u2019s software analyst Charles Rogers believes users aren\u2019t jumping to other platforms, but cutting the service because of inflation and more relaxed pandemic guidelines. He also saw more worrisome results internationally than in the U.S., with a second consecutive quarterly decline in the European region and sequentially flat sales in the Asia Pacific quadrant.\n\nRead more: Zoom faces a threat from Microsoft Teams, but how great is the risk?\n\nZoom posted fiscal second-quarter net income of $45.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion, up from $1.02 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, Zoom reported earnings of $1.05 a share, down from $1.36 a share last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 94 cents a share on revenue of $1.12 billion.\n\nZoom executives said they now expect full-year adjusted earnings of $3.66 to $3.69 a share on revenue of roughly $4.39 billion, down from $3.70 to $3.77 a share on sales of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion. For the third quarter, they expect 82 to 83 cents a share on revenue of about $1.1 billion, while analysts on average had been projecting 92 cents a share on sales of $1.15 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nZoom shares declined nearly 9% in after-hours trading following release of the results, after closing with a 2.1% decline at $97.44. Zoom\u2019s stock is down 47% so far in 2022. The broader S&amp;P 500 index  SPX, -2.14%  has slid 13% this year.",

TSLA was **THE MOST** heavily shorted stock in the world in mid 2020. How do you think it's so fucking high in value and went ballistic and 10x in less than 1 year? Now its gone literally nowhere for almost 2 years. The shorts getting fucked hard had a LOT to do with TSLA epic 2020 run. Cherry picking here, from Jan '21 to now, TSLA is about even, maybe slightly down -2%. 600 days later, a shit ton of sales and growth, new models, new factories, etc and other good shit, and its gone nowhere because people learned to fear shorting TSLA.\n\n**-** **Gamestop** **(GME)** ***(Estimations of short losses of $20 billion)*** needs no introduction but it was $4 pre-split and in pre-split terms went to $400+ and still sitting at pre-split $120 and about pre-split $200 a month ago. You're telling me GME went from $4 to $120-$200 range because RC is turning it around with NFTs no one gives a fuck about anytime soon? What's his play, sell video games online? Platforms already do that. Or let me guess, going to offer everyone 1 penny for their trade-ins instead of 2 pennies? LMFAO...What moat does GME have that any Megacap like GOOG, META, AMZN, MSFT, etc etc can't copy or do better? Fuck it, Netflix probably has more customers and a better chance selling NFTs than GME LMFAO. Even dare I say Robinhood could probably do it better.\n\n**Shit does not need to make sense nor be rational.** If your argument against BBBY going to $30, $50, $100, or $500 is the \"value\" of BBBY isn't worth that much and that is an irrational price target, then you are completely mistaken and don't understand how the market works. BBBY could become the world's most valuable company this week if there were enough shorts getting their nuts squeezed off. Of course, this is completely irrational and beyond unrealistic but you get my point.\n\nNow I know everyone is expecting some epic news release tomorrow and the price to rip to $30 but that isn't going to happen. Stop being dumb and unrealistic. Strategic news is not some magical saving grace and automatic doubling of revenue everyone dreams about. The news will 100% give the shorts a reason to attack the fuck out of the stock and since everyone is impatient and a little paper-handed bitch, BBBY WILL drop like a MOFO tomorrow. Stop being little bitches and hold your panties up with those diamond hands. Don't drop 'em for the hedgies. **Stop Losses are for losers!**\n\nShills, let's see you change my mind...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Stocks have been squeezed crazy high for ages.

    "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)\n\nI'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:\n\n1. Earnings\n2. Major Economic Events\n3. My Watchlist\n4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\n**Earnings this week that I will play**\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow i play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don\u2019t  go over 5% size on any earning\u2019s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - GitLabs - $GTLB\n\n* DevOps software company\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) &amp; Revenue $94m\n* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently\n* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings\n* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.\n* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)\n* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish\n\n**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - NIO inc - $NIO:\n\n* EV car manufacturer\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST\n* Estimate eps ($0.17) &amp; revenue $1.45b\n* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.\n* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings\n* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY\n* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting\n* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one\n\nAfter Close - Gamestop - $GME\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) &amp; Revenue $1.27B\n* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.\n* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings\n* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY\n* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss\n\n**Thursday 8 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - Docusign - $DOCU\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m\n* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings\n* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week\n* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here\n\n**Friday 9 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - Kroger - $KR\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 &amp; Revenue $602m\n* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings\n* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only\n\n**Major Economic events this week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2\n\nSo  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug\n\nWednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July\n\n12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech\n\nThursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech\n\nFriday\n\n10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories\n\n12:30 - Fed Walker Speech\n\nAs  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.\n\nMarket  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!",

    "title": "Why I believe DOCU will tank following earnings this week all the way into 2023",
    "selftext": "Elevator pitch:\n\nDOCU is one of the Covid stocks that has already fallen alot (75% YTD) but it still sports a P/S of 5 on a negative GAAP operating margin and EPS. This segment has very low barrier of entry and cost of changing to a competitor. There are very strong (potential) competitors that can leverage huge platform effects (MSFT, AAPL, ADBE etc.). Currently DOCU has very attractive gross margins which likely will be eroded by competition. If they cannot be GAAP positive now, it will only get worse.\n\nGrowth is slowing substantially, so far the CAGR and YoY growth numbers look quite but soon will deteriorate based on recent quarters. If the growth trajectory has slowed further in Q2 which is likely, the stock will drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Growth:**\n\nTop line growth has almost halted over the last months, down to only $8m in Q1 FY23. Moreover, Billings which take into account contract liabilities have declined in Q3 FY22 and Q1 FY23 already.\n\n[The bar chart on the right is not to scale. Source: Docusign investor relation presentation](https://preview.redd.it/1mav8mi0ucm91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f26c83d624e98262ceaa35bc555ea41ec200c1a)\n\nCustomer Growth has decelerated substantially, only growing 6% in Q1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Docusign investor relation presentation](https://preview.redd.it/3mw0l3ksucm91.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7893ffda3a8920b7f796f8809cfe4f06d2c26c99)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Profitability**\n\nDOCU sports very high non-GAAP Gross Margins of &gt;80%. While this is an impressive number, it is not surprising as it sells a pure non-customized SAAS solution. Currently DOCU benefits from a very advantageous marketing approach where it charges customers on a per-signature model. A key risk is that competitors may offer a flatrate model which would offer six or seven figure savings to large MNC customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jwsgj1ovcm91.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dda1929caa241f2a79346796de2978f29522769\n\nDOCU is FCF positive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kq8ilq1wcm91.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c82b314909d08ca2f54b773d8dbb8ccecc3b364e\n\nHowever the core issue is stock based compensation and other cost that Management excludes in Non-GAAP results. overall, this results in negative GAAP operating margins\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dj6up53jwcm91.png?width=1447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589881588f3a06a91b28126b850b1c6d574ad74e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion DOCU currently is investing heavily in growth on a steeply diminishing returns basis. It seems that customer acquisition cost are increasing rapidly and Sales is consuming most of the FCF generated by the business\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stock based compensation (SBC)**\n\nin 2021 DOCU paid its employees ca. 245m SBC while this has increased to 350m in FY 2022. In Q1 FY23, SBC has increased to 95m which results in a minimum of 380m if Headcount &amp; compensation stays flat. However, HC has increased 25% over FY 22 so it can be expected that growth will continue and thus SBC.\n\nSBC is a helpful tool to manage cash burn for a growth company with expanding market capitalization and rising stock price. However, on declining market cap it poses additional dilutive downward pressure on stock price.\n\nExample:\n\nAt the current market cap of ca. 10bn, an annualized SBC of 500m will represent a dilution of 5%. The same SBC would have only meant a 1% dilution one year ago when the market cap was circa 50bn. Should the stock decline further towards 5bn, SBC will dilute by 10%.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhile DOCU is as fundamentally profitable (non-GAAP) venture without debt and a robust balance sheet. Currently it is the leader in this field, however the hurdles of entry are low and competitors like MSFT could offer the product as part of their existing platform (MS Office) which would make DOCU obsolete for many customers.\n\nFurther, it seems the current pricing model where customers pay per signature seems very advantageous for DOCU as the marginal cost of each signature tends to be zero. However, it can be expected that competitors will offer flatrate models (as is customary with more mature SAAS solutions) which will put high margin pressure on DOCU.\n\nTherefor I rate this a sell. I will open a short position today as I expect this stock to trend towards a 5bn valuation which would put it at a 10 FY22 FCF multiple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**:\n\nThe company is not fundamentally flawed and could convert into a profitable business if Sales and SBC cost are managed.\n\nThe company is still relatively small with 2bn revenue and may be able to recover its growth trajectory.\n\nIf growth stocks experience another rally, DOCU will certainly be one of the potential winners.",

    "selftext": "While meme stocks are often associated with risky investments, there are a few with strong fundamentals that investors might want to buy to cash in on the craze.\n\nNokia (NOK): Nokia has transformed dramatically, re-emerging as a major player in the telecom industry.\n\nWhen looking for the best meme stocks to buy, it is important to shield yourself against volatility. The best way to do so is through investing in meme stocks with strong fundamentals. For example, you want to look for stocks with a history of growing earnings, a strong balance sheet and a proven business model. Additionally, consider buying stocks that trade at low valuations to protect yourself against this inherent volatility.\n\nFor many investors, meme stocks and solid fundamentals do not go hand in hand. Companies such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) are best known for being volatile, and investors often feel they can\u2019t be relied on to provide stability.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that any particular meme stock will be successful, investors should carefully research any stock before buying it. Not only do these three companies have strong business models, but they are also operating in high-growth industries. This fundamental strength gives them a distinct advantage over other companies that do not have such a safety net.\n\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) was once the undisputed king of the mobile phone market. However, its dominance began to unravel in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone. It was slow to embrace touch screens and failed to capitalize on the popularity of app stores. As a result, its once-loyal customer base began to desert Nokia in droves. \n\nThe company desperately attempted to regain market share by adopting Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system, but it was too late. By 2013, Nokia\u2019s phones were no longer selling in significant numbers, and the company was forced to sell its handset business to Microsoft.\n\nHowever, Nokia has been focusing on 5G for the last five years, and it looks to be in a prime position to continue succeeding in this new area. \n\nThe company has been investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) for 5G technology, and its products have been well-received by customers. Nokia is also one of the few companies with a complete end-to-end 5G solution, which gives it a significant advantage over its competitors.\n\nNokia has stitched together seven consecutive earning beats, demonstrating the company\u2019s superior fundamentals. It is also a well-rounded company with a diversified product portfolio and a strong presence in emerging and developed markets.\n\nFurthermore, Nokia has a strong balance sheet with plenty of dry powder to invest in growth initiatives. In sum, Nokia is a high-quality company with a bright future, which is why Nokia is among the best meme stocks to buy.",

The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;**\\[12:10 ET\\]**  Japan intervenes in the FX market to support the yen - Nikkei.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\\[11:56 ET\\]**  Fed's Daly: We will do a step-down, not to pause, but to 50 or 25 BPS increments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\\[11:48 ET\\]**  Fed's Daly: According to projections, policy will be tightened to 4.5%-5% next year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\\[08:52 ET\\]**  Fed set to raise rates by 0.75 point and debate the size of future hikes - WSJ.\u00a0\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ko57t91jdv91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b50a1caca38ecaa66ed3d0d2ad7515a1775adb1\n\n# Earnings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dar0im4jdv91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755ac7086cefaa29f543c207b0928c7b77164296\n\n# \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA\n\nFib.

    "title": "10-24-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA",
    "selftext": "Well it looks like I was able to pick the right direction this week. So far my thesis of a bullish pre-FOMC week followed by a bullish FOMC week. MSFT presents earnings tomorrow after hours and that will be the catalyst for the week in my opinion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gs6bmuqnctv91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e1fdb4f047349f9d7352311a9a04458f2d3c2ff\n\nToday was actually a really bullish day for SPY. We not only closed over KEY resistance of 378.2 for the first time in over a month but we also broke through and closed over the blue bear channel resistance line. This is the resistance line that Apple broke through last week. In addition we now have a full candle closed over the daily 20 and daily 8ema for the first time since beginning of September. \n\nNow that we have broken into the next channel level and have broke out of the grey channel. We will look for that 378.2 support of the channel to be reconfirmed tomorrow. This could be a bear rally that gets rejected hard and results in a pretty big sell off back to the 350s-360s but as of now I have no reason to bet against SPY or the general market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86xq0h7octv91.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7e9e676be66c65608704230d60361bb1ca977a1\n\nSomething interesting today is that we actually saw the S&amp;P500 hold as the most bullish index today. Tech and NYSE both lagged today. Which is a big change because in the previous weeks NYSE was leading the charge. We may be seeing a rotation here again. \n\nKey support- 378.2 -&gt; 374.4 -&gt; 370.6\n\nKey resistance- 382.2 -&gt; 386.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bd3r1poctv91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db55e9b1b9c831753cdac93f2bdd0e10b4cfddf9\n\nFutures looks really great too and was able to do the same thing today breaking through that key 3805 resistance level. We do need to see afterhours close over that level without a major dump here in the next hour. But overall this is pretty bullish. Bulls will look to take out the 50ema resistance tomorrow/ overnight. \n\nIn addition you can see the new red bull channel that has formed. Bullish until we see that channel broken. \n\nKey support \u2013 3805 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3710 -&gt; 3675\n\nKey resistance- 3875 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rcim7o5pctv91.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52cfc3d53267c8e06853ab7c01e85309247fdf31\n\nApple has a really impressive V bottom formed. I really believe apple is leading its charge and possibly this week will look to re-take that daily 200ema resistance and retake key level of 154.5. With a good earnings report this week I can easily see this being accomplished. \n\nAs with spy and futures bullish until the red bull channel support is broken.\n\nKey support- 147.4 -&gt; 145.4 -&gt; 142.8\n\nKey resistance- 150.7 -&gt; 152.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo4x1skpctv91.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d5a9c8f4b637fd6637103d88206b7532f972b1\n\nTesla impressively in my opinion has found its bottom. After pretty much a week plus of Tesla attempting to break out and getting beat down making three 52 week lows in the last week I believe we are seeing support being put in and Tesla is establishing 205.8 as support right now. I remain bullish until we see a break through and more importantly a close below 205.8 support and close below 204.6 weekly support I remain bullish. \n\nTesla is forming or had formed a diamond pattern and does appear to have broken through the diamond pattern resistance and broken through the black bear channel resistance from the peak of the September sell off. \n\nKey support- 205.8 -&gt; 196\n\nKey resistance- 215.1 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 233.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxpnt5zrctv91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04ef370d316a6175cee61ff16dbe9ba07d8081cb\n\nAgain I don\u2019t even wanna include the VIX in my TA anymore since it couldn\u2019t be more disconnected form the market but it is worth including I suppose. So far the VIX is continuing to hold near 30 and is holding its bull channel. If and when that fails is when I do expect the next leg up on SPY. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall a really great week so far. It was brought to my attention today that I have not had a red day since October 7th. Before that the last red day was September 1st. I have not had a red week since the week of August 29th to September 2nd. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bit8fifsctv91.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd478f02c73223d45155a9e6068fab19c612e1bd\n\nBelow you can see the LEVEL to LEVEL trades from last Friday and how well they played out today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avq3u31tctv91.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=201db39a2f83aac4ab4c726bd915a7f227a92324\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qm5ll0jtctv91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9c1e96ca9a6b86d69df8029c6f5eee37e04d78\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2culd8uctv91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed231e3c9541c187da8f0daf5f8bb86e8120dc7",

    "title": "MVIS - Lasers are the future and the future is NOW!!",
    "selftext": "Early birds catch the juiciest worms!\n\nIts Monday cocksuckers.. And lady cocksuckers. And boy do I have a spicy one for you today...   Lasers BITCH!\n \nApril 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB and all the hype of a potential MSFT buyout, we all know how that went, but fuck you that's not the point. Fast forward 18 months and it\u2019s clear that the price action in April 2021 was just an amuse bouch\u00e9e for what will happen next.\n\nDevelopments since April 2021 include:\nMavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It\u2019s getting worse by the week as daily we are seeing trading largely Algo driven as with a lot of the market, liquidity is drying up and shorts are passing blocks between themselves to drive the price down. Some wrinkle brains with actual knowledge of how the market works have counts in the range of 100million shares short total on MVIS, a big difference from the 24% currently reported. Average short volume for the past 30 days is a whopping 70.36% with off exchange volume for the past 30 days touching 34.08%. Given many stocks are highly shorted right now I don't want to hear any slabbering, I know this shit man, but with a product as delicious as MAVIN Dr just being trademarked, and the fact they provided the light engine which made the Hololens 2 possible, and lets face it, if MSFT are using MVIS for the Hololens 2 they sure as hell are using it for the IVAS which secured MSFT that ball tingling $22bili contract with the US military. This is a ticking time bomb ready to fuck any short brave enough to touch it. Hiya Kenny.\n \nMVIS have a cash runway for 2 years. They have negligible debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. Which given the state of the world right now is a golden arrow in their quiver, many of these competitors aren't likely to make it to production without seriously diluting their shareholders... I'm looking at you Omer(INVZ CEO for those unaware) who on the 29th of September announced Mixed shelf registration for up to $200million... CEO claims they don't need it but have done so for \"good business practices\".... Check his twitter comments stating such. I call bullshit, enough said.\n\nMVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. \nMVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an \u201cOEM friendly\u201d white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor. Which the company has filed trademark registration for on 10/11/2022 https://uspto.report/TM/97628161 notice the smaller form factor compared to the original postings on linkedIn \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/microvision_autosens-automotivelidar-activity-6975685318729490432-Hy3B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\n\nNow the company has stated the form factor will get smaller when ASIC is completed... Is this the final smaller form or will we see another size decrease... We can only speculate for now..\n\nMavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. This has been tested and demonstrated to Some OEM (it hasn't been declared who) in Germany where the company has Offices set up as of last year... Someone wants MVIS in Germany...\n\nMavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. \n\nMavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.\n\nMavin is available to OEMs via the NVDA platform.\nMVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&amp;A. Feeling like Pac-Man munching up these dots.. Nom, Nom, Nom. \n\nMVIS currently has 3 vacancies for ASIC design engineers https://www.microvision.com/current-opportunities/\nTo which the CEO Sumit Sharma stated last year that it is not cost effective to design an ASIC unless they have secured orders for 1.2-1.5 million units... What does that tell you???\n\nSumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! Listen. Some clampets out there are stating that such a certification is capable of being self-certed.. to which I respond... Why the delay then bitch??? Because just like everything in this shitshow of a world since Covid, THERE ARE DELAYS.\n\nMVIS said in the Jan 2022 investor slides that they would be ready for partnerships this year. Now that Class 1 certification has been achieved, MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! To which Sample sales have already started and are being shipped off to the big knobs with fat ass check books as we speak...\n\nSingle Unit - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/3.jpg\n5 Unit case - https://uspto.report/TM/97628161/APP20221014103328/4.jpg\nTalk about classy..\n\nMVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July\u2019s earnings call. Now they have the class 1 certification, those orders have been shipped. They quoted one OEM as saying \u201cMavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen\u201d. Sumit\u2019s character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. Now, when I say Sumit is a humble man I certainly believe that to be the case, he is an engineer, so he gets rightfully excited when talking about the product and what the company has achieved with such, and in my opinion has no need to be a boisterous character like we see in some of the competitors, *cough* Austin Russell *cough* which tells me a lot about the company and the product they are offering...\n \nThe MVIS executive bonus scheme was launched this summer and it rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36. Todays opening price was $3.49. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! The tiered executive bonus scheme is organised as such that management doesn't get awarded shares unless the share price reaches the thresholds and stays there for 20 days. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP. This is the real deal, and will make you enough money to finally move your way up from sleeping at the bottom of your wife and her many boyfriends bed.   \n\nTheir investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market. \n\nThey have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  \n\nIn January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That\u2019s a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple deals are expected to be signed over the next 9-10 months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. \n\nIn addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which as previously mentioned only exists because of MVIS tech! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/OmiQvjQuFqQ\n\nDone so by a very fine Redditor who took it upon himself after countless hours or research following patents etc to prove once and for all that MVIS are the dogs balls and have the tech so well patented and perfected that the biggest, baddest tech companies in the world cannot make this tech as good as this for themselves. Hiya Meta and APPL. Now MSFT had MVIS by the balls when this deal was struck as the company could well have been facing bankruptcy if it wasn't for the savage group of investors who put so much into this company, they staved off the relentless shorting and helped bring about the savage short squeeze we seen in April 2021.... This company has made so many people life changing amounts of money... But guess what, they ain't fucking done yet. People still buying shares when its right for them as they know the life changing money they have already made will be made again...   \n\nMany AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. \nThen factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, and no one is selling. We all know what we own. \nIt\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price.  There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  it\u2019s inevitable.\n\nOh yeah EC is this Thursday.. Not expecting any mind blowing or even significant revenue changes, anyone expecting such will be sorely disappointed, but that is not the point. The business updates and hearing the confidence in managements statements is enough to get you harder than a couple little blue boys and your Mrs standing with a big red dildo to fuck you harder than the market has this year.\n\nListen, I could post DD for days on this company but you degenerate fucks are probably only going to read the TLDR and tell me to \"short squeeze these nuts\" (Fuck you Automod) buy shares, LEAPs if you must, but do not play into the MMs hand by buying weeklies or I'm going to come fuck you myself.\n\nTLDR; this is in my opinion the most highly researched company on the market, the DD is phenomenal, and the company has the meat to follow. They cannot make a move without retail hot on their tail... And management KNOW THIS... Fuck the shorts, lasers are the future and MVIS knows lasers better than anyone.  PEW PEW\n\nP.s THIS IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY, although, the fact it is so highly shorted is just some extra fuel for when a deal is announced i'm telling you now so you have a chance to get in not far off what has so far been the bottom... What happens between now and a deal being announced is anyone's guess, but this is a damn good place to join the roller-coaster.  \n\nPositions \nhttps://imgur.com/Z2dvqdS\nAnd a Spreadbet account that makes Bill Hwang look like a genius",

    "selftext": " \n\nWall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market\u2019s most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy\u2019s health.\n\nOn the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) \u2013 which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index \u2013 will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.\n\nA bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.\n\n \n\nEarnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.\n\nFor this quarter, the number of S&amp;P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.\n\nEarnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn\u2019t leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla\u2019s revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nOn Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.\n\nStrength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback\u2019s 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.\n\nThat headwind is expected to show up in Amazon\u2019s results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate\u2019s revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that \u201cforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs\" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.\n\n  \n\nFor Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted \u201cdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.\u201d\n\nMeta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech\u2019s 72-hour earnings rollout.\n\nOther notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.\n\nIn economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings \u2013 which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER\u2019s panel of economists must officially declare a recession.\n\nEconomic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.\n\n \n\nAccording to Pantheon Economics\u2019 Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.\n\n\u201cBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,\u201d Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.",

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.",

    "selftext": "Today SPY continued its green move up and was able to officially hold support of that 378.2 channel and close its first full candle back there since beginning of September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hfwyaia851w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c041f96144f137f8254090161a465ab7bd1a1a\n\nThe issue we have now is that MSFT and Google earnings apparently did not go very well and that is causing a pretty significant red after hours. As I am writing this SPY is down about -0.9%. \n\nWe were able today to push pretty green and we broke through the last resistance of the bear channel level from the August sell off. That is pretty bullish. With this earnings miss we could look for a healthy pull back to reconfirm support after a pretty large 3 day green move up. Or this could end up being the next peak of the bear market rally and we start our descent downward to the 350s/ 360s. For me until we break that red bull channel support I will remain bullish. I will also be watching closely for what we do at that 378.2 support level. Tomorrow could actually have a really impressive red day and still maintain the red bull channel. \n\nKey support- 382.3 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 378.1 -&gt; 374.4\n\nKey resistance- 385.2 -&gt; 388.7 -&gt; 390.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/42603gq851w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a07ffe7115c4984c8fd2c27f1281c15660ae827\n\nLooks like futures was able to cover no mans land as I called it yesterday which ranged from 3805 to 3875. However, now this daily candle is opened below that level and we will look to see what happens next. Daily 50ema support lies at 3828 for overnight and tomorrow. 3925 remains the bear channel resistance that dates back to the August top. \n\nKey support- 3805 -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3705\n\nKey resistance- 3870 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/438lbv7951w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14788465482445b65fd93f897e9dc6d3b4fb27b6\n\nApple continues to look quite stout and strong despite the rest of the Market. Apple was able to make a move all the way up to its 100ema today falling just short of closing above it. The 100ema and 200ema now lie well within range of being retaken. Apple taking the 100/200ema would be exetremly bullish not only technical but sentiment wise. \n\nKey support- 150 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.3\n\nKey resistance- 152.3 -&gt; 154.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dq8umso951w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=608f96827612a8f1a564a641959736b04fa84ba0\n\nI dare say I was impressed with tesla today! It perfectly hit my first target of 223 (unfortunately I closed my calls way too early). However, today we saw tesla once again hold support and actually had one of the most bullish days I have seen in a very long time. However, in the end it fell just short of 222.5 resistance. We have a nice diamond pattern formed here where you can see Tesla rejected on its upside move today. Tesla still could see a retracement but it is showing some signs of bullishness after it established 206 as support. \n\nTomorrow or later this week I will need to see Tesla break through that blue bear channel in order to believe in a bigger move up to 230s. If we continue to see the trend of sell off followed by a rogue green day that only brings further downside and we close back under 205 at any point I will be looking at puts. \n\nKey support- 215.1 -&gt; 210 -&gt; 205.7\n\nKey resistance- 22.4 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23fxxxdb51w91.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a53614ad5f6d0ab019259fc304a2c064f9cfcac6\n\nTerrible timing\u2026 but the VIX finally sold off. We finally broke the bull channel and we even retested that key 28.4 level, however, we ended up bouncing pretty hard off of it. With these earnings coming in and this hugely red after hours it will be interesting to see what the VIX does tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nOverall a great day that was heavily support by some level to level plays I made. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nn7qbawb51w91.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e596c065e1b6ed277e5a3aaea2f5f1a1463262\n\nGranted especially Tesla which went on to almost triple the profits from where I closed them I had some pretty stout wins this morning on my level to level wins. With earnings coming out tonight and being gone at the EOD I decided it was best to sit cash gang overnight. I will be looking to see where thing settle tomorrow by EOD and will look for some level to level plays there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9r0bkcc51w91.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71915c4433ab470da88ed2ef6c5ad5e7b59347e7\n\nI was able to play a few level to level plays intraday today for some smaller profits. I got greedy on them but didn\u2019t let them go red. I suspect tomorrow to be able to have a few of these level to level plays to play again. SPY lately really has been respecting key pivot support/ resistance levels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w92eqhsc51w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=942d5ec17036a5a508f5127c2c53b93274cb22c8",

That would represent 9.5% revenue growth year over year, which would be the slowest growth since 2017. In July, Microsoft\u2019s finance chief, Amy Hood, had told analysts to expect revenue growth to be 2% lower than it otherwise would be because of currency fluctuations.\n\nTechnology industry researcher Gartner said earlier this month that PC shipments in the quarter fell 19.5% year over year, and chipmaker AMD\n\nearlier this month issued lower-than-expected preliminary quarterly results tied to a \u201cweaker than expected PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.\u201d A slowing PC market could cause weakness in Microsoft\u2019s revenue from the Windows operating system.\n\nAnalysts expect Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud revenue to grow 36.4% on an annualized basis, compared with 40% growth in the previous quarter, according to a survey of 14 analysts conducted by CNBC.

    "title": "10-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis",
    "selftext": "Well today was one wild day that\u2019s for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. \n\nI have had a LOT of questions about what a \u201clevel to level\u201d play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad\n\nOkay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. \n\nThe way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren\u2019t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn\u2019t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. \n\nI played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. \n\nNow you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sriqbh5m68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48078874afaf12dd694dffb79a5b62516666b1d0\n\nKey support- 381.6 -&gt; 378.9 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 374.3\n\nKey resistance- 385 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 390.1\n\nI am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple\u2026. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8vo4ipm68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f5c2338cf936f05d3078fded0dc6a483c555d14\n\nSomething else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncrnug5n68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf95fba0118ebdf0005446324132cf850c708848\n\nHere is a little excerpt to kinda help explain it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bowchjn68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c39316cd1e6b2cdd678135245fa4cb5de0f3b7\n\nYou know those little maps that say \u201cyou are here\u201d when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. \n\nAs you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak\u2026 apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover\u2026 its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. \n\nKey support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3770\n\nKey resistance- 3875 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khdd3q1o68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=294783afc532d3880c7fbea998d610a3294c2acc\n\nThat rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn\u2019t very bullish\u2026 \n\nWith MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing\u2026 technically Tesla beat but missed revenue\u2026 its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before\u2026 But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don\u2019t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. \n\nKey support- 149.3 -&gt; 147.3 -&gt; 145.5\n\nKey resistance- 150.9 -&gt; 152.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a\n\nWho loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today\u2026 So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. \n\nOverall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. \n\nSomething I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. \n\nKey support- 219.3 -&gt; 214.4 -&gt; 209.9 -&gt; 205.6\n\nKey resistance- 225 -&gt; 229.5 -&gt; 234\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3t8eesp68w91.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9f254fdcf97f3a345399b90ad6a06737c32de66\n\nAs if the VIX couldn\u2019t become anymore detached from reality\u2026 we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? \n\nWell I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers\u2026 however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That\u2019s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nAs I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6pyzwbq68w91.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c34d32dfbab4ca5bd9d2f3bf31a37fb338518bd6\n\nI had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn\u2019t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it\u2019s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dkmofsq68w91.png?width=327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3125de1eff1dfd432c241c6824ed39354e3c931d\n\nWish me luck\u2026. Im hoping im not remind why I don\u2019t do overnight swings and why I don\u2019t play earnings at open tomorrow\u2026. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4woo38r68w91.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abaafefce87b6d1831a3e0441c9dca6802614ef1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/515srqpr68w91.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e06371a7308cf8a59d859691c3e910af22a3bfa4",

    "title": "Microsoft shares sink more than 8% on weak guidance but analysts bullish on rebound",
    "selftext": "Shares of Microsoft dropped as much as 8% early Wednesday, a day after the company released its fiscal first-quarter earnings.\n\nMicrosoft surpassed expectations on the top and bottom lines, but the stock was pressured by weak guidance and cloud revenue that missed expectations.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes the Azure public cloud, as well as Windows Server, SQL Server, Nuance and Enterprise Services, generated $20.33 billion in quarterly revenue, according to a company statement. That\u2019s up 20% but slightly less than the $20.36 billion consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Microsoft expects to see $52.35 billion to $53.35 billion in revenue for the fiscal second quarter, which implies 2% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had been looking for revenue of $56.05 billion.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella said cyclical trends are affecting Microsoft\u2019s consumer business on a conference call with analysts. CFO Amy Hood also said weak demand for PCs in September will continue to hit Microsoft\u2019s consumer segment, and said to a percentage decline in the high 30s for Windows revenue from devices makers in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts were not discouraged by the weaker, cyclical segments, and reiterated their buy rating on the stock. They said there\u2019s potential for those segments to rebound, and that companies are more likely to offer conservative guidance when faced with a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nThey believe there is potential for revenue re-acceleration next year.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond near-term dynamics, we remain constructive as we see the company well positioned to continue to win deals and expand its wallet share within its existing customer-base, even in a slower growth environment,\u201d they wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley also remain confident in Microsoft\u2019s growth potential despite its weak cyclical areas and guidance.\n\nThe strength of the company\u2019s positioning for core secular growth trends \u201cremains evident,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cBottom line, while heavier cyclical weights brings down our FY23 EPS estimates, we remain firmly convicted in the longer-term secular growth story at Microsoft,\u201d they said in a note Wednesday.\n\nBarclays analysts said Microsoft\u2019s quarterly outlook was a \u201cnegative surprise\u201d for investors, and that macroeconomic challenges are slowing migration to the cloud.\n\nHowever, they said in a Wednesday note that while \u201cshares will likely react negatively in the short term,\u201d the company\u2019s management is still guiding for revenue and profit that \u201cshould ensure relative outperformance.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft shares have fallen about 25% so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 stock index is down 19% over the same period.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/microsoft-stock-sinks-more-than-6percent-on-weak-guidance.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/microsoft-stock-sinks-more-than-6percent-on-weak-guidance.html)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is currently down 7% despite reporting earnings yesterday that beat estimates, however, revealed a weak quarterly guidance.

    "title": "FAANG + Microsoft are all still a genuinely attractive buy to me",
    "selftext": "Long story short I\u2019m finding these 6 stocks to be very attractive currently for the following reasons: \n\n1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.\n\n2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don\u2019t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they\u2019re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.\n\n3. For the ones that are less \u201cgold plated\u201d when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. \n\nI feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. \n\nRe: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they\u2019re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. \n\nHence, I feel there\u2019s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value. Thoughts?",

    "title": "Earning Express| Microsoft drops 6% in premarket after Q1 net profits down 14%",
    "selftext": "On Tuesday, Oct. 25, after the bell, [**Microsoft**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/) announced its results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023 ending Sept. 30.\n\nThe financial results show that Microsoft's eps for the first fiscal quarter was $2.35, down 13%, but still higher than market expectations of $2.29; operating income rose 11% year-on-year to $50.1 billion, higher than market expectations of $49.56 billion.\n\nDuring the reporting period, Microsoft's operating profit was $21.5 billion, up 6 percent year-over-year. The net profit was $17.6 billion, down 14 percent year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft reached the most severe net profit decline in more than two years and the lowest revenue growth since 2017.\n\nFiscal first-quarter intelligent cloud revenue of $20.33 billion was essentially unchanged from analysts' expectations of $20.31 billion. Microsoft Cloud's revenue of $25.7 billion was slightly higher than analysts' expectations of $25.66 billion, and personal computer revenue of $13.33 billion was higher than market expectations of $13.08 billion.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows operating system fell 15 percent in the fiscal first-quarter quarter, with PC sales down this year after a spike in sales during the epidemic. revenue from the Azure cloud computing platform and other cloud services grew 35 percent, but that growth rate has slowed significantly compared with 50 percent a year ago. According to a recent report by market research firm Canalys, global shipments of desktops and laptops fell 18 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. The technology analyst firm said laptop shipments were hit particularly hard.\n\nIn addition, the strong U.S. dollar has hampered Microsoft's growth. The U.S. dollar index has risen nearly 15 percent since the beginning of the year. Nearly half of Microsoft's sales come from overseas, and the strong dollar means less revenue.\n\nIn the earnings conference call, Microsoft executives expect currency factors to cause a 5% cut in full-year sales growth, an $800 million in additional energy/power costs for the year. Microsoft sees Azure sales growth to slow by 5% in the second fiscal quarter, PC revenue expected to be $14.5-14.9 billion, and operating expenses expected to be $14.3-14.4 billion, with poor PC demand reducing full-year operating profit.\n\nAfter the release of the Q1 financial report, [**Microsoft**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/)'s share price fell 6% in premarket trading.\n\nIn terms of new business, computer games are becoming an increasingly important business for Microsoft, but the company has to face the reality that people are spending less time on games as the epidemic ends.\n\nDespite this, Microsoft bets heavily in the industry by buying Activision Blizzard for $75 billion, which expects to close by the end of June next year.\n\nAs companies grapple with high inflation, rising interest rates, and economic concerns, Microsoft said they are using more of its software and cloud services to improve efficiency and flexibility. \n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft said it would cut jobs to adapt to the changing outlook.\n\nSo far this year, [**Microsoft**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/) shares fell about 25 percent, slightly better than the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is down 28 percent.",

A very clear chart showing the trend of META's **quarterly revenue**, the polemic **R&amp;D expense as a % of total revenue** and the **Free Cash Flow generated in the same period**. I have plotted the last 9 periods (quarters) so you can see the trend and then we will compare with the chart of Meta share price where you will see clearly why/how the market is concerned. \n\nTake 1 minute to read properly and understand the trend:\n\n[Yes, FCF my friends. The FCF!!!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/e8n65aywxsw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a4451bb8606c90e5ebc61359f7a8730f7234d7)\n\nSo what is the problem with the above chart?\n\nThe FCF has been ERASED! The only big tech that has decided to smash its cash flow generation capacity. Zuck doesn't care. He is all in into the METAVERSE. F\\* you shareholders. Investment returns? You should have bought APPLE.\n\nThat's why you see the following QoQ share price action in the same period (I have plotted 99$ in Sep 30, but it should be 27 Oct):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixamkk9jysw91.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78772ec49e6c324d8e4f48add37ba5476178d434\n\nBut hold on, what is all that cash burn rate? What is Zuckerberg doing with our cash?\n\nWell he anounced the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|In Billions $|2022|2023|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total Expenses|86|100|\n\n100 F\\*ing Billion per year! Hey Regards, he could be buying your entire GME company 12 times each of these 2 years. \n\nBut... was this a SHHURPRISE? Mmm... no! This is what he already anounced last year, and the stock did a rally from 320$ to the 340$ after releasing this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[So still spending 10 Billiones below what he told us for FY2022](https://preview.redd.it/82o77zt30tw91.jpg?width=1560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97950cce7dfe04df98895f0b8e0ebf757d69e4ef)\n\nThe capital he will allocate in CAPEX will be 33-34 Bn$ each year, in 2022 and 2023. This is basically data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. As he says, \"increase in AI capacity\"\n\nSo...\n\nhow is the cash position of META compared to the other big techs? The below data is Cash and Cash equivalent LESS Debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1h23m1j0tw91.jpg?width=724&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3dcd3daecd6abddbe16299ebb189ae29ab02a2\n\nThe share price is trading where it should be... specially when you see how Apple, Googl and MSFT are already on good track with their business, generating a massive amount of cash. Zuckerberg is DESPERATE and for him this is a survival path. \n\nOCULUS is unique. We can't discuss this. He is leading the hardware of the METAVERSE. The issue is the software, games, education, office/work application... we still have a close to none adoption rate I'd say, that's why market is skeptic. Should we give him a chance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I hold a bag of 200 shares with an avg. of 160$ I beleive... This is not a financial advice, nor I know how to advice you. Just buy APPLE for the long term....I mean do your own research. Ah...I hold a bag of Apple Puts that also hurts.",

    "selftext": "During the latest earnings season, Mega caps names disappointed investors with challenging results. In particular, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 7.72%, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down 9.63% and Meta (META) suffers a brutal 24.56% drop following the latest earnings. Instead, there are some old companies more than 100 years old that are worth looking at as investors are looking for opportunities in quality \u201cold\u201d companies.\n\n## 1. [EQT Corporation (EQT)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-EQT/)\n\nEQT which was founded in 1888, is one of the oldest stocks. The majority of analysts (77%) are bullish on the energy company, and they expect the stock to rally 56% from there. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report last month that ETO-Top's risk-reward setup was the \"best\" among its peers heading into the winter this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vc2i9nhj7cx91.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04abdf7e3379f021d172ed5d6210412380efce73\n\nAs Europe\u2019s gas price skyrocketing for the year and oil price globally has risen substantially this year due to the war in Russia and Ukraine providing tight supply. Europe could be headed for tough winters for the next 10 years and the supply shortages are likely the keep natural gas prices on a volatile upswing. The EQT should be benefited from tight supply and strong demand from Europe.\n\n## 2. [General Motors (GM)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-GM/)\n\nGeneral Motors was founded in 1908 and has a buy rating from 62.5% of analysts. At the current price, the stock is expected to rise 25.7%. General Motors comfortably beat earnings expectations last week, but revenue was slightly below expectations and it maintained its full-year outlook. Either way, GM reported profits a full 20 percent higher than expected, triggering the rally in GM shares. The stock rose 3.6% on earnings day and is up 6.8% in the three trading days since the results were released.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1k80m9k7cx91.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d6829e9bb4ddad3b912b957f7b4f87341f94c8b\n\nIn particular, the company's \"adjusted automotive free cash flow\" in the quarter, after excluding capital expenditures and adding royalties, went from a negative $4.4 billion a year ago to an impressive positive $4.6 billion this year. Given the EV trend and the huge market ahead, GM seems attractive at the current level.",

XBOX exclusive.\n\nBut as stated many many times by Microsoft  it would be asinine for them to do that. They would be literally shooting themselves in the foot if they did so.\n\n It would :\n\n1. Tank their deal,\n\n2. Antitrust lawmakers will be up their ass.\n\n3. And It would reduce their income by half ! At least in the short term.\n\nSo this deal looks very solid to me. \n\nBrazil and  Saudi Arabia have already given their OK, and UK is deliberating. Also, The FTC could reportedly rule on Microsoft\u2019s Activision deal by late November : \n\nhttps://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-ftc-could-reportedly-rule-on-microsofts-activision-deal-by-late-november/\n\nThat is a very big catalyst, and it's looking more and more likely by the day.",

    "selftext": "**Upcoming Department of Defense Contract - Its a possibility - $MSFT and Kandy**\n\nA multi-page PDF is available from the call held on Sunday evening describing one investor's (mine) illustration of how Kandy would fit into the upcoming J.W.C.C.award announcement. (read as \"upgraded cloud for the federal government and for the department of defense\")\n\nKandy activitiy seems to be in two buckets:\n\nPath A. an amazing amount of fine-tuning of Kandy to work underneath the Microsoft Teams Chat hood. Alot of this work was done between Microsoft and Ribbon, and then now Advent Technologies fully owns Kandy and seems to have recently completed the DRaas component requested or needed by $MSFT. So, relating to pathway A: this is at least one scenario for a buy out from one of the primes that is part of the IDIQ award on J.W.C.C.\n\nPath B. to prepare Kandy as a pure cloud play solution, hence a keen focus on various softphone tools being able to integrated via the wrappers and software development libraries (sdk), and a focus on Kandy as a reseller of at least one of them called acrobits.\n\nPath B is an obvious 100% focus should there be now buyout or Kandy is not playing a role in the federated communication model / dod communication model. Path B can exist in conjunction with Path A. Professional services headcount for Path B would utilize the various partners listed that are armed with the Kandy solution.\n\nAs a side note, J.W.C.C. replaces the original J.E.D.I. contract. Microsoft and Amazon are incumbents on the militarized and/or federated cloud with the U.S. Government. The PDF-file shows how the pieces are put together, as a possible solution based solely on due diligence.\n\nAs a key note, the due diligence stems from not only the author but a slew of persons reviewing hints and financials during multiple conference calls over the last few months.\n\nA validation that has come through is the secure version of Microsoft's Azure cloud to be utilized by military contractors such as Lockheed Martin.\n\nA URL link is provided to the file share. Note the file share won't be active forever so ensure you download any files there you would like to keep. Good luck Kandy Collectors !\n\n**0 CommentsShareSavePost Insights**",

The EU competition enforcer said it would decide by March 23, 2023, whether to clear or block the deal.\n\nBritain's antitrust watchdog in September said it would launch a full-scale probe.\n\nThe acquisition could damage the industry if Microsoft refused to give rivals access to Activision's best-selling games, Britain's antitrust regulator has said.\n\nThe deal has drawn criticism from Sony, maker of the Playstation console, citing Microsoft's control of games like \"Call of Duty.\"\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-likely-file-lawsuit-block-225604898.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-likely-file-lawsuit-block-225604898.html)\n\nActivision Blizzard (ATVI) was down 3.5% in premarket trading after it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission is likely to sue to block Microsoft's (MSFT) $69 billion purchase of the videogame publisher.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)",

    "selftext": "I hope everyone had a great Christmas! SPY welcomed us today with the red and green. Another excruciatingly boring day after the first hour. A total lack of volume, follow through and overall technical support to moves. \n\nI saw this chart posted the other day and thought it was very interesting. I plan to at the EOY probably over new years 3 day weekend do a 2023 projection for big tech and SPY with where we possibly could go. But this chart shows that despite Tesla seemingly being the \u201ceasy\u201d short that Apple, Msft and Google (maybe Adobe) are the best shorts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ljb7ct2xi8a1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d814f48009be15da963fbb68113dff5e4a6f9ee\n\nhad to repost and block out what comes after 50- cause i guess thats a banned 3 letter word on here... -\\_-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltzju0l5xi8a1.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=377fae393fcd453f284c84deb72765836d633067\n\nHere we have the prices as of today 12/27 of optimized extreme bear plays for June 2023 for those above tickers. I plan to reference back to these throughout the year. I want to wait personally until the week of January 9th to open any long plays. For me I still believe that Apple, Msft, and Google are the best play. However, I honestly worry about how strong MSFT is and that it could actually hold up the best in a long drawdown.   \n \n\nIf I had to pick right now I would get SPY, Apple, Google and maybe Amazon puts. Netflix, adbe, nvidia are just too price already. And despite the probable Tesla downfall I wouldn\u2019t buy it without some sort of 20-30% relief bounce first.   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ok7tt5a6xi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a2a06aa45f70fcbfbc9ea8d48f43dc5fe4ca6c0\n\nWell SPY continues to be hella frustrating\u2026 Last week I mentioned with the daily 8ema rejection and break through 378 we should have and were setting up to see a bigger push down to 360-370. However, as you can see put in some really strong support at that 379.6 area and we have not been able to break that down. With that big bounce and breakout with bullish engulfing candle on Friday one would have suspected we were going to see 386-390 today. Even looking at futures overnight which were up 0.7% at one point one would have suspected a bigger move up today. \n\nHowever, we found that 383 actually was a very strong resistance area that we couldn\u2019t quite break through. Taking a look at this chart we have a generalized range of 379.6 to 386.3. however, when we look at the last 5 trading days besides December 21st we actually have a tighter range of 383 to 379.6. Todays hanging man candle actually formed a nice triple top at 383 too. Depending on the structure of tomorrows candle we could also turn this into a evening doji star pattern (bearish pattern). \n\nI have referenced my favorite diamond pattern many times before. This is about as tight of a diamond pattern as we could get (futes has it too). The way I see it that we either open over the blue support line of 382.2 (+0.2%) or we open under the red resistance line of 380.4 (-0.3%). I expect tomorrow to (and overnight) to establish the next 2-3 day move on SPY. \n\nIf we break the blue support line then we are likely to see 378 retested and if that fails im looking at 370.6 by EOW Friday. \n\nIf we breakout through the red resistance line (and more importantly the daily 8ema) then I will be eyeing a 386 to 390 retest by EOW. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wsb91w6xi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=719ad8e623df616a0b4a01cc293ddc1d6e851d43\n\nTaking a look at Futures we are in the exact same pattern as SPY daily. This nice big diamond pattern here. With this opening of the futures daily candle we have officially broken the support of the diamond pattern. Key resistance of this pattern is 3872.  \n\nI am eyeing next key consolidation level of 3845. We have bounced off this 3840 to 3850 support area 6 times in a row now. It is a very strong support area. If we lose that support its going to signal a pretty strong downturn. 3805 is the next major support. \n\nResistance is at 3880 and 3920. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acdv3fd7xi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9aaac7a42ec8d7290ec17b8c0452ee45d4735ba\n\nTesla is just full on capitulating at this point. I cant believe that it dropped almost 12% intraday today. \n\nTesla has dropped 45.6% in 17 trading days\u2026 Absolutely impressive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r7pmos7xi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b43c8d21e3cac5840750822beac5dbe1825a09a0\n\nWith tesla losing 111.4 weekly support. Next major levels I have are 94.4 and 60.7. Full on death to tesla is 27.8 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by January 2024.\n\nI really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that I could trust entering some puts on it. I just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last  month were free money on tesla\u2026 buy a put at these levels. But I also think buying a call is straight wasting money. I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grya1529xi8a1.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dca592f67cac02a750ec83b4b1de0655959cd4\n\nThe VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. \n\nThere are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. \n\nMarket wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow. \n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp1q7xi9xi8a1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bf160daf57c8923acbdd6f1dea99643055c1d7\n\nI felt like today reminded me a lot of Friday in that we had absolutely no sense of direction and no continuation. This morning the theta on premiums even my 7-8dte was aggressive too. Tough day to trade but was able to get in and out of some plays quickly and play some nice l2l. Overall not a great day but a green day at least.",

I cant believe that it dropped almost 12% intraday today. \n\nTesla has dropped 45.6% in 17 trading days\u2026 Absolutely impressive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf05k5brwi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3deb77f17a19c1079f74c484fa17b9733baf2473\n\nWith tesla losing 111.4 weekly support. Next major levels I have are 94.4 and 60.7. Full on death to tesla is 27.8 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by January 2024.\n\nI really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that I could trust entering some puts on it. I just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last  month were free money on tesla\u2026 buy a put at these levels. But I also think buying a call is straight wasting money. I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2frfe6eswi8a1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b00f47ba8fc18d7f7355731839b59434d9985a9\n\nThe VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. \n\nThere are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. \n\nMarket wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow. \n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luc5azuswi8a1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f655a2e3266f994a5c63faa3b7fac6d2cc502b6\n\nI felt like today reminded me a lot of Friday in that we had absolutely no sense of direction and no continuation. This morning the theta on premiums even my 7-8dte was aggressive too. Tough day to trade but was able to get in and out of some plays quickly and play some nice l2l. Overall not a great day but a green day at least.",

    "title": "The Big Short of 2023: Who is the next Tesla?",
    "selftext": "Well as we come to an EOY here and we have seen Tesla in my opinion begin the capitulation of tech and the market as a whole\u2026 I thought it would be worthwhile to an analysis of what the best potential short of big tech is for 2023. \n\nNow mind you this assumes obviously that we DO see a breakdown in q1. If we didn\u2019t get a breakdown while an individual like Tesla could still capitulate and see a correction\u2026 its possible no one becomes the best short. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0naetyw7po8a1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704c0ef0f040e5eeb2ce06ef93452b57bb5d259a\n\nNote- all data for this document was obtained on 12/27 during and after market close. \n\nNow lets go ahead and break this all down and rank them\u2026 what I am going to do is rank 1 through 9\u2026 1 would be a bearish indicator on the stock and a 9 would be a bullish indicator. \n\n**What is Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E?**\n\nThe forward P/E uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. The trailing P/E, which is the standard form of a price-to-earnings ratio, is calculated using recent past earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de6ha5h8po8a1.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d059b0b2296346ca71885894283b9bce0959276d\n\nBased on standard PE we actually see that Amazon has the current highest PE at 78.28 and Meta (not surprisingly) has the lowest PE at 11.24). This would indicate a strike against Amazon and make it strictly looking at PE the best short. This would obviously make Meta the worse short. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qa8hslx8po8a1.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f629576a31bde62cbce6f297ab42cb71f85d7a4\n\nTaking a look at forward P/E you can see that still Amazon with 50.57 has the worst F P/E and Meta at 14.72 has the most favorable PE. \n\n**What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krqn1zm9po8a1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5b022629ae3b14369bb3e2e90e3cd02f6d3dbc\n\nThe price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. A PEG ratio of under 1.0 can indicate a stock is undervalued and a potential buy. A PEG above 1.0 can indicate an overvalued stock.\n\nTaking a look at the PEG ratio (remember the higher the level the most overbought/ over valued the stock is) we see that nvidia with a 3.55 is the most overbought and amazon comes in next with a 2.95. Not surprising Tesla has the lowest at 0.84 (mostly due to the 40%+ drop in the month of December). \n\n**% changes from critical points** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1oa9bbapo8a1.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9f1dd84c3b859eb07e0e10be2c8509d6033f00\n\nTaking a look at the YTD drop Tesla has had the biggest YTD drop at 71.48% and SPY actually had the smallest YTD drop of just 17.33%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwpdu7uapo8a1.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98af72979fe04efca15539a8171f6ce9dd363cb0\n\nThis breakdown here represents how far above or below the ticker currently is of its weekly 200ema. Apple, MSFT and SPY are the only tickers above its weekly 200ema (the positive number) and all the other tickers are below that number (represented by the negative number). The number represents what % below or % above the weekly 200ema they are\u2026  \n \n\nCurrently Apple is the further above its weekly 200ema which could represent that it has the biggest room to fall\u2026 Meta is the furthest below its Weekly 200ema. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aghcqxdbpo8a1.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0c9617fbf5c5fc1c7cee4a8209cebb431bf1b7\n\nTaking a look at the % the ticker currently sits below its ATH. You can see that Tesla is sitting -74.7% below its ATH while SPY is only 20.6% below its ATH making SPY potentially have the biggest room to fall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7po7icxbpo8a1.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb081d2e6f53b36856a35927e0df4299bce58bf\n\nThis one here represent how far above or below the current ticker is from the 2020 Covid crash lows. Many believe that the 2020 covid lows is the likely target if we have a market wide sell off in Q1. As you can see Nvidia and Meta are the only tickers below their covid 2020 lows. \n\nTesla surprisingly is still 78.6% above its Covid 2020 low. \n\n**June 16th 2023 Put Premium**\n\nUsing the optionscalculator to \u201coptimize\u201d the best put play I came up with the following strikes for potential June 16th DTE puts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfowsdfcpo8a1.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=390f7e1b70c7831d2f4097635253db4d4db3b51c\n\nThe reason I wanted to include this as it shows how pricey premiums already are. As you can see Tesla not surprisingly due to its high IV and further drop expectations is one of the highest premiums and Google remains the lowest. \n\n**Lets rank the most \u201covervalued\u201d and most \u201coversold\u201d**  \n   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usobec0dpo8a1.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb728f541467c395e1950e87dbf9bbf9a363951\n\nRemember we ranked 1 through 9. With 1 being overvalued and 9 being oversold. Therefore the lower the overall numbers using all the above metrics the potential better short a stock ticker is. \n\nSo taking a look here we see that Apple is the clear short winner with Amazon, MSFT, and SPY close behind. \n\nNow lets take a look at these and where we could be heading. We will take a look at Apple, Amazon, MSFT and SPY weekly charts. \n\n**Apple Weekly chart** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4nm4xkdpo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe8cf5e35b2a2f82460e17891d83eb9f6768c92\n\nThe apple weekly chart in my opinion has the most room to fall\u2026 a few big targets to keep in mind here\u2026 \n\nWeekly 200ema- 120.15\n\nLate 2020 support- 106.9\n\nMarch 2020 support- 57.4\n\nCurrent bear channel march projection- 64.33 \n\nCurrent bear channel June projection- 44.15\n\n**Amazon Weekly Chart** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7y6a83epo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3da709dfc0f93152e1a3d74acf28d086eefa5ad\n\nTaking a look here you can see we have been riding down the weekly 8ema and we are within a few weeks of the death cross on amazon (100ema below 200ema). \n\nMarch 2020 support- $81.74\n\nCurrent bear channel march projection- $47.31 \n\nCurrent bear channel June projection- $32\n\n2017 support- $47.31\n\n2016 support- $24.36\n\n**MSFT weekly chart**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zetxxbmepo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a1b52631108877f5136f2aa0c57a2ca03449944\n\nNow when you take a look at MSFT I think much like apple it has one of the strongest of big techs charts this year. It has not seen that massive drop like most of tech has. However, Apple and MSFT are obviously the biggest holdings in SPY for a reason\u2026\n\nWeekly 200ema- $224.47\n\nLate 2020 support- $196.4\n\nMarch 2020 support- $136.8\n\nCurrent bear channel march projection- $177.85 \n\nCurrent bear channel June projection- $157.57\n\n**SPY weekly chart**\n\nLast but not least is our boy spy\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oset9i8fpo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7388a2aa00b12725009ceb5af661497cc2906051\n\nTaking a look at SPY here you can see that we have that similar breakdown as big tech but our bear channel is way wider than most of tech. \n\nWeekly 200ema- $366.89\n\nLate 2020 support- $325.6\n\nMarch 2020 support- $228\n\nCurrent bear channel march projection- $300 \n\nCurrent bear channel June projection- $281\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it guys\u2026 what I am calling \u201cThe Big Short of 2023.\u201d \n\nWhich ticker do you think is the best short? For me from a strictly technical stand point SPY and Apple are the best shorts. However, when I look at everything I personally feel like Amazon is the best potential big short of 2023.",
